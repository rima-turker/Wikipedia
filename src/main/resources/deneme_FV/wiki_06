Early life.
Johnson grew up in <a href="Hudson%20Bend%2C%20Texas">Hudson Bend, Texas</a>, a suburb of <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a> near <a href="Lake%20Travis">Lake Travis</a>. Her father was descended from Austin's famed <a href="Old%20Three%20Hundred">Old Three Hundred</a>, and her mother's ancestors included those who helped build the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> (1836-45). When Johnson was seven, she started cooking, occasionally making dishes for herself, her parents and her brother.

Upon reaching adulthood, she attended the <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Boston">University of Massachusetts Boston</a> (UMass Boston), where she studied Biology. After a year at UMass Boston, she transferred to the <a href="University%20of%20Texas">University of Texas</a> in Austin, where she finished with a degree in <a href="Botany">Botany</a>. After college, she was part of a rock band called The Hot As Shits, and she also joined an <a href="improvisational%20theatre">improv</a> troupe in Austin called Big ol’ Tire Fire. There, she met a burgeoning filmmaker named Christopher Sharpe.

Over the next few years, Johnson and Sharpe began collaborating on several projects. They worked together on the <a href="short%20film">short film</a> "Freerange Asshole"; she had an acting role and served as costume designer, while he worked behind the scenes as a sound mixer. They also worked together on an <a href="independent%20film">indie</a> horror flick which he directed and in which she starred, though the film never got <a href="post-production">finished</a>.

The success of "Hilah Cooking" had led to a spin-off series, "Hilah's Texas Kitchen", seen on <a href="Tastemade">Tastemade</a>. On this show, Johnson travels to eateries all over the state of Texas to sample various <a href="Texas%20cuisine">Texas cuisine</a>, as prepared by expert chefs. She then shows viewers an easy way to prepare these dishes themselves.

In addition to her online shows, Johnson has also written five books on cooking. In 2017, she debuted a new <a href="podcast">podcast</a>, "Hilah's Happy Hour".

Hams, Chudleigh

Hams is an historic estate situated within the parish of <a href="Chudleigh">Chudleigh</a> in Devon. The surviving remnant of the former mansion house of the Hunt family, known as Hams <a href="Barton%20%28demesne%29">Barton</a> is a <a href="Listed%20building">grade II* listed</a> building, situated one mile north-east of the town of Chudleigh, near Kate Brook. 

History.
The Hunt family was settled at Hams before the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603). Thomas Hunt (d.1548) was thrice <a href="Mayor%20of%20Exeter">Mayor of Exeter</a>, including in 1517 and 1537. The last entry of the name in the Parish Register is the burial of Thomas Hunt in 1730. According to the Devonshire historian <a href="Richard%20Polwhele">Polwhele</a>: ""Hams was an estate of very considerable extent when in possession of the Hunts"". It afterwards belonged to the Inglett family (later Fortescue-Inglett) of <a href="Buckland%20Filleigh">Buckland Filleigh</a>, who sold it to a certain Mr Beech, who sold it to <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Palk%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Robert Palk, 1st Baronet</a> (1717-1798) of <a href="Haldon%20House">Haldon House</a> in the parish of <a href="Kenn%2C%20Devon">Kenn</a>, Devon. It was sold by Palk to <a href="Charles%20Clifford%2C%206th%20Baron%20Clifford%20of%20Chudleigh">Charles Clifford, 6th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh</a> (1759–1831), of <a href="Ugbrooke">Ugbrooke</a> within the parish of Chudleigh, and in 1852 belonged to his son <a href="Hugh%20Clifford%2C%207th%20Baron%20Clifford%20of%20Chudleigh">Hugh Clifford, 7th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh</a> (1790–1858). Hams was originally a large Elizabethan structure, approached by an avenue. In 1852 it had descended in status to a farm house, situated in a court, and surrounded by a few chestnut trees. The principal doorway and several others are arched and made of granite. The ceilings of some of the rooms are supported by oak beams, smoothed and jointed and in 1852 the windows were "of the ancient form, some of them are now blocked up or modernized". A fine banquetting room survives, called by <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Pevsner</a> "the sumptuous first-floor great chamber, one of the best of its date in the county", with fireplace overmantle inscribed with the date "1621" and displaying the arms of Hunt ("Azure, on a bend between two water bougets or three leopard's faces gules") impaling Meredith commemorating the marriage of Bennett Hunt (1573-1643), <a href="Mayor%20of%20Exeter">Mayor of Exeter</a>, and Elizabeth Meredith (d.1659), a daughter of Thomas Meredith of <a href="Slapton">Slapton</a>. The Bennett family at that time resided at nearby <a href="Whiteway%20House">Whiteway</a>. On the opposite wall are the royal arms. The couple's mural monument survives in Chudleigh Church inscribed: ""Here lyeth the body of Bennett Hunt of Hams, in this p'ish, esqr. who was buried ye first day of July, Anno Dom. 1643, aged 70 years. Also the body of Elizabeth Hunt, the wife of Bennett Hunt, was buried the 2d day of November, 1659. Also the body of Nicholas Hunt, son of Bennett Hunt, was buried the 19h day of October, 1639, aged 22 years. Also the body of Frances, ye wife of John Hunt of Hams, esqr. was buried the 26h day of March, 1672."" Other monuments to the family also survive in the church.

183rd Street (NYC station)

183rd Street was a station on the <a href="Harlem%20Line">Harlem Line</a> and of the <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a> which served the communities of <a href="Fordham%2C%20Bronx">Fordham</a>, <a href="Tremont%2C%20Bronx">Tremont</a> and <a href="Belmont%2C%20Bronx">Belmont</a> in the borough of <a href="The%20Bronx">The Bronx</a>. The <a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20Haven%20and%20Hartford%20Railroad">New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad</a> also ran through this station but did not stop here.

History.
The <a href="New%20York%20and%20Harlem%20Railroad">New York and Harlem Railroad</a> expanded their main line across the Harlem River through Tremont into <a href="Fordham%20%28Metro-North%20station%29">Fordham</a> in 1841. Stations existed both in Tremont and Fordham back then, but not at 183rd Street. The New York and Harlem was bought by the <a href="New%20York%20Central%20and%20Hudson%20River%20Railroad">New York Central and Hudson River Railroad</a> in 1864, but didn't build a station at this location until sometime between 1898 and 1901.

On July 1, 1901, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Elevated%20Railway">Metropolitan Elevated Railway</a> (later acquired by the <a href="Interborough%20Rapid%20Transit%20Company">Interborough Rapid Transit Company</a>) extended the <a href="IRT%20Third%20Avenue%20Line">Third Avenue Elevated Line</a> to Fordham Station, bringing a rapid transit connection there. <a href="Fordham%20Road%20%E2%80%93%20190th%20Street%20%28IRT%20Third%20Avenue%20Line%29">Pelham Avenue station</a> was the northern terminus of the line until it was extended to <a href="Bronx%20Park%20Terminal%20%28IRT%20Third%20Avenue%20Line%29">Bronx Park Terminal</a> ten months later. As a result, the <a href="Third%20Avenue%20Railway">Third Avenue Railway</a> also began to operate from Fordham Plaza converting it into the major transit hub that it is to this day. 183rd Street Station was built just in time to deal with the capacity issues at Fordham Station to the north, though the Third Avenue El also had another station on 183rd Avenue nearly several blocks to the east.

Declining ridership following World War II, coincided with the decline of much of the Bronx. As with other NYC stations in the Bronx, 183rd Street became a <a href="Penn%20Central">Penn Central</a> station once the NYC & <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>s merged in 1968.

Haderslev Cathedral

Haderslev Cathedral () also known as Our Lady's Church is the cathedral church of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Haderslev">Diocese of Haderslev</a> located in <a href="Haderslev">Haderslev</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>

History.
The wooden church.
It is assumed that the oldest church building in <a href="Haderslev">Haderslev</a> was probably made of wood, and it probably was located in the place where the present church building is found, but no traces of it have been found. Nonetheless, this is not recorded anywhere and is highly unlikely that there has been a wooden church before the quarantine church, believed to be built in the second half of the 1100s. The oldest traces of the city of Haderslev originates from the 1100s.

1100s.
The first church building we know was a Romanesque quarantine church. It was undoubtedly built around the middle of the 1100s, and after its destruction a hundred years later its granite blocks were used in the foundation of the new church building and recycled by subsequent rebuilding. It is still seen in the choir and west wall of the present church, as well as at the entrance to the northern door of the church, and provides certain information about the shape and decoration of this church. It thus appears that it must have had a half-round crossing. A pebbly stone in the southwest corner of the present church deserves special attention, because as it is very likely the cornerstone.
1200s.
It has previously been assumed that the quarantine church was destroyed in connection with the wars between <a href="Eric%20IV%20of%20Denmark">Eric IV of Denmark</a> and <a href="Abel%2C%20King%20of%20Denmark">Abel, King of Denmark</a> in 1247, but there is no evidence that these wars affected the church. The destruction was probably more about tearing down the too modest old church to construct a larger church with an appearance that suited an expanding city. The quarantine church was replaced with a large brick church in mixed Romanesque-Gothic style. Remains of this church were later used in the construction of the Church of St Nicholas in <a href="Aabenraa">Aabenraa</a> and in the Cistercian church in <a href="L%C3%B8gumkloster">Løgumkloster</a>.

One can still imagine its exterior by considering the <a href="transept">transept</a> of the present church, built by large yellow and pink stones, which can easily be distinguished from subsequent changes and extensions whose stone is dark red. The southern <a href="gable">gable</a> is the best preserved part of the building from this period.

In 1270 a significant rebuilding took place. The church was constructed in a <a href="Hall%20church">Hall church</a> model after the North German model, with two side aisles, whose width corresponded to half of the main aisle. The church was larger than the previous one, reflecting the church's new title of a <a href="collegiate%20church">collegiate church</a>. As such, it was mentioned for the first time in 1273, when it was given to the Bishop of Schleswig to be part of Aller parish. It was then necessary to include a number of altars for the Collegiate Chapter.

1400s.
The history of Our Lady's Church is closely linked to the common political and cultural development of <a href="Southern%20Jutland">Southern Jutland</a>, and in particular, the events associated with the war of <a href="Eric%20of%20Pomerania">Eric of Pomerania</a> with the Holstein Greeks from 1410 to 1435. In those years, the old Schleswig Diocese was divided between the two parties, and the struggles waved especially back and forth in the area around <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>. This meant that the connection between the collegiate chapter of Haderslev to the Diocese of Schleswig was discontinued and soon a plan was made to separate Haderslev from Schleswig and create a separate Diocese of Haderslev.

In 1415 King Erik secured the Our Lady Church in Haderslev and the whole chapter with offices and cannons, against any kind of taxation and other inconveniences. At the same time, the revenues of a number of churches were given to Our Lady's Church in Haderslev, which riches left it with significant large estates. This financial stability granted the chapter the necessarily means to rebuild the church. The new larger church was built between 1420-1440 reflecting the new plans which wanted to create a new diocese with Our Lady's church as its cathedral. The men behind the construction project wanted to create a gothic cathedral, fully worthy of being the main church of an independent Haderslev Diocese. In fact, a document from that time already referred to the new church as Haderslev Cathedral.

<a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a> fell in 1431 to the Holstein Greeks who prevailed in the long-standing war with <a href="Erik%20of%20Pomerania">Erik of Pomerania</a>, and the dream of a separate Haderslev Diocese had to be abandoned. The bishop of Schleswig demanded that the construction of the new Haderslev church should be stopped, however the church was still completed in a high gothic style with tall apses and transept. A tower was later built with a saddle roof. A number of chapels were added to the church building during the late Middle Ages.
Reformation.
In 1525 the Collegiate church of Our Lady in <a href="Haderslev">Haderslev</a> became the country's first evangelical Lutheran church after the change in the <a href="Church%20of%20Denmark">Church of Denmark</a> from <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> to <a href="Lutheranism">evangelical Lutheran</a> under the initiatives of <a href="Christian%20III%20of%20Denmark">Christian III of Denmark</a>. In fact Haderslev can therefore be rightly called the "Nordic Wittenberg".

Fire.
In 1627, troops of the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a> caused a terrible fire that hit the church and a large part of the city. The great tower of the church and its western part, as well as the entire northwestern part of the present church building, became a victim of the flames. Restoration and reconstruction progressed slowly and was only completed in 1650. There was no way to restore the church in its original form. The great west side of the church was rebuilt. The main entrance was built using both Renaissance and Baroque architecture. All recent restorations have preserved the church in the shape it had in 1650.

Cathedral Church.
The <a href="Diocese%20of%20Haderslev">Diocese of Haderslev</a> was created in 1922 and Our Lady's church was chosen as the cathedral of the diocese. Thus, after nearly 500 years since rebuilding the church with the intention of becoming a cathedral, Our Lady's church became an official cathedral in its own right. 
Later Renovations.
The church was last restored between 1941-51 where the whole of the church was whitewashed. A few paintings were uncovered, amongst them 12 seals of different families from southern Jutland and Holstein Families, another of <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a>, and in the north crossing one depicting <a href="Saint%20Barbara">Saint Barbara</a>. The restoration was done by architects <a href="Harald%20L%C3%B8nborg-Jensen">Harald Lønborg-Jensen</a> and Helge Holm, thereby giving the church its current appearance. In the summer of 2009, a major repair was done on the south side of the roof, which was damaged because of the rain and other elements.

Interior.
Altar.
The present high altar was added to the church during the renovations of 1941-51. The altar table was designed by Lønborg Jensen. A medieval top with incisions was also added. The crucifix above the altar dates from the 1300s brought over from Egebjerg in <a href="Odsherred%20Municipality">Odsherred</a>. The cross includes the four symbols of the evangelists. The cross also features the figures Mary and John dating from the 1400s and originated from Seem Church near <a href="Ribe">Ribe</a>. The figures of the twelve apostles date from the 1400s and were previously located in Hertug Hans Hospitalskirke in <a href="Haderslev">Haderslev</a>.

Pulpit and Baptismal font.
The pulpit and its top were donated by Georg von Ahlefeldt and Margrete Blumen in 1636. The stairs leading to the pulpit and the pulpit is decorated with figures of the apostles. The Baptismal fount is made of bronze, was made in 1485 in <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>. The font is lifted by 4 figures of the 4 evangelists.

Organ.
The organ originates from 1652 and was made by Peter Carstensen. The organ was restored in 1948 by <a href="Marcussen%20%26amp%3B%20S%C3%B8n">Marcussen & Søn</a>. The organ currently has 73 pipes divided into four manuals and pedals, making it one of the largest in Denmark.

Epitaphs in the cathedral.
Similar to most city churches, Haderslev Cathedral also houses a number of historically and artistically valuable epitaphs, reminiscent of the famous people of the city and the church in the 1600s and 1700s. These memorial, along with some paintings with biblical motifs, are hung on the church's walls. The epitaphs of the priests of the church were written in Latin, while the memorials of notable citizens were written in German, which was the official language of the town, although most citizens spoke their Danish dialect in their daily lives.

Other works of art.
In the southern side of the cathedral there several paintings, including an aftermath of unknown artists high up on the east wall. The painting has been part of the church's former altarpiece. The motif is derived from the renowned renaissance painter Peter Candid's Last supper. The cathedral has 18 chandeliers, the two oldest are from 1605 and 1655 respectively. The Votive ship represents the shipwreck of Fyn from 1950.

Frosty the Dopeman

Frosty the Dopeman is a character created by American songwriter, visual artist and social critic Marc Zydiak (1953-) in a song of the same name from his self-titled debut LP (Nirvana Records NR-1009) released in 1977.

While a college student, Zydiak wrote the song in 1972 after reading a newspaper article on the Illinois Crime Commission’s issuance of its advisory to radio stations with a list of popular songs containing “drug-oriented lyrics”. Among the titles on the Commission’s banned song list were Jefferson Airplane’s <a href="White%20Rabbit%20%28song%29">"White Rabbit"</a>, The Beatles’ <a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%28song%29">"Yellow Submarine"</a> and <a href="Lucy%20in%20the%20Sky%20with%20Diamonds">"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"</a> and Peter, Paul & Mary’s <a href="Puff%2C%20the%20Magic%20Dragon">"Puff The Magic Dragon"</a>, each of which to Zydiak’s mind were rooted in children themes.

Thinking back to his family’s endless listenings to <a href="Mitch%20Miller">Mitch Miller</a>’s Christmas LPs of his own childhood, Zydiak recognized that the original lyrics to the perennial holiday classic “<a href="Frosty%20the%20Snowman">Frosty the Snowman</a>”, with his “corn cob pipe” , “magic hat”, and authoritarian “cop” were already primed for a drug song parody.

After the song's release, <a href="Dr.%20Demento">Dr. Demento</a> began playing Zydiak’s “Frosty the Dopeman” on his <a href="KMET">KMET</a> syndicated radio program in Los Angeles and included the song on his "Dementia Royale" compilation (<a href="Rhino%20Records">Rhino Records</a> 1980).

The song is noteworthy for its utilization of a unique combination of both musical <a href="parody">parody</a> and political <a href="satire">satire</a> and has been recognized for its influence on popular culture in the books Just Say Noel : A History of Christmas from the Nativity to the Nineties and The Curious World of Drugs and Their Friends – A Very Trippy Miscellany. 

"Frosty the Dopeman" has also been referenced by Kemper Wolf-Reinhard in his scholarly treatise Kokain in der Musik : Bestandaufnahme und Analyse aus kriminologischer Perspektive, a psychology dissertation on the cultural, scientific, and social history of counterculture music's influence on the mind.

“Frosty the Dopeman” is mentioned in <a href="Keenen%20Ivory%20Wayans">Keenen Ivory Wayans</a>’ 2001 horror comedy film <a href="Scary%20Movie%202">Scary Movie 2</a> in the scene where Shorty (<a href="Marlon%20Wayans">Marlon Wayans</a>) is taking care of his pot plant and, just before he himself gets smoked, sees a TV ad for Lockdown Records’ new release “A Hip-Hop Christmas - Where you’ll get such classics as… and who could forget "Frosty the Dopeman"?

“Frosty the Dopeman” has been given new life in the internet age. The song has been much imitated ever since by everyone from school kids to rap artists with many different versions and videos of it viewable on YouTube.

The body colour is grey rather than the olive green of "Natrix natrix". The species is found in Great Britain as far north as southern Scotland, Switzerland, Italy, France and western Germany. The snake, which eats amphibians like newts and frogs, can grow to a length of one metre.

Order of the Ship

The Order of the Ship ("Ordre de la Nef") was a secular <a href="order%20of%20knighthood">order of knighthood</a> in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">Kingdom of Naples</a> founded and dedicated to the <a href="Holy%20Trinity">Holy Trinity</a> by King <a href="Charles%20III%20of%20Naples">Charles III</a> of the <a href="Capetian%20House%20of%20Anjou">House of Durazzo</a> on 1 December 1381 and defunct by 1386.

Charles III was crowned King of Naples in the <a href="Castel%20Nuovo">Castel Nuovo</a> in Naples on 25 November. During the festivities that followed, he inducted seven or eight knights into a new order of his own creation at a ceremony in the great chapel of the Castel Nuovo on 1 December. In this he was probably imitating the founding of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Knot">Order of the Knot</a> by King <a href="Louis%20I%20of%20Naples">Louis I</a> twenty years earlier on 25 May 1352, the same day as his coronation. Although there were present in Naples men who would have remembered the founding of the Order of the Knot, but it is unlikely that Charles sought to revive the Order of the Knot, defunct since Louis's death in 1362, since Louis's heirs were Charles's rivals for the throne.

The only contemporary evidence for the structure and history of the order are two copies of its statutes, both composed in <a href="Middle%20French">Middle French</a>. The original master copy of the statutes, the "Livre de estatus et chapistrez", which was also in French and was to be kept in the order's chapel, is lost. It was probably richly illustrated in imitation of that of the Order of the Knot. The statutes themselves are modelled on those of the Order of the Knot and the Hungarian <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20George%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%29">Order of Saint George</a>, of which Charles was a member. The two manuscripts are French 83 in the <a href="Van%20Pelt%20Library">Van Pelt Library</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> and L III 29 of the <a href="Biblioteca%20nazionale%20universitaria%20di%20Torino">Biblioteca nazionale universitaria</a> in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>. According to the Pennsylvania manuscript, the order had eight original members (Charles and seven others), while the Turin manuscript lists eight knights besides Charles. Eight other men are recorded elsewhere as having been members of the order at some point, based largely on sepulchral inscriptions.

It is unlikely that the Order of the Ship was very active, since Charles III not only had to fight wars to keep his Neapolitan throne, but also laid claim to the Hungarian throne in 1382. He was assassinated in Hungary on 24 February 1386, leaving a child, <a href="Ladislaus%20of%20Naples">Ladislaus</a>, as his heir under the regency of his widow, <a href="Margaret%20of%20Durazzo">Margaret</a>. The Order of the Ship, if it was still active in any sense, died with Charles. During her regency, Margaret instituted a new order ("compagnia") the device of which was a gold-embroidered <a href="Spindle%20%28textiles%29">spindle</a> or <a href="Capstan%20%28nautical%29">capstan</a> ("argata") on a red field. There is no evidence that Ladislaus continued either his father's or his mother's order.

The first historian to write about the Order of the Ship was <a href="Pandolfo%20Collenuccio">Pandolfo Collenuccio</a> in his "Compendio dell'Istoria del Regno di Napoli", first published at Venice in 1539 and printed again in 1541, 1552 and 1613. He believed that the ship after which the order was named was the "<a href="Argo">Argo</a>" of Greek legend. José Micheli y Márquez, in his "Tesoro militar de cavallería", published at Madrid in 1642, embellished Collenuccio's connection. He stated that the order was dedicated to Saint <a href="Nicholas%20of%20Myra">Nicholas of Myra</a> and was known as the Order of the Argonauts of Saint Nicholas, adding that these medieval Argonauts, wearing the white <a href="Religious%20habit">habit</a>, gathered annually on <a href="Saint%20Nicholas%27%20Day">Saint Nicholas' Day</a> (6 December) for a feast in the <a href="cathedral%20of%20Bari">cathedral of Bari</a>, which was dedicated to Nicholas. Micheli y Márquez is the main source for most of the false information that has spread about the order. The actual habit of the order, according to its statutes, was red and green.

Additional companions named by L III 29:

Each member bore the title "Monsire" (French 83) or "Messire" (L III 29).

Gerhard Tschierschwitz

Gerhard Tschierschwitz (23 April 1920 – 17 January 1997) was a German tank commander and recipient of the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Gerhard Tschierschwitz had joined the Flak-Regiment "Hermann Göring" since the beginning of the war and would serve in this unit as it evolved. Not much is known about his career during most of this time, but it is known that at the beginning of the division's participation in the battles in East Prussia during October 1944 he was an Oberleutnant and company commander in the Fallschirm-Panzer-Regiment Hermann Göring. Equipped with Panthers, Tschierschwitz led his company in a flanking maneuver and captured the village of Wirballen. He then began a rampage behind Russian lines without any infantry support, eventually establishing contact with a friendly infantry division. By the end he and his company had destroyed 16 tanks, 16 anti-tank guns, 6 artillery pieces and 13 machine guns, in addition to killing approximately 300 Soviet soldiers. For these actions he was later awarded the Knight's Cross.

Tschierschwitz was eventually promoted to Hauptmann, and followed his division until the general surrender in 1945. He fell into Russian captivity and was eventually released in 1953.

Fjällmaraton

Fjällmaraton (Literally: "Mountain Marathon") is a <a href="Racing">long distance race</a>, considered the hardest and most important one-day mountain <a href="marathon">marathon</a> in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. The total route has a length of with a cumulative elevation gain of 2,100 meters and similar elevation loss. The race takes place between the <a href="mountain%20resort">mountain resort</a>s <a href="V%C3%A5l%C3%A5dalen">Vålådalen</a> and <a href="Trillevallen">Trillevallen</a> in <a href="%C3%85re%20Municipality">Åre Municipality</a>, <a href="J%C3%A4mtland%20County">Jämtland County</a> since 2005. Until 2012 the race was known by the name "Vértex Fjällmaraton", then "AXA Fjällmarathon" and from 2017 "KIA Fjällmarathon" depending on varying sponsors.

Over time additional races have been added to the original Fjällmaraton proper, currently:
In 2012-2014 "Ottfjället upp" was a vertical race to the peak of Ottfjället, but this was replaced by "Vertical K" to the peak of <a href="%C3%85reskutan">Åreskutan</a> in 2015.

Winners.
The course has changed over time in different ways so course records are not listed here. The fastest male winning times have been under 3 hours 30 minutes and female winning times just over 4 hours, so considerably slower than a normal asphalt marathon race.

<a href="Andreas%20Svanebo">Andreas Svanebo</a> has won the race six times in seven starts. On the women's side, <a href="Emelie%20Forsberg">Emelie Forsberg</a> and <a href="Ida%20Nilsson">Ida Nilsson</a> have each won three times in three starts. Forsberg's first win in 2009 is widely cited, including on <a href="CNN">CNN</a>. She had borrowed a backpack from a friend and brought a chocolate mud cake that she had baked. Before the last big ascent, she stopped for 20 minutes and ate the cake, got new energy and won the race. Two years later she was back, did not stop to eat en route and improved her time by 30 minutes. In 2014 the by then established world class runner Forsberg was back again and improved her time by another 30 minutes.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Oberleutnant Kraus received the Knight's Cross following the battles in East Prussia in October 1944. At the time of the fighting he was a leader in 2./Fallschirm-Panzer-Regiment "Hermann Göring", a tank company equipped with Panthers. He and his tanks tore a gap in the advancing Soviet forces and participated in a meeting engagement with Russian armour in the village of Kassuben. A total of 14 tanks were encountered of which all of them were destroyed. He then held the village against further heavy attacks, despite being threatened with encirclement. Following three days of fighting, by October 22nd Kraus's company had been credited with the destruction of about 40 tanks, 30 anti-tank guns and a battalion of infantry. It was for this defensive success that he was later awarded the Knight's Cross.

Cora Millet-Robinet

Cora Millet-Robinet (28 November 1798–7 December 1890) was a French agricultural innovator and silk producer. She was the author of a highly popular handbook of farming, household management and cookery, known in English as "The French Country Housewife".

Her father and mother, both French in origin, had farmed in the French Caribbean colony of <a href="Saint-Domingue">Saint-Domingue</a>, which had become the independent state of <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>. Dispossessed as a result of the Haitian revolution, they moved to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> where Cora Robinet, their first daughter, was born. Nothing is known of her childhood or education. In 1823 she married her mother's brother, lieutenant-colonel François Millet who, likewise born in Saint-Domingue, had recently been widowed and had come to live with his sister's family in Paris. He also owned a château and farm in <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a>, La Cataudière in the commune of <a href="Availles-en-Ch%C3%A2tellerault">Availles-en-Châtellerault</a> (département of <a href="Vienne">Vienne</a>). After their marriage he and Cora took up farming there, eagerly experimenting with the latest scientific methods. In 1832 they were joined by Stéphane Robinet, Cora's elder brother, a well known chemist. All three took a special interest in silkworm farming and the production of silk, an industry which was then rapidly expanding in France.

Of these three Cora was the one who wrote, both for a scientific readership and for the general public. Her first book, in 1841, offered "Advice to young women on their life and their motherly duties when nursing children". In the same year she published the first of a series of "reports on the farming of silkworms ... by Messrs Millet and Robinet and Mme Millet" (her husband, her brother and herself). Her popular books focus on children, on women's education, and on the work typically done by 19th century farmers' wives: the kitchen and household, the management of servants, the <a href="farmyard">farmyard</a> or "basse-cour" with its poultry, the keeping of pigeons and rabbits. The most famous of all her books, "Maison rustique des dames" or "The French Country Housewife", first published in two volumes in 1844/1845, is an encyclopedia of cookery, the country household, and many aspects of farming. Regularly updated, this work remained in print for a hundred years: the 21st edition appeared in 1944.
In 1847/1849 François and Cora sold "La Cataudière" and bought the partly ruined Domaine de Pont near <a href="Genill%C3%A9">Genillé</a>, which they restored and extended. François died in 1860. At some date after that Cora went to live at a smaller property, La Berlonnière, at <a href="Saint-Beno%C3%AEt%2C%20Vienne">Saint-Benoît</a>, probably easier for her to manage alone and close to <a href="Poitiers">Poitiers</a> where she had contacts with publishers and was an honorary member of the Poitiers Society for Agriculture, Sciences and Arts. She was also a corresponding member of two French agricultural societies and of the Royal Academy of Agriculture in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>. In 1884, at the age of eighty-five, she was one of the first two women to be honoured with the title Knight of the Order of Agricultural Merit.

<doc id="54801001" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54801001" title="1,4-Butane sultone">
1,4-Butane sultone

1,4-butane sultone is a six-membered δ-<a href="sultone">sultone</a> and the cyclic ester of <a href="4-hydroxybutanesulfonic%20acid">4-hydroxybutanesulfonic acid</a>. As a <a href="Alkylation">sulfo-alkylating agent</a>, 1,4-butanesultone is used to introduce the sulfobutyl group (–(CH)–SO) into hydrophobic compounds posessing <a href="Nucleophile">nucleophilic</a> functional groups, for example <a href="Hydroxy%20group">hydroxy groups</a> (as in the case of <a href="%CE%B2-cyclodextrin">β-cyclodextrin</a>) or <a href="Amino%20group">amino groups</a> (as in the case of <a href="polymethine%20dyes">polymethine dyes</a>). In such, the sulfobutyl group is present as neutral sodium salt and considerably increases the water solubility of the derivatives.

Preparation.
A lab scale synthesis of 1,4-butanesultone starts from 4,4'-dichlorodibutyl ether (accessible from <a href="tetrahydrofuran">tetrahydrofuran</a> treated with <a href="phosphorus%20oxychloride">phosphorus oxychloride</a> and <a href="Sulfuric%20acid">concentrated sulfuric acid</a>), which reacts with sodium sulfite forming the corresponding 4,4'-butanedisulfonic disodium salt. By passing it through an acidic ion exchanger, the disodium salt is converted into the disulphonic acid which forms two molecules of 1,4-butanesultone at elevated temperature and reduced pressure under elimination of water. The yields obtained range from 72 to 80%.

Starting from 4-chlorobutan-1-ol (from tetrahydrofuran and <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">hydrogen chloride</a> in 54 to 57% yield), the sodium salt of 4-hydroxybutan-1-sulfonic acid is obtained with sodium sulfite. This salt is converted with strong acids (such as hydrochloric acid) into the very <a href="Hygroscopy">hygroscopic</a> 4-hydroxybutanesulfonic acid and cyclized to 1,4-butanesultone under elimination of water.

The cyclization of 4-hydroxybutanesulfonic acid in aqueous solution proceeds particularly efficiently when heated with high-boiling, water-immiscible solvents (for example <a href="1%2C2-Dichlorobenzene">1,2-dichlorobenzene</a> or <a href="Diethylbenzenes">diethylbenzene</a>, both boiling at about 180 °C) in which 1,4-butane-sultone dissolves and is thereby protected from hydrolysis in the aqueous medium. 1,4-butanesultone is obtained in yields of up to 99% upon reflux within one hour.

The vacuum distillation of the sodium salt of 4-hydroxybutanesulfonic acid leads in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid directly to 1,4-butanesultone. The sodium salt of 4-chlorobutane-1-sulfonic acid, which is obtained from <a href="1%2C4-dichlorobutane">1,4-dichlorobutane</a> with sodium sulfite, can also be cyclized to 1,4-butanesultone by heating to 180-250 °C.

The <a href="free-radical">free-radical</a> initiated <a href="sulfochlorination">sulfochlorination</a> of 1-chlorobutane leads to a mixture of positionally <a href="Isomer">isomeric</a> sulfochlorides and chlorination products and is therefore not suitable for the direct preparation of 1,4-butanesultone.

Properties.
1,4-butanesultone is a viscous, clear, colorless and odorless liquid which reacts in boiling water (to 4-hydroxybutanesulfonic acid) and alcohols (to 4-alkoxybutanesulfonic acid) and dissolves in many organic solvents. At temperatures below the melting point, the compound crystallizes giving "large, magnificent plates". [3] Compared to the homologous γ-sultone 1,3-propanesultone, 1,4-butanesultone is significantly less reactive as alkylating agent, but classified as <a href="Mutagen">mutagenic</a> and <a href="Carcinogen">carcinogenic</a>.

Applications.
Sulfobetaines.
1,4-butanesultone reacts smoothly with <a href="Nucleophile">nucleophiles</a> such as <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> to form the corresponding zwitterionic, usually very water-soluble sulfobutylbetaines.

Sulfobetaines with longer alkyl chains (CH mit n > 10) show interesting properties as surface-active compounds (<a href="Surfactant">surfactants</a>, <a href="Detergent">detergents</a>) with antimicrobial properties.

In the reaction of "N"-"N"-butylimidazole with 1,4-Butansultone in <a href="Toluene">Toluene</a> in a 98% yield is formed 1-butylimidazolium-3-(n-butylsulfonate)

1-Butylimidazolium-3-(n-butylsulfonate) catalyses as a component of multifunctional catalysts the reaction of platform chemicals from biomass (for example levulinic acid or itaconic acid) into the corresponding lactones, diols or cyclic ethers.

Aminoalkylphosphonic acids (such as aminomethane diphosphonic acid, accessible from phosphorus trichloride, formamide and phosphonic acid) form with 1,4-butanesultone N-(sulfobutyl)aminomethane diphosphonic acids:

N-(sulfobutyl)aminomethane diphosphonic acid is characterized by very high water solubility (< 1000 g·l) and a strong capability as <a href="complexing%20agent">complexing agent</a> and <a href="water%20softener">water softener</a>.

Sulfobutylation of <a href="Cyanine%20dye">cyanine dyes</a> leads to readily water-soluble compounds which react with proteins like <a href="Antibody">antibodies</a> and can be used as pH-sensitive fluorescence markers.

Ionic liquids.
The <a href="ionic%20liquid">ionic liquid</a> 4-triethylammonium butane-1-sulfonic acid hydrogensulfate (TEBSA HSO4) is formed by the reaction of 1,4-butanesultone with <a href="triethylamine">triethylamine</a> in <a href="acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a> to the <a href="zwitterion">zwitterion</a> (85% yield) and subsequent reaction with concentrated sulfuric acid.

4-triethylammonium butane-1-sulfonic acid hydrogensulfate can replace conventional <a href="Mineral%20acid">mineral acids</a> as effective and easily recyclable acid catalyst in solvent-free reactions.

The ring opening of 1,4-butanesultone with organic chloride salts yields ionic liquids of the 4-chlorobutylsulfonate type in quantitative yield.

The chlorine atom in the 4-chlorobutylsulfonate anion can be substituted by heating with inorganic (e.g. <a href="potassium%20fluoride">potassium fluoride</a>) or organic salts (e.g. <a href="sodium%20acetate">sodium acetate</a>) by the respective anion.

Sulfobutylated β-cyclodextrin.
Already in 1949 the reaction of 1,4-butanesultone with the water-insoluble <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a> <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> in <a href="sodium%20hydroxide%20solution">sodium hydroxide solution</a> was reported, which leads to a water-soluble product. Derived from this the derivatization of <a href="%CE%B2-cyclodextrin">β-cyclodextrin</a> to sulfobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBECD) is by now an important application of 1,4-butanesultone. Sulfobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin is a water-soluble <a href="inclusion%20compound">inclusion compound</a> for the <a href="solubilization">solubilization</a> and stabilization of sparsely water-soluble and chemically instable components. β-Cyclodextrin can be reacted with 1,4-butanesultone in sodium hydroxide solution at 70 °C to the sulfobutyl ether in yields of up to 80% and a degree of substitution of 6.68.

Thereby, the water solubility of the β-cyclodextrin increases from 18.5 g · l-1 to more than 900 g · l-1 at 25 ° C. Sulfobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin also finds a wide range of applications as an inert vehicle for drug delivery (the drugs transport and release).

Google's Ideological Echo Chamber

"Google's Ideological Echo Chamber", also known as the Google memo, originated as an internal memo, dated July 2017, by US-based <a href="Google">Google</a> engineer James Damore about Google's <a href="workplace%20diversity">diversity policies</a>. Damore argued that Google had shut down the conversation about diversity, and that Google has engaged in legally doubtful discriminative policies to increase diversity, Damore also posited that "the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership..." and suggested alternative methods to increase diversity. Google CEO <a href="Sundar%20Pichai">Sundar Pichai</a> responded by saying that parts of the memo "[advanced] harmful gender stereotypes", and fired Damore for allegedly violating the company's <a href="code%20of%20conduct">code of conduct</a>.

The memo and Google's subsequent dismissal of Damore were widely discussed in the media.

Course of events.
James Damore became motivated to write a memo after attending an "unrecorded" Google diversity program, whose rhetoric he described as largely "shaming and 'no, you can't say that, that's sexist'". He characterized this as an almost <a href="cult">cult</a>-like work environment in which dissenting opinions could not be voiced. After trying to discuss the issue with peers and being mostly ignored, Damore wrote the memo while on a flight to China.

The memo proposed that Google's approach to diversity was formed by political bias to the point where their policies were unable to be questioned. Calling the culture an "ideological echo chamber", the memo asserted that while discrimination exists, it was "extreme" to fully attribute under-representation of women in technical and leadership roles to oppression, and that it was "authoritarian" to correct for this with <a href="reverse%20discrimination">reverse discrimination</a>. Instead, it argued that the gender disparity could be partially explained by biological differences between women and men. According to Damore, those differences include women generally having a stronger interest in <a href="Empathizing-systemizing%20theory">people rather than things</a>, that women tend to be more social, more artistic, and are more prone to <a href="neuroticism">neuroticism</a> (higher <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a>, lower <a href="distress%20tolerance">stress tolerance</a>). The memorandum also listed multiple suggestions on ways to use those differences in order to increase women's representation in tech without resorting to discrimination.

The memo was dated July 2017 and originally shared on an internal <a href="electronic%20mailing%20list">mailing list</a>. It was later updated to begin with a paragraph affirming the author's opposition to workplace sexism and the use of stereotypes. On August 5, the memo was published by <a href="Gizmodo">Gizmodo</a>, initially with charts and hyperlinks removed from the citations backing up its argumentation. The memo's publication resulted in a controversy across social media, and public criticism of the memo and its author from several Google employees. According to "Wired", Google's internal forums showed "plenty of support" for Damore, who said he received private thanks from employees who were afraid to come forward.

Damore was fired by Google on August 7, 2017. The same day, prior to being fired, Damore filed a complaint with the <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Board">National Labor Relations Board</a> "(case # <a href="https%3A//nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-203891">32-CA-203891</a>)". The complaint is marked as "8(a)(1) Coercive Statements (Threats, Promises of Benefits, etc.)". A subsequent statement from Google asserted that its executives were unaware of the complaint when they fired Damore, as it is illegal to fire an employee in retaliation of a NLRB complaint. On the same day, Damore announced his intention to pursue legal action.

Google's VP of Diversity, Danielle Brown, responded to the memo on August 8: "Part of building an open, inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views, including different political views, feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws". Google's CEO <a href="Sundar%20Pichai">Sundar Pichai</a> wrote a note to Google employees, supporting Brown's formal response, and adding that many of the contents of the documents were fair to debate. His explanation read "to suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK... At the same time, there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat, and that is also not OK." Unauthorized ads criticising Pichai and Google for the firing were put up shortly after.

<a href="Gab%20%28social%20network%29">Gab</a>, a self-described pro-free speech platform, offered Damore a job immediately and <a href="Julian%20Assange">Julian Assange</a> offered him a job with <a href="WikiLeaks">WikiLeaks</a>.

Damore soon gave interviews to "<a href="Bloomberg%20Technology">Bloomberg Technology</a>", Canadian professor <a href="Jordan%20Peterson">Jordan Peterson</a>, and the alt-right's <a href="Stefan%20Molyneux">Stefan Molyneux</a>. He wrote an op-ed in the "Wall Street Journal", detailing the history of the memo and Google's reaction, followed by interviews for <a href="Reason_%28magazine%29">Reason</a>, <a href="Reddit%23IAmA_and_AMA">Reddit IAMA</a>, <a href="CNBC">CNBC</a> and <a href="Ben%20Shapiro">Ben Shapiro</a>.. 

Google's CEO planned a town hall meeting fielding questions from employees on inclusion. The meeting was cancelled a short time before due to safety concerns because questions submitted in advance began to appear on <a href="Breitbart%20News">Breitbart News</a> and other right wing websites along with the names of their authors. Danielle Brown, Google's VP for diversity, was harassed online and temporarily disabled her <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account.

Reactions.
Scientific views.
<a href="David%20P.%20Schmitt">David P. Schmitt</a>, Professor in Bradley University who founded the International Sexuality Description Project (ISDP), said that "in my view, claiming that sex differences exist in negative emotionality is not an 'incorrect assumption about gender.' It is an empirically well-supported claim," but that such differences were "unlikely to be all that relevant to the Google workplace", and were "not very large". He also wrote, "Using someone's biological sex to essentialize an entire group of people's personality is like surgically operating with an axe. Not precise enough to do much good, probably will cause a lot of harm. Moreover, men are more emotional than women in certain ways, too. Sex differences in emotion depend on the type of emotion, how it is measured, where it is expressed, when it is expressed, and lots of other contextual factors. How this all fits into the Google workplace is unclear to me." He finishes his article by saying, "Apparently at Google, internal discussion boards intended for open conversations about diversity and science-based thinking are not the right context for discussing evidence about psychological sex differences." 

<a href="Geoffrey%20Miller%20%28psychologist%29">Geoffrey Miller</a>, a professor in <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary psychology</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Mexico">University of New Mexico</a>, said that Damore got "most of the science right" and showed "pretty good judgment about what we know and what we don't know". However, he also said that "given that ... the sexes have such intricately complementary quirks, it may often be sensible, in purely practical business terms, to aim for more equal sex ratios in many corporate teams, projects, and divisions".

Gina Rippon, chair of cognitive <a href="brain%20imaging">brain imaging</a> at <a href="Aston%20University">Aston University</a>, disagreed with Miller's assessment, saying: "The key thing for me is that he's got quite a lot of the science wrong."

<a href="Peter%20Singer">Peter Singer</a>, Professor of Bioethics at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, stated of Damore's content that there are "serious articles, published in leading peer-reviewed scientific journals, supporting it", but, "there are also grounds for questioning some of this research". Regarding Google firing of Damore, Singer stated "it isn't necessary to decide which side is right, but only whether Damore's view is one that a Google employee should be permitted to express. I think it is."

Debra Soh, a sexual <a href="neuroscientist">neuroscientist</a> at <a href="York%20University">York University</a> in Toronto who writes about gender science, called the memo "fair and factually accurate", and said that scientific studies "have confirmed sex differences in the brain that lead to differences in our interests and behaviour". Prenatal testosterone, she said, was correlated with "a preference for mechanically interesting things and occupations in adulthood" which explains the higher percentage of men in technology-related fields.

<a href="Jonathan%20Haidt">Jonathan Haidt</a>, of <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, and Sean Stevens, of the <a href="Heterodox%20Academy">Heterodox Academy</a>, compiled a comprehensive list of the peer-reviewed meta-analyses on the subject and concluded that studies support Damore's claims that genders exhibit different traits, but that it was "extremely important" to distinguish between interest/enjoyment, versus ability. They added that this conclusion does not deny that bias, harassment, and discouragement exist in Silicon Valley and contribute to outcome disparities. 

<a href="Lee%20Jussim">Lee Jussim</a>, a professor of social psychology at <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a>, wrote in <a href="Quillette">Quillette</a> that "The author of the Google essay on issues related to diversity gets nearly all of the science and its implications exactly right", among them: "neither the left nor the right gets diversity completely right" and that there exists an "authoritarian and repressive atmosphere" around discussion of the topic.

<a href="Jordan%20Peterson">Jordan Peterson</a>, Professor of Psychology at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a>, who interviewed Damore said his points were supported by scientific evidence and his memo was "certainly not an anti-diversity screed".

<a href="Adam%20Grant">Adam Grant</a>, an organizational psychologist at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, wrote a response to the Google memo called "Differences between men and women are vastly exaggerated". <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> executive <a href="Sheryl%20Sandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a> helped to circulate it in a post that named "cultural stereotypes" as the cause of gender disparity. The blogger "Slate Star Codex" has published a detailed critique of Grant's arguments, to which Grant replied in the comment section of the critique.

<a href="Rosalind%20Barnett">Rosalind Barnett</a>, a psychologist at <a href="Brandeis%20University">Brandeis University</a>, coauthored an essay with <a href="Caryl%20Rivers">Caryl Rivers</a> which argued that "much of the data that Damore provides in his memo is suspect, outdated or has other problems". They listed studies which contradicted the ones cited by Damore and identified non-biological factors to account for the gap in stress levels between women and men.

Cynthia Lee, a <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> lecturer at <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> stated that "regardless of whether biological differences exist, there is no shortage of glaring evidence, in individual stories and in scientific studies, that women in tech experience bias and a general lack of a welcoming environment, as do underrepresented minorities". She argued that the scientific evidence on biological differences was a <a href="red%20herring">red herring</a> because correcting those bias problems is more urgent than, and clouds the study of, whether biological differences might account for a proportion of the numerical imbalances in Google and in technology.

Evolutionary biologist Suzanne Sadedin, most recently at <a href="KU%20Leuven">KU Leuven</a>, criticised the memo. She argued that it draws its reasoning and conclusion from an outdated and discredited <a href="Nature%20versus%20nurture">nature versus nurture dichotomy</a> instead of "the current state of the research on sex differences, which is based on <a href="neuroscience">neuroscience</a>, <a href="epigenetics">epigenetics</a> and <a href="developmental%20biology">developmental biology</a>." She said that predictions from evolutionary psychology, on the other hand, have had precedents for being dubious. She called into question the legitimacy of early reactions from psychologists who "happen to be on the political fringe, creating a compelling illusion of consensus, when the mainstream scientific view is miles away".

Employment law and free speech concerns.
<a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Hastings">UC Hastings</a> legal scholar <a href="Joan%20C.%20Williams">Joan C. Williams</a> expressed concerns about prescriptive language used by some diversity training programs. Noting that engineers like Damore can be "a particularly intransigent group when it comes to addressing attitudes and feelings", she recommended that diversity initiatives be phrased in problem solving terms.

Yuki Noguchi, a reporter for <a href="NPR">NPR</a>, said that Damore's firing has raised questions regarding the limits of <a href="free%20speech">free speech</a> in the workplace. <a href="First%20Amendment">First Amendment</a> free speech protections usually do not extend into the workplace, as the First Amendment restricts government action but not the actions of private employers, and employers have a duty to protect their employees against a hostile work environment. Lack of free speech protection in the workplace was cited as creating a possible <a href="chilling%20effect">chilling effect</a>.

Several <a href="employment%20law">employment law</a> experts noted that while Damore could challenge his firing in court, his potential case would be weak and Google would arguably have several defensible reasons for firing him; had Google not made a substantive response to his memo, that could have been cited as evidence of a "hostile work environment" in lawsuits against Google. Additionally, the memo could indicate that Damore would be unable to fairly assess or supervise the work of female colleagues.

However, an expert in Californian labor law, Valerie Sharpe, a labor lawyer based in the San Francisco area, said to "<a href="Business%20Insider">Business Insider</a>" that Damore could win the case and his chance is "above decent". When discussing with Bloomberg the viability of James Damore's potential claims before the National Labor Relations Board, the former Chair of the NLRB under President Barack Obama, Wilma Liebman, stated, "I think it's an open question. It's not a slam dunk either way."

Others.
<a href="Cathy%20Young">Cathy Young</a> in "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" argued that the memo "had [legitimate] points on gender" but that it probably overstates things, while Google's reaction to the memo was harmful since it "[lent] credence to complaints in the modern workplace, [that] men are the beleaguered sex". <a href="Margaret%20Wente">Margaret Wente</a> in "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" assessed that "the tone, although occasionally injudicious, was mild" and opined that Damore was fired because "in the world of liberal dogma, all of this is wrongthink". <a href="Erick%20Erickson">Erick Erickson</a>, a conservative writer for <a href="RedState">RedState</a>, criticized Google's decision to fire Damore, writing that it showed that "views outside left-wing groupthink are not shareable inside Google". Libertarian author <a href="Megan%20McArdle">Megan McArdle</a> wrote for "<a href="Bloomberg%20View">Bloomberg View</a>" that she agreed with Damore's claims about differing levels of interest between the sexes. Specifically, she recalled leaving a technology consulting job in her past because she felt male coworkers were more passionate about the subject than she was. CNN's <a href="Kirsten%20Powers">Kirsten Powers</a> stated that the memo, although flawed, "bears no relation to the hysterical, biased media coverage of it". <a href="David%20Brooks%20%28political%20commentator%29">David Brooks</a> of the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>", who wrote that the media's "coverage of the memo has been atrocious," criticized Google's handling of the controversy. He called for Sundar Pichai to resign as CEO, suggesting "either Pichai is unprepared to understand the research (unlikely), is not capable of handling complex data flows (a bad trait in a C.E.O.) or was simply too afraid to stand up to a mob," and called Danielle Brown's response "ideology obliterating reason." In an opinion piece for "Bloomberg View", <a href="Clive%20Crook">Clive Crook</a> accused Sundar Pichai of adopting a <a href="strawman%20fallacy">strawman fallacy</a> and wrote that Danielle Brown's decision to denounce the memo without linking to it was "a formula straight out of the Soviet thought-control handbook." 

Science journalist <a href="Angela%20Saini">Angela Saini</a> wrote in <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> that the memo reflected common misconceptions about the <a href="Sex%20differences%20in%20humans">biological differences between men and women</a>, and demonstrated a flawed understanding of the research it cited. <a href="Owen%20Jones%20%28writer%29">Owen Jones</a> named the memo "guff dressed up with pseudo-scientific jargon: not just belittling women, but reducing men to the status of unemotional individualistic robots." His article referenced a widely quoted <a href="Medium%20%28website%29">Medium</a> post by former Google employee Yonatan Zunger who accused Damore of failing to grasp the desired qualities of an engineer. Steve Kovach, in "<a href="Business%20Insider">Business Insider</a>" interviewed a female Google employee who said "To have us all lumped into one sort of category like that and to have such a baseless claim made about who we are, and to have it positioned as fact—as scientific fact—I don't know how we could feel anything but attacked by that." "<a href="Business%20Insider">Business Insider</a>" also reported an increase in the number of women preparing to leave Google by interviewing for other jobs. Reporter Oliver Staley focused on the claim in the memo that "men are more competitive than women" for innate biological reasons. In an article for "<a href="Quartz%20%28publication%29">Quartz</a>", he pointed to a 2009 economics study which found evidence against this. <a href="Kara%20Swisher">Kara Swisher</a> of "<a href="Recode">Recode</a>" said that the memo, after the first paragraph, was "sexist twaddle, wrapped in the undeserved protection of free speech". She chose not to name Damore, fearing that he would be targeted online. Christina Cauterucci of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" magazine drew parallels between arguments from Damore's memo and those of <a href="men%27s%20rights%20activist">men's rights activist</a>s. <a href="Laurie%20Leshin">Laurie Leshin</a>, president of the <a href="Worcester%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>, criticized the memo as displaying a pervasive and harmful bias. She wrote "the overwhelmingly negative response it has received gives me hope that we are moving the needle".

In addition to <a href="Sheryl%20Sandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a> who <a href="%23Scientific%20views">linked to scientific counterarguments</a>, a number of other women in technology condemned the memorandum. <a href="Megan%20Smith">Megan Smith</a>, a former Google vice president, said of Damore's memo "It's so offensive to see what this young man was writing, but it's helpful to see it in the public..." and characterized Damore's statements as "insidious" and that in reading his memo, "...women of all races, men of color, experience what I call <a href="death%20by%20a%20thousand%20cuts">death by a thousand paper cuts</a>". <a href="Susan%20Wojcicki">Susan Wojcicki</a>, CEO of <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>, wrote an editorial in which she described feeling devastated about the potential effect of the memo on young women. It began with a quotation from her daughter, asking if there are "biological reasons why there are fewer women in tech and leadership?"

A survey by Blind, an anonymous corporate chat app, found that 56% of Google employees surveyed disagreed with the decision to fire James Damore and 44% agreed with it. Other tech workers have shown similarly split views, depending on the company.

Several analyses focused more on reactions to the memo than on the memo itself. For example, Jesse Singal wrote "A memo can’t just be off-base or overly simplistic; its author has to be a reactionary monster, the embodiment of gender inequity in tech." When <a href="Eric%20Weinstein">Eric Weinstein</a> announced objection to the firing, <a href="Donna%20Harris%20%28businesswoman%29">Donna Harris</a> wrote about her experiences of sexual harassment, in response to his tweet which she felt downplayed the issue. In "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>", <a href="Conor%20Friedersdorf">Conor Friedersdorf</a> took issue with the commonly applied label "anti-diversity" and warned that "every prominent instance of journalism that proceeds with less than normal rigor when the subject touches on social justice feeds a growing national impulse to dismiss everything published about these subjects". Later, he published the viewpoint of English professor <a href="Alan%20Jacobs%20%28academic%29">Alan Jacobs</a>, opining that Sundar Pichai's reasons for firing Damore were ambiguous. A "Slate" article by physicist Chandra Prescod-Weinstein, which blamed the incident on flaws within science itself, was condemned by biologist <a href="Jerry%20Coyne">Jerry Coyne</a> and other commentators. <a href="Ezra%20Klein">Ezra Klein</a>, contributing to "<a href="Vox%20%28website%29">Vox</a>", suggested that the discussion following the Google memo validated a variety of fears held by people across the political spectrum; "If Google — and the tech world more generally — is sexist, or in the grips of a totalitarian cult of political correctness, or a secret hotbed of alt-right reactionaries, the consequences would be profound."

Comparative religion.
The <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> Scholars, <a href="Gaddala%20Solomon">G. Solomon</a>, <a href="Samavesam%20of%20Telugu%20Baptist%20Churches">STBC</a> (1957), G. Babu Rao, <a href="CBCNC">CBCNC</a> (1990) and Madanu Francis, <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20missionaries">RCM</a> (1998) have expounded the need for <a href="Comparative%20analysis">comparative analysis</a>, especially in building existential communities and relating to each other in a setting of <a href="Religion">religions</a> ("<a href="Sitz%20im%20Leben">Sitz im Leben</a>"). Yesurathnam's writings on <a href="Comparative%20religion">Comparative religion</a> could best be understood if one were to take a look at the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> Scholar, <a href="Gnana%20Robinson">Gnana Robinson's</a>, <a href="Church%20of%20South%20India">CSI</a> (1998) work promoting the cause of <a href="Interfaith%20dialogue">Interfaith dialogue</a> with special reference to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, 
<a href="Geoffrey%20Parrinder">Edward Geoffrey Parrinder</a> (1997) of <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20London">King's College, London</a> defined <a href="Avatara">Avatara</a> as "the manifestation of the divine in human form". Yesurathnam, also wrote on the work on the concept of <a href="Avatara">Avatara</a>, which has drawn the attention of Scholars and his works were quoted extensively by Research Scholars at the <a href="Universities">Universities</a> of <a href="University%20of%20London">London</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="England">England</a> by Bob Robinson (2004) who took note of the work of Yesurathnam on <a href="Avatara">Avatara</a> with special emphasis on <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and by Steven Tsoukalas (2007) who quoted Yesurathnam's work on the forms of <a href="Avatara">Avatara</a>.

Earlier proponents who experimented with <a href="Contextualization%20%28Bible%20translation%29">Contextualization</a>, emphasizing on the presentation of <a href="Christ">Christ</a> adapting to the <a href="Indian%20culture">Indian culture</a>, were <a href="Robert%20de%20Nobili">Robert de Nobili</a>, <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">SJ</a>, <a href="E.%20Stanley%20Jones">E. Stanley Jones</a>, <a href="Methodist%20Church%20in%20India">MCI</a>, and <a href="B.%20V.%20Subbamma">B. V.

<doc id="54801438" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54801438" title="Lefaucheux 1854">
Lefaucheux 1854

In 1854, Frenchman Eugene Lefaucheux introduced the Lefaucheux Model 1854, notable as being the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges rather than loose powder, pistol ball, and percussion caps. The 1854 model was a single-action, pinfire revolver holding six rounds. It was a French military revolver chambered for the 12 mm pinfire cartridge, based on a design by <a href="Casimir%20Lefaucheux">Casimir Lefaucheux</a> (his father, also a gun designer). The 1854 revolver spawned numerous variants, some of which were produced under license in other countries. It was widely exported during the 1860' and sold as both a military and civilian sidearm with either a short or long barrel. Most military models were produced only with single-action whereas civilian models were made primarily with double action.
Design.
The revolver was a six-shot open-framed design, which was loaded via a hinged gate on the right side of the frame, through which empty cartridges were also ejected via an <a href="ejector%20rod">ejector rod</a> running along the barrel.

History.
It was first fielded in the 1858 variation by the French Navy (designated as Lefaucheux de Marine mle 1858, or simply <a href="Lefaucheux%20M1858">Lefaucheux M1858</a>). The French Navy found the metallic cartridge to be useful at sea and in wet conditions, as pre-metallic paper cartridges suffered from moisture damage, often rendering them useless. 

The 1854 model and variants were exported to many nations. Italy was the largest customer; it purchased over 27,000 revolvers to arm the Royal <a href="Carabinieri">Carabinieri</a> and other state police organizations, as well as some naval elements. Norway received 800 units in June 1860, and 1,100 in March 1864. Versions with an octagonal barrel were ordered in April 1864 and received in May 1864; Norway then obtained a license to produce its own. Turkey ordered a small amount in September 1864. Romania received about 2,000 in December 1864. The Swedish navy made numerous orders, receiving at least 2,130 units by February 1864, and continuing to order through 1866. Greece received 200 units in April 1861. Japan made two orders by 1862, but the amounts are unknown. The United States' Union Army and the Confederate States Army both ordered and received over 12,000 revolvers by January 1862.

Variants.
There is often confusion about the Lefaucheux 1854 and 1858 models. The information in this entry refers to the 1854 and its variants made in France for others or made under license elsewhere. The 1854 was primarily in 12mm pinfire, but also made in a 7 mm version by Escoffier in 1858 and patented with double action. A 9 mm version was designed in 1856 and available with either a rounded or an octogonal barrel. A version using center fire cartridges was eventually developed. Models were also purchased by Spain, Russia, Italy, and Norway and built under license. Spain was the first nation to do so, producing the 1858 'Officier' by 'Orbea Hermanos' at <a href="Eibar">Eibar</a> and <a href="Turbia">Turbia</a>. Spain later made an 1863 model, also under license. After buying several thousand from France, Italy began producing some of its own at the Glisenti company in <a href="Brescia">Brescia</a>.

Norway purchased a license in 1864 and designed their own model which was accepted by their military as the M/1864. It produced about 1700 copies at Kronborg Vapenfabrikk. In 1898, Norway converted their existing M/1864s to use center fire cartridges, designating the upgrade M/64/98. Norway's use of the Lefaucheux revolver was common up to 1920. In 1926, there were about 1371 models of all types in their inventory (1854, M/1864, and M/64/98); they were withdrawn from service in 1931.

The American Civil War.
Both the Confederate and Federal forces used Lefaucheux revolvers in the American Civil War. The Union Army typically issued them to cavalry soldiers, especially in the states of Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Some of the models sold to the American powers kept the original designation, 1854, and were produced either at Lefaucheux Paris, Liege, Belgium, or local producers under license (Chollet, Merton, Merton via Bond, Gunther at Liege). However, these pinfire revolvers were replaced in service later in the war as more Colt and Remington revolvers became available. Among American troops, the weapon was often referred to as the "French Tranter".

After the war many were sold back to France, as it had entered the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 and needed weapons. About 6,780 of the original 12,000 revolvers or so shipped to America were returned to France.

Bardia Rahim

Bardia Rahim (born July 24, 1975) is an Iranian-American businessman, serial entrepreneur, and internet personality. Rahim has been featured on nearly every major national news network for his trademark infringement lawsuit against <a href="Kim%20Kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> for her stake in the L.E.D <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> case, LuMee.

Early life and hardship.
Bardia Rahim was born to a working class Iranian family in <a href="Tehran%2C%20Iran">Tehran, Iran</a> in 1975. In pursuit of business opportunities, the Rahim family left Iran for the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> in 1980. The Rahim family owned and operated a small produce delivery company in <a href="Escondido%2C%20California">Escondido, California</a>. Following a string of financial hardship and business foreclosure, Bardia's father abandoned the family to go back to Iran. He left his wife, and two children in the United States penniless and with a foreclosed home. Given the new financial standing of the Rahim family and the loss of the primary income earner, Bardia was forced to find work at the age of 15. Bardia eventually resorted to growing and selling <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a> in an effort to provide income for his family.

Incarceration.
Rahim's illegal growing venture expanded exponentially and at one point was earning him, "approximately $60,000 a week." His efforts also caught the eye of the <a href="Drug%20Enforcement%20Agency">Drug Enforcement Agency</a> (DEA). Rahim name was given to the DEA by a friend who was also a "grower," and had been arrested by the police. An 8-month investigation into Bardia took place that included surveillance and satellite tracking of his various whereabouts. In 2006, while on a trip to Hawaii for a friends wedding, the DEA agents stormed his hotel room and placed him under arrest. Prosecutors offered a plea agreement that included retention of all previously held properties and ownerships if he were to cooperate in further investigations against other, "growers." Bardia refused to take part in any plea deals because, "I wouldn’t rat someone else out, so I took five years in jail. I felt I needed to own up to my responsibilities." Rahim was sentenced to 5 years in prison for his cultivation of marijuana plants.
Rahim describes his 5 years in prison as an "experience that can make you or break you,” Bardia says, “You can go into prison and become a better criminal, you can get into drugs, or you can read books and educate yourself. I chose the latter. I took a lot of college courses." Rahim studied <a href="marketing">marketing</a> and business while in prison. After a particularly long stint where he was forced into solitary confinement for his involvement in a prison fight, Rahim began to complement his life and future. It was this isolation period where Rahim decided to make a drastic change once out of prison.

After Rahim's incarceration, his focus went towards building various companies from the ground. His main portfolio of companies which he stands as President is True Honor®, SnapLight®, and PotDrive™. His involvement in various companies and standing as a reformed citizen has led to him becoming an Instagram personality and motivational guru for his growing masses of followers on social media.

True Honor.
In 2008, <a href="https%3A//truehonor.com">True Honor</a> was founded as a lifestyle clothing brand that was based solely out of Rahim's car where he would sell pieces to friends and family. Rahim has been quoted as saying that True Honor is, "diverse, athletic, different, and meant to inspire." The brand eventually spawned into something much larger as a word of mouth campaign began to build the clothing line. Now, True Honor is a global brand with presence in hundreds of clothing stores globally. True Honor sponsored athletes include Professional Surfer, Sebastian Steudtner, Professional MMA Fighters, Paul “The Gentleman” Bradley and Felice Herrig, and UFC Veterans Jason Lambert and Fabricio Camoes.

SnapLight.
In 2013, while on a trip to Las Vegas, Rahim noticed a celebrity being asked to take pictures with some fans. Due to bad lighting, people were forced to resort to pictures with the celebrity from the bathroom. Thus, the idea of <a href="https%3A//www.snaplightcase.com">SnapLight</a> was born. Rahim began to work on the technology but soon discovered that a previously unknown person by the name of Hooshmand Harooni maintained the patent for the iPhone case. In early 2017, Rahim was able to attain the licensing rights for Harooni's patent in early 2017.

PotDrive.
In 2017, Rahim founded <a href="https%3A//www.potdrive.com">PotDrive</a>, a directory used to connect the global cannabis community in one marketplace meant to connect Marijuana businesses with consumers. The PotDrive App is available as a free download for iOS and Android and is meant to connect all facets of the cannabis industry into one streamlined marketplace.

Kardashian and LuMee legal Issues.
In 2017, a lawsuit was filed against LuMee and Kardashian's company, Kimsaprincess Inc. for infringing on the original licensed patent. Rahim has claimed that LuMee and their sponsors bullied SnapLight out of prospective markets and forced <a href="GoDaddy">GoDaddy</a> to shut down their website on Black Friday. Rahim stated that this was a "death sentence" for SnapLight. LuMee responded by saying that “the lawsuit has no merit and Kim has done nothing wrong. LuMee is an innovator of illuminated cell phone cases and was the first to market. Between its patents, copyrights and trademarks, LuMee has developed substantial intellectual property rights surrounding its product line.” Rahim's $100 Million lawsuit made national news for his lawsuit and was featured on outlets including, Fox, CNN, PEOPLE Magazine, BBC, and TMZ.

Personal.
Rahim currently resides in <a href="San%20Marcos%2C%20CA">San Marcos, CA</a> where he is currently working on a memoir following his time in prison. His hobbies include <a href="Jiu-Jitsu">Jiu-Jitsu</a> of which he earned a black belt in 2014.<a href="https%3A//truehonor.com/true-honor-founder-recieves-black-belt/">/</a>

Helen Peterson

Helen Peterson (native name: Wa-Cinn-Ya-Win-Pi-Mi, August 3, 1915-July 10, 2000) was a <a href="Cheyenne">Cheyenne</a>-<a href="Lakota%20people">Lakota</a> activist and lobbyist. She was the first director of the Denver Commission on Human Relations. She was the second Native American woman to become director of the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20American%20Indians">National Congress of American Indians</a> at a time when the government wanted to discharge their treaty obligations to the tribes by eliminating their tribal governments through the <a href="Indian%20termination%20policy">Indian termination policy</a> and forcing the tribe members to <a href="Cultural%20assimilation%20of%20Native%20Americans">assimilate</a> into the mainstream culture. She authored a resolution on Native American education, which was ratified at the second Inter-American Indian Conference, held in <a href="Cuzco%2C%20Peru">Cuzco, Peru</a>. She created a model program for summer school programs on ethnic studies, which was used throughout the United States. In 1986, Peterson was inducted into the <a href="Colorado%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Colorado Women's Hall of Fame</a> and the following year, her papers were donated to the <a href="Smithsonian">Smithsonian</a>'s <a href="National%20Anthropological%20Archives">National Anthropological Archives</a>.

Early life.
Helen Louise White was born on August 3 1915 on the <a href="Pine%20Ridge%20Indian%20Reservation">Pine Ridge Indian Reservation</a> in <a href="Bennett%20County%2C%20South%20Dakota">Bennett County, South Dakota</a> to Lucy (née Henderson) and Robert B. White. She was given the native name Wa-Cinn-Ya-Win-Pi-Mi, meaning "woman to trust and depend on". The family lived in northern Nebraska and White attended <a href="Hay%20Springs%2C%20Nebraska">Hay Springs</a> High School, graduating in 1932. She went on to further her education at <a href="Chadron%20State%20College">Chadron State College</a>, studying business education. On August 29 1935, White married Richard F. Peterson in <a href="Garden%20County%2C%20Nebraska">Garden County, Nebraska</a> and she worked at the U.S. Land Use <a href="Resettlement%20Administration">Resettlement Administration</a> to pay their way through school. Richard enlisted in the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States%20during%20World%20War%20II">war effort</a> and Peterson had their only child, R. Max, soon after. In 1942, the couple divorced and Peterson moved with her mother to <a href="Denver">Denver</a>.

Career.
Peterson began work at the <a href="University%20of%20Denver">University of Denver</a> as the executive director of the Rocky Mountain Council of Inter-American Affairs. In 1948, she was hired by the newly elected mayor, <a href="J.%20Quigg%20Newton">J. Quigg Newton</a>, to work on the Commission on Community Telations. The mayor had a goal of desegregating the community and to do that, he needed voters willing to change the <a href="municipal%20charter">municipal charter</a>. Working with <a href="Bernie%20Valdez">Bernie Valdez</a>, Director of the Denver Welfare Department, Peterson attempted to build bridges between the established <a href="Latin%20American">Latin American</a> citizens and the new <a href="migrant%20farm%20workers">migrant farm workers</a> who had come to work on the <a href="beetroot">beetroot</a> farms. She went door to door in <a href="Hispanic">Hispanic</a> neighborhoods, registering voters and organizing the community. Peterson developed cultural programs and met with city leaders to provide lecture series on issues, such as fair labor and housing laws. At the end of the year, she was made the director of the Committee on Human Relations, the first person to hold the post. In that capacity, she led a drive to hire minority workers and assisted the mayor in passing anti-discriminatory employment and housing regulations. In 1949, she was asked to go to Peru as an advisor to the United States delegation attending the Second Inter-American Indian Conference. She authored a resolution to improve education for indigenous people, which was ratified by the conference.

In 1953, Peterson was urged by <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> to move to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.%20C.">Washington, D. C.</a> and help reorganize the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20American%20Indians">National Congress of American Indians</a> (NCAI). The organization, founded in 1944 to fight against the government's <a href="Indian%20termination%20policy">Indian termination policy</a> was in disarray, on the verge of bankruptcy, and was facing pressure from President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> for its dissolution. Because of Peterson's experience in organizing minority programs, she was able to slow the <a href="Cultural%20assimilation%20of%20Native%20Americans">assimilationist</a> aims of Congress and assist tribes in asserting their own <a href="sovereign%20right">sovereign right</a>s. Peterson was hired to replace Frank George, who had in turn replaced <a href="Ruth%20Muskrat%20Bronson">Ruth Muskrat Bronson</a> as executive director. 

Early in 1954, Peterson scheduled an emergency conference with tribal leaders to discuss termination. The meeting was the largest gathering of protest that had ever been assembled by American Indians, and was scheduled in response to the passage of <a href="House%20concurrent%20resolution%20108">House concurrent resolution 108</a>, which called for the end of federal responsibility for selected tribes, which were to be debated beginning on February 15, 1954. She and her mother prepared the materials for the conference on a hand cranked <a href="mimeograph%20machine">mimeograph machine</a> in her basement. Another bill was introduced that year to eliminate <a href="Competence%20%28law%29">competency</a> restrictions on land transactions and required Peterson to mobilize tribal leaders to wire their congressmen to defeat the bill. At issue was whether property patents would be assigned by <a href="Dawes%20Act">allotment</a> directly to tribal members who had no real knowledge of property values or laws governing transfer, or whether the deeds to allotted property were held in trust until allottees actually had an understanding of property ownership and fair market value. Her efforts in advancing Native Americans and fighting against discriminatory legislation was recognized by the <a href="American%20Indian%20Exposition">American Indian Exposition</a> of <a href="Anadarko%2C%20Oklahoma">Anadarko, Oklahoma</a>, which named her the "Outstanding Indian of 1955".

As NCAI made progress in slowing termination, Peterson helped develop new tactics to protect Native rights, such as creating a summer school program with <a href="D%27Arcy%20McNickle">D'Arcy McNickle</a> in 1956 for ethnic studies and convincing <a href="NBC">NBC</a> to air a program on the policy and its effect on the <a href="Klamath%20Tribes">Klamath Tribes</a> in 1957. In 1958, Peterson and NCAI president <a href="Joseph%20R.%20Garry">Joseph R. Garry</a> went to <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> to study the methods of <a href="Operation%20Bootstrap">Operation Bootstrap</a>, which had transformed the economic relationship between the island and the United States government. They were hopeful that the program could be mirrored for Native Americans to become self-sufficient, but legislators refused to act. In 1960, at the invitation of Sol Tax, an anthropologist, Peterson met with McNickle and John Rainer to prepare materials for a conference to be held in Chicago the following year. Largely drafted by McNickle the, "Declaration of Indian Purpose" for the 1961 American Indian Chicago Conference contained provisions for a reversal of the termination policy to be replaced by programs focused on development of economic, educational, social and legal nature. The declaration also called for the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to be replaced by a Commission of six members, half of whom were Native American, to evaluate issues effecting tribes. As the conference date neared in June 1961, factions emerged. Some felt that the organized NCAI operated more in the manner of a non-Indian reform association, rather than one that used traditional methods to address problems, whereas others felt that its focus did not adequately represent the issues of tribal identity and reservation realities. By August, the factionalism which had become apparent in planning the convention, created calls for restructuring the NCAI and Peterson resigned.

Returning to Denver in 1962, Peterson again took up the post as the director of the Commission on Community Relations. The <a href="Indian%20Relocation%20Act%20of%201956">Indian Relocation Act of 1956</a> caused a large influx of Native Americans to the Denver area, but Congress had failed to sufficiently fund the program. Peterson's office tried to fill the gap by providing social and employment services, as well as job training for Denver's Native American community. Though no longer employed at the NCAI, controversy continued and her replacement, Robert Burnette, accused both Peterson and Garry of mismanagement during their tenure. The dispute between Burnette and his supporters and Peterson and hers, continued through the 1960s dividing the NCAI membership. Burnette was forced out in 1964 and replaced by <a href="Vine%20Deloria%20Jr.">Vine Deloria Jr.</a>, who had the difficult task of trying to bring the organization back to financial stability and heal the factionalism. After eight years, of directing the Commission, Peterson accepted a position with the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> (BIA), working as a field liaison officer and coordinator with the <a href="United%20States%20Customs%20Service">United States Customs Service</a> in Denver. In 1971, she returned to Washington, D. C. and served as the assistant for the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In 1978, the BIA transferred her to serve as a tribal government services officer in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. Focusing on treaty obligations and Indian health, she worked to ensure that federal, state, local and tribal governments worked together in serving the American Indian community. She remained with the BIA until her retirement in 1985.

The year after her retirement, Peterson was inducted into the <a href="Colorado%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Colorado Women's Hall of Fame</a>. The following year, her papers were donated to the <a href="National%20Anthropological%20Archives">National Anthropological Archives</a> of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. When the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20American%20Indian">National Museum of the American Indian</a> Archive Center was created in 2007, her papers were transferred there. Upon her retirement, Peterson devoted her time to local and regional projects in and around Portland for the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a>. She remained an active member in the NCAI through the early 1990s, participating in the 1993 <a href="Albuquerque">Albuquerque</a> conference held at the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Mexico">University of New Mexico</a> on developing inter-tribal relationships.

Death and legacy.
Peterson died on July 10, 2000 in a nursing home in <a href="Vancouver%2C%20Washington">Vancouver, Washington</a>. Peterson is credited with having led NCAI to stop, or at least slow, the termination movement while she served as director of NCAI. The ethnic studies program that she and McNickle developed for <a href="Colorado%20College">Colorado College</a> between 1956 and 1970 became a model for universities throughout the United States.

Karl-Heinz Wallhäuser had been assigned command of a company of Jagdpanzer IV tank destroyers when his division was transferred to the Eastern front. During the first round of fighting, on 9 August, he created the preconditions for the establishment of a new defensive line by repelling Russian advances and launching spoiling attacks of his own. His greatest success was near Studziansk, where he counterattacked and captured a Russian-held village, destroying six tanks as well as several anti-tank and infantry positions. Two of these tanks were destroyed by Wallhäuser himself despite his gunner being put out of action.

In the fighting in East Prussia later on that year, on 26 October, Wallhäuser's tank destroyers engaged a major Russian tank force and was able to drive it back to its starting line, collecting stragglers along the way. When the neighbouring unit was forced to retreat he counterattacked into the Russians' flank, recapturing the position and inflicting approximately 300 casualties. This defensive success prevented a Russian breakthrough towards Gumbinnen, and Wallhäuser was later awarded the Knight's Cross for this action.

Ghosts &amp; the Law

Ghosts & the Law is a professorial inaugural lecture that was delivered by <a href="Joe%20Oloka-Onyango">Joe Oloka-Onyango</a>, a celebrated Professor of Law at <a href="Makerere%20University">Makerere University</a> School of Law, Uganda, on November 12, 2015, within the <a href="Makerere%20University">Makerere University</a> Main Hall. 

The lecture, grounded in <a href="Constitutional%20law">Constitutional law</a> and governance, was primarily an analysis of the journey and life of the <a href="Political%20question">Political Question Doctrine</a> (and its twin concept; <a href="Public%20interest%20law">Public Interest Litigation</a>) in Uganda's jurisprudence and legal-political development with due regard to impact on <a href="Constitutionalism">Constitutionalism</a>, the doctrine of <a href="Separation%20of%20powers">Separation of powers</a>, fundamental <a href="Human%20rights">Human rights</a>, <a href="Militarism">Militarism</a>, change of government, <a href="Democracy">democracy</a> and a host of other aspects; all through a 50 year time frame (1966 - 2015).

Overview.
Spanning over 70 pages in its written form, the lecture comprises 5 major sections and has its primary legal analysis built upon the pivotal judicial precedent of <a href="Uganda%20v%20Commissioner%20of%20Prisons%2C%20Ex%20Parte%20Matovu">Uganda v Commissioner of Prisons, Ex Parte Matovu</a>, which essentially introduced the Political Question Doctrine into Uganda's <a href="Corpus%20Juris">corpus juris</a>. <a href="Uganda%20v%20Commissioner%20of%20Prisons%2C%20Ex%20Parte%20Matovu">Ex parte Matovu</a> was decided in 1966 by the High Court of Uganda a little while after <a href="Milton%20Obote">Apollo Milton Obote</a> had seized all powers of government, suspended Uganda's 1962 Independence Constitution and paved way for the promulgation of a new 1966 Constitution and the passing of various "emergency powers laws" under which various government critics were irregularly arrested and detained.

"Ghosts & the Law" commences by exploring where and how ghosts are manifest within Literature and in Philosophy before tracing their presence in the law. An overview of ex parte Matovu is then given, ""explaining how and why the case became such a cause celebre of contemporary Ugandan jurisprudence"". Thereafter, an examination of the Political Question Doctrine and its twin aspect of Public Interest Litigation is undertaken before conclusively considering ""what the future holds"" for both ghosts in Uganda's context.

<a href="Joe%20Oloka-Onyango">Prof Oloka-Onyango</a> makes the unexpected stipulation that just as the phenomenon of <a href="Ghost">ghosts</a> can be found in and does 'haunt' popular mythology, socio-cultural beliefs, religion and other aspects of life, so it is with the law as well. The law too is haunted by ghosts that, in his words, "″come in many varied shapes and sizes″" such as; as the <a href="Common%20law">Common law</a> and its <a href="Precedent">doctrine of Precedent</a> and of course, the Political Question Doctrine which is embedded within the ghost that is "Uganda v Commissioner of Prisons, Ex Parte Matovu", or as it is more commonly expressed, the ghost of "ex parte Matovu" or simply the ghost of "Matovu".

"″Most people pretend not to believe in ghosts. But there is an abundance of literature on the phenomenon of ghosts for us to step back and question that belief. This is especially true of ghosts in the Law. How else would one describe the Doctrine of Precedent or Stare Decisis? It is the dogma which says an English case decided in 1820 can still determine the way a Ugandan court in 2015 will make its decision.″"

As is ordinarily characteristic of ghosts, ghosts in the law also possess an overbearing and domineering presence over 'reality', occasionally making their appearance to influence the Present and even the Future.
"Ghosts & the Law", focuses, in particular, on the ghost of ex parte Matovu and its effect on Ugandan jurisprudence and governance across the decades after it was decided. Prof Oloka-Onyango states that the precedent in ex parte Matovu embodies two ghosts: one oppressively negative and the other positively liberating; one backward-looking and the other forward-looking.
At a glance, the former ghost is that of the Political Question Doctrine and the latter is Public Interest Litigation. He expresses the view that ex parte Matovu begot both and therefore seeks to determine which of the two has prevailed over the years and which of them will in the end triumph.

"″But as with all spiritual beings—such as the Roman God, Janus—there are two sides to the case. In other words, there are not just one but (at least) two ghosts of ex parte Matovu. There is the backward-looking one which supported the extra-constitutional overthrow of government in 1966 and paved the way for military dictatorship, judicial restraint and conservatism. And in the same case, there is its reverse which “jettisoned formalism” to the winds, overruled legal “technicalities,” and underlined the need for the protection of fundamental human rights. The jettisoning formalism decision eventually opened the way to a robust and growing industry of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in Uganda.″"

In respect of Public Interest Litigation, Prof Oloka-Onyango says;

""Simply put, Public Interest Litigation (PIL) is the use of courts of law as a mechanism to challenge authoritarian structures of governance, structural conditions of oppression and domination and established frameworks of marginalization and exclusion. In contrast to the idea that certain issues should not be the subject of judicial intervention—the essence of the Political Question Doctrine (PQD)—Public Interest Litigation underscores the idea that law and politics are intertwined in such an intimate manner that to distinguish the two is to simply split hairs. Put simply, PIL is politics pursued through legal means and using the Judiciary as the main channel, especially when the traditional political avenues of reform and progressive transformation have been blocked.""

A brief overview of ex parte Matovu is given below.

Ex Parte Matovu; brief facts and holding.
The Applicant in this case, Michael Matovu, sought the prerogative writ of <a href="Habeas%20corpus">Habeas corpus</a> from the High Court of Uganda following his arrest and detention at <a href="Luzira%20Maximum%20Security%20Prison">Luzira Prison</a>. His application was however defective because it failed to properly name a respondent, lacked a motion paper and had errors within the affidavits presented. Nevertheless, the Court held that it would not dismiss the Applicant's action because of these errors in "formalism" since what was at stake was the "liberty of a citizen". It therefore, to quote a famous phrase within the judgment, "″decided to jettison formalism to the winds″" and hear the application in substance.
An important question arose as to which Constitution was the prevalent supreme law of Uganda; the 1962 Independence Constitution or the 1966 Constitution that arose after Apollo Milton Obote seized all powers of government and suspended the 1962 Constitution in what was essentially a coup d'etat?
It was put to the Court that validity of the 1966 Constitution was a Political Question which it was precluded from determining because of the Political Question Doctrine. Alternatively, the Court was referred to <a href="Hans%20Kelsen">Hans Kelsen</a>'s "General Theory on Law and State" and the Pakistani Supreme Court decision in "the state v Dosso" for the proposition that a coup d'etat had been successfully executed in Uganda to oust and replace the preexisting legal order. Consequently, the 1966 Constitution was valid because it was the product of a successful revolution and formed a part of the new legal order.
The Court accepted that the Political Question Doctrine was applicable in Uganda but refuted the argument that the 1966 Constitution's validity was a political question. Nevertheless, the Court shied away from engaging the Executive arm of government on its exercise of discretionary power regarding the Applicant's detention on several fronts; relegating such determination to the National Assembly and the Executive arm itself. It also stated that making a pronouncement on the legality of a government was beyond its province.
On the other hand, it applied the above mentioned Kelsen theory to hold that the 1966 Constitution was the valid Constitution having replaced the 1962 Constitution after a successful coup d'etat or revolution in which the preexisting legal order was destroyed or deposed.

Lending credence to the continued existence and domineering presence of the ghost of Matovu and its embedded face of the Political Question Doctrine decades later, Prof Oloka-Onyango cites contemporary cases where the ghost precedent has influenced judicial decision making. He cites an application for injunctive relief in the 2014-15 case of "The Institute of Public Policy Research (Uganda) v the Attorney General" where the applicant sought a bar to the government's impending sponsorship of massive medical <a href="Human%20capital%20flight">brain drain</a> from Uganda to Trinidad and Tobago. The presiding judge, Justice Elizabeth, declined to grant the injunction, citing the Political Question Doctrine which had, at the time, recently been used by the country's Constitutional Court to dismiss a petition by Centre for Health and Human Rights Development (CEHURD), an NGO, against the government of Uganda in "Constitutional Petition No. 16 of 2011. 
The gist of Prof Oloka-Onyango's view is that these two decisions, in upholding the Political Question Doctrine, were detracting from the rise of judicial activism in Uganda, the proper functioning of the doctrine of checks and balances, the promotion of Public Interest Litigation and its associated Human rights protection, good governance as a whole and were also becoming a catalyst for the growth of unchecked Executive supremacy and the phenomenon of "presidentialism". He in fact states that the Political Question Doctrine is a "thinly-veiled cover for a much more dangerous spectre; the ogre of ″presidentialism″″".

Allusion is also made, however, to the second ghost begotten by ex parte Matovu, that is to say; Public Interest Litigation. The fact that the Court in ex parte Matovu chose to "jettison formalism to the winds" and hear the application before it in substance because it concerned the liberty of a citizen, despite its grave errors, also contributed to a new wave of judicial activism and justice-based litigation especially in the field of Human rights (civil and political rights mostly) and was entrenched further with the promulgation of the 1995 Constitution of <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a> wherein it is stated under Article 126 (2) (e) that "substantive justice must be administered by the Courts without undue regard to technicalities" and additionally, Public Interest Litigation is given Constitutional backing under Article 50.
Ghosts in Literature and Philosophy.
"See Section 2 of the full written lecture"
"Ghosts & the Law" contains a fairly simple salient proposition; that the far reaching precedent in ex parte Matovu, although created in the distant past of over 50 years, continues to have a haunting effect on the present body of Ugandan jurisprudence, popping from time to time in its many disguises to influence the course of legal events across the spectrum of law and governance. This so so even after an extensively long development of law, politics and governance that even led to the creation of a new Constitution in 1995; a Constitution that was meant to embody a fundamental break from the past of the ex parte Matovu times. Prof Oloka-Onyango says;

"″For the past 30 years of my academic career I have been battling with a ghost. Every time I believe he is dead and buried, he resurrects again and again … and again. And yes; I am pretty sure it is a ‘he.’ His name is ex parte Matovu. For any student of the Law, it is a sin not to be on intimate terms with this ghost, whose full name is Uganda v. Commissioner of Prisons, ex parte Michael Matovu. On February 2nd, 2017 Matovu’s case will be 50 years old.″″"

Therefore, we are presented with the constant image of this domineering concept or ghost that refuses to yield to the present, by maintaining its overbearing existence. The result is that law and governance continue to be molded by it. On the other hand however, its twin ghost, Public Interest Litigation also continues to present a constant challenge to it, acting as its antithesis and embodying the opposite features such as judicial activism in the form of effective checking and balancing of the coordinate branches of government, administering substantive justice without undue regard to formalism, extending the benefits of litigation to the poor and indigent through liberalizing the concept of legal standing and so on. An analysis then ensues as to which ghost will prevail, for each one is the antithesis of the other. 

Under this section, Prof Oloka-Onyango also broadly provides a context within which to appreciate the full import of the phenomenon of "ghosts" in general human life; socio-culturally, religiously, philosophically, artistically, legally and in all other aspects. He does this by tracing "ghosts" through literature and philosophy, using the latter as the foundational step for analyzing ghosts in jurisprudence, which is the philosophy of law.
He delves into an exposition of the universality of "ghosts" as a concept across a large section of the world and both within the present and the past. And of course the future. <a href="Hauntology">Hauntology</a>, he stipulates, is not peculiar to Africa alone, but is universal and traceable all throughout life in even the least expected of aspects, across all times under consideration. He opines that ghosts, as a haunting phenomenon in the present, from the past, are representative of a message that we ought to carefully digest and give attention to. He notices that 'ghosts' carry human qualities inherently, representing a part of ourselves.
He traces the universal presence of ghosts through art because as he states, "″before law there was art″" and also recognizes the important place of art as a medium of expression on culture, politics, law and governance. 

In particular here, he makes reference to <a href="Okot%20p%27Bitek">Okot p'Bitek</a>, a famous Ugandan poet and lawyer, about whom he says;

"″Uganda’s greatest poet was Okot p'Bitek [who] was also a critic, scholar, musician, events manager, philosopher, anthropologist and lawyer, all rolled into one. His most famous text, Song of Lawino which opens this lecture, is full of allusions to African spiritual bodies, Jwok in Luo (mizimu in our Bantu languages) who have their role throughout our history and even in contemporary society. But many of Okot’s other works looked at legal, anthropological and philosophical issues. Through his poetry Okot managed to combine these different disciplines into a coherent whole and in doing so demonstrated how the medium of poetry could be used to provide useful insights on the processes of law, politics and governance.″" 

He also makes reference to other important artists such as Byron Kawadwa, Robert Serumaga and Rose Mbowa with similar appreciation. On the non African scene, he cites expression of hauntology or presence of 'ghosts' in the works of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> and <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. In addition to these he adds too, works such as the <a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a> book collection, the <a href="Twilight%20%28novel%20series%29">Twilight</a> collection and even <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s very own <a href="Dreams%20from%20My%20Father">Dreams from My Father</a>. The Bible in addition to the domineering contributions of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Hegel</a> and <a href="Karl%20Marx">Marx</a> are also shown to be possessive of an aspect of hauntology.
Prof Oloka-Onyango concludes this section by stating that it should then not come as a surprise, that the Law too has its own ghosts and ghost stories.

In section 3 of the written Lecture, titled ""Ghosts, the Law and the Political Question Doctrine (PQD ): Ex Parte Matovu and its Militaristic Legacy"", Prof Oloka-Onyango also cites judicial precedents wherein the subject of 'ghosts' formed the substance of the cases being heard almost directly. These are the <a href="Hammersmith%20Ghost%20murder%20case">Hammersmith Ghost murder case</a> and <a href="Stambovsky%20v.%20Ackley">Stambovsky v. Ackley</a> which is also known as the "Ghostbusters ruling".

Reassessing Matovu’s Contribution.
Prof Oloka-Onyango, under a subsection titled as above, notes that while ex parte Matovu set the tone for decline of judicial power and independence in resignation to the Executive power, it also simultaneously set the positive tone for the gradual development of Public Interest Litigation, a competitive aspect that is associated with judicial activism, substantive justice without undue adherence to formalism and more proper and balanced exercise of power among the tripartite branches of government. 

""By upholding the validity of the ‘Pigeon-hole’ constitution of 1966 the Udoma panel in Matovu’s case effectively provided legal cover for what was plainly a coup d’etat. What followed was the emasculation of judicial power especially when confronted by executive excess. However, as the old saying goes every dark cloud has a silver lining. The silver lining in Matovu’s case was to allow the litigation to go ahead over strenuous objections raised by the Attorney General. Secondly, the court asserted its power of judicial review over the constitution when it could have adopted a less confrontational position and simply declared that it had no power to hear the application. Instead, on the question of access, the Matovu court adopted a progressive position particularly where, in the words of the court, the issue involves “the liberty of a citizen.""

Public Interest Litigation in Uganda Since the Promulgation of the 1995 Constitution.
Prof Oloka-Onyango explores the growth and development of the second, ex parte Matovu, that is to say Public Interest Litigation, post 1995. He notes that the 1995 Constitution of Uganda, within its numerous provisions and the National Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy preceding it, has been instrumental in the switch of the judiciary to a more 'activist' or assertive approach/stance rather than being the institution 'subordinate to' and lying within the shadow of the Executive arm of government.

""The change to a more assertive engagement by the judiciary with matters to do with governance and the actions of the other arms of the State is directly re-traceable to the 1995 Constitution."" 

In chronicling and analyzing the Ugandan Judiciary's gradual adoption of the above stated assertive stance in addition to the numerous occasional lapses and relapses, Prof Oloka-Onyango cites several Ugandan judicial decisions such as "Dr. James Rwanyarare & Ors. v. Attorney General", "Paulo Ssemogerere v. The Attorney General", "Attorney General v Major General David Tinyefunza", "Henry Tumukunde v the Attorney General", "Ananias Tumukunde v the Attorney General", "Attorney General v Joseph Tumushabe", "Julius Ochen & 205,000 Others v. The Attorney General", and others.

In the next subsection of the lecture, he also notes the low level of Public Interest Litigation in Uganda in respect of <a href="Economic%2C%20social%20and%20cultural%20rights">Economic, social and cultural rights</a>. He observes that most Public Interest Litigation is instead done in respect of civil and political rights and attributes this to the absence of categorical mention of most Economic, social and cultural rights within the bill of rights in Uganda's 1995 Constitution.

Importantly, Prof Oloka-Onyango delivered this lecture before the appeal from the Constitutional Court's decision in CEHURD (Centre for Health & Human Rights Development) v Uganda could be heard. In "CEHURD", the Constitutional Court dismissed the petitioner's action because it supposedly raised a Political Question which involved or would involve judicial inquiry into government policy and spending on maternal health care. It can therefore be said that at the time Prof Oloka-Onyango delivered his lecture, the negative side of the ghost of ex parte Matovu was in the lead, ahead of its antithesis, the ghost propounding Public Interest Litigation. Since then however, judgment has been given by the Supreme Court in respect of CEHURD's appeal in what can only be termed as a blow to the ghost of ex parte Matovu and the Political Question Doctrine in Uganda; and a victory for its twin, Public Interest Litigation. In its decision, the Supreme Court directed the Constitutional Court to hear and determine the "CEHURD" petition on its merits and held that the Political Question Doctrine has limited application in Uganda today. View the said Supreme Court decision <a href="https%3A//www.cehurd.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2015/11/petition-16-Uganda-Supreme-Court.pdf">here</a>
Conclusion.
In concluding his lecture, Prof Oloka-Onyango poses the above question and asserts his hope that the ghost of Public Interest Litigation will in the end come out victorious, for the better.

""The battle between the PQD and PIL now mainly centres around the status of ESCRs and on other issues in which the Judiciary is too timid to directly confront the Executive and Parliament. That battle brings the two ghosts of ex parte Matovu into head-on collision, i.e. the one which allows the government to escape all its obligations to ensure that human rights are respected, and the other which underlines the point that the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights also attaches to the State. Hopefully, in this battle over destiny PIL will eventually triumph. That should lead to reconciliation between the two ghosts with the good one of them prevailing over her evil sibling.""

The road ran across the Loyne over a stone arch bridge. Much of the original road survives either side of the loch, although the bridge across the river along with a segment of the road was flooded with the building of the dam. Occasionally the bridge has been visible when water levels are low in the loch.

Prior to the 1950's, the loch was originally much smaller being fed only by the naturally occurring <a href="River%20Loyne">River Loyne</a>. However, as part of a wider <a href="Hydroelectric">Hydroelectric</a> scheme, a dam was constructed in 1956 and completed in 1957 that increased the water level and flooded the original road built by Thomas Telford. A newer road, the current A87 was built higher up. The loch is visible to traffic on the road above. Water proceeds north from the dam via a tunnel into <a href="Loch%20Cluanie">Loch Cluanie</a>.

Werner Stuchlick (25 April 1919 – 28 November 1970) was a German infantry commander and recipient of the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Hauptmann Stuchlick received the Knight's Cross following the battles in East Prussia in October 1944. At this time he was commander of II./Fsch.Pz.GR. 2 "HG". When the Russians broke through the left flank of his battalion with powerful forces, Stuchlick scraped together whatever units he had for a counterattack. They amounted to his HQ unit, a pioneer squad and three assault guns. They charged into the advancing Russian forces and wreaked havoc, eventually forming a hedgehog position in the middle of the attacking enemy with the 3 assault guns and 15 men. Stuchlick held this position for three hours until ordered to withdraw back to German lines. This action led to his being awarded the Knight's Cross later that year.

The Architect and his Office

The Architect and his Office was a landmark report about the state of the British architectural profession in the early 1960s. It was commissioned by the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> in 1960 and the report was published in February 1962 with an introduction by <a href="William%20Holford%2C%20Baron%20Holford">William Holford</a>, then President of the Institute. Running to more than 250 pages, the report examined architectural education, fees and salaries, and management and technical competence. It was based on extensive fieldwork including a questionnaire survey and visits to nearly 70 architects' offices of various kinds. Funding of slightly more than £11,000 was provided for the study by the <a href="Leverhulme%20Trust">Leverhulme Trust</a>. 

According to <a href="Frank%20Duffy">Frank Duffy</a>, in his book "Architectural Knowledge: the Idea of a Profession", the study stands as one of the best studies of a profession ever carried out anywhere in the world (page 173). Duffy considers that the study did much to reform architectural practices in Britain, particularly by contributing to the development of the RIBA Plan of Work, a set of discrete stages of the architect's work from inception to completion. As well as each stage being precisely described, the stages also had a precise fraction of the total architect's fee associated with them. However, as Duffy also comments, the identification of the usual work pattern as 'normal services' also implied that many activities known as 'other services' (management, surveying, engineering) lay outside the work of the architect, and architects lost market share as a consequence of such exclusivity (page 179).

Werner Grunhold (24 February 1925 – 9 May 1945) was a German infantryman and recipient of the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Unteroffizier Grunhold was the leader of a company HQ squad during his division's battles in East Prussia in 1944. In the course of a Soviet assault his company commander became a casualty and, in the absence of any officers to replace him, Grunhold assumed command of the unit. He scraped together 15 men including 3 MG 42s and counterattacked against the Russian infantry who had broken into the main line of resistance. This violent counterattack broke up the attackers and led to 300 of them being cut off behind German lines, who were later liquidated by Grunhold's company. Grunhold then assumed command of the neighbouring infantry company as well and moved them into positions to face the next Russian attack. It was not long in coming, with infantry supported by seven tanks. Grunhold directed effective MG fire on the infantry and, under this covering fire, approached to 30 meters of the lead tank and destroyed it with a Panzerfaust. The remaining Soviet forces withdrew. For his skillful leadership and bravery on this day he was later awarded the Knight's Cross.

Grunhold, along with the vast majority of his division, was led into Russian captivity at the end of the war. He was shot by his captors in a POW camp near Strausberg, just outside of Berlin.

Minnedosa (schooner barge)

Minnedosa was a four-masted wooden <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> <a href="schooner">schooner</a> launched in 1890. This was late in the era of sailing ships and it spent its career as a barge, towed by a steam tug. It was lost with its nine crew and passengers and a heavy load of grain in a storm October 20, 1905 on <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a>. 

Construction and career.
The "Minnedosa" was constructed by the <a href="Montreal%20Transportation%20Company">Montreal Transportation Company</a> and was one of 41 ships ordered for Great Lakes service. It was launched at Kingston, Ontario on April 26, 1890 and was put into commercial service two days later, April 28. At 250 feet long, 36 foot beam and 15 foot depth, it was the largest Canadian-built sailing vessel on the Great Lakes. It had a <a href="gross%20tonnage">gross tonnage</a> of 1315 and a <a href="net%20tonnage">net tonnage</a> of 1041. 

The ship spent its entire working career as a <a href="Consort%20%28nautical%29">"consort barge"</a>, towed by a steamship or a tug. This practice became obsolete with the construction of large steel freighters for the lakes, but allowed more cargo to be moved at a slight cost in lowered speed and increased manpower. The "Minnedosa" was mostly used to move grain across the Great Lakes to Kingston. It was often paired with the .

In 1892 while in the <a href="Welland%20Canal">Welland Canal</a> the "Minnedosa" was damaged when the packet freighter "Arabian" struck a lock . Later that year the "Minnedosa's" mate was injured by waves on the deck. In 1894 through 1898 the ship was towed by the steamers "Algonquin", "Glengarry" and . In 1903 the masts were cut down, making "Minnedosa" a barge. 

Last voyage.
"Minnedosa" took on 75,000 bushels of wheat at <a href="Fort%20William%2C%20Ontario">Fort William, Ontario</a> on October 18, 1905. Along with the steamer "Westmount" and the barge "Melrose", it departed in tow for Kingston under the command of Captain John Phillips. The steamer was connected to the "Minnedosa" which in turn had a cable towing the "Melrose". The three ships passed through the locks at <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20Canal">Sault Ste. Marie</a> early on October 19 and passed De Tour, Michigan that evening, then entered <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a> where a strong wind was blowing with snow falling. The captain of the "Westmount", Alexander Milligan, directed the ships across <a href="Saginaw%20Bay">Saginaw Bay</a>. Late on the evening of October 20, the "Minnedosa" abruptly disappeared as the ships neared Harbor Beach. The crew aboard the barge "Melrose" recovered the tow cable and observed it had been cut; the "Melrose" was adrift. 

Captain Milligan turned "Westmount" and began to search for the two consort barges. The "Westmount's" crew discovered the towing post of the "Minnedosa" still attached to the cable when they pulled it on board. There was no trace found of the "Minnedosa" or its occupants, and the "Melrose" was taken back in tow at 5 AM October 21, making a safe arrival at Harbor Beach that afternoon. 

This same storm wrecked at least eleven ships, and damaged about 12 others, on the Great Lakes that day, with loss of several crews.

The "Westmount" and " Melrose" arrived at Kingston on October 26, 1905. 

Loss of the "Minnedosa" was attributed to its heavy load and storm damage, resulting in its taking on water. The wreckage of the "Minnedosa" was located in 1993, sixteen miles from <a href="Harbor%20Beach">Harbor Beach</a> at a depth of 210 feet. The deep water wreck can be inspected by properly equipped divers.

St. John de Britto College

St. John de Britto College is a private, <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>, <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> school founded in 1947, run by <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a>.

Foundation and development.
Expelled from the country soon after the establishment of the <a href="First%20Portuguese%20Republic">First Republic</a>, the Jesuits would return to Portugal in 1923. However, the juridical situation of the Jesuits in Portugal was normalized only with the 1933 Constitution and with the decree of May 12, 1941, which in following the 1940 Concordat recognized the Society of Jesus as a missionary corporation, enabling them to return to their educational and cultural activities. 

In 1947, Father Tobias Ferraz, SJ, <a href="Provincial%20superior">Provincial</a> of the Society of Jesus, acquired the Stromp estate at <a href="Lumiar">Lumiar</a>, where <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, at the beginning of 1846, had delighted the family with his piano playing. The new college, which occupied a pre-existing building, received the name and patronage of the Portuguese Saint <a href="John%20de%20Britto">John de Britto</a>, who had been canonized only months before on 22 June 1947.

Inspired by <a href="Ignatian%20Pedagogical%20Paradigm">Ignatian pedagogy</a> and <a href="Ignatian%20spirituality">spirituality</a>, the College is chartered and has autonomy for an in definite period, and has as its mission statement to "with excellence, train men and women for others and with others." Located in Lisbon, it has grown to enroll more than 1600 students for Pre-school, Basic Education, and Secondary Education. 

The Old House was refitted to accommodate the Jesuits, who moved in on 23 October 1947. On October 28 the College was formally constituted and on November 3 opened with 11 students, Fr. João Cabral, SJ, being rector. As enrollment grew the College required new facilities and in 1950 the architect Licínio Cruz was commissioned. Construction began on 7 October 1950, and occupancy a year later: classrooms, kitchen, dispensary, and dining room. On 7 October 1955 the college church, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, was solemnly blessed and inaugurated by the Cardinal-Patriarch <a href="Manuel%20Gon%C3%A7alves%20Cerejeira">Manuel Gonçalves Cerejeira</a>. The second phase of the building began in 1964, and was completed on 3 April 1965. Further infrastructure followed: primary pavilion (1976), tennis courts ( 1991), sports gymnasium (1993), another building for primary (1994), new refectory and bar (1995), administrative services (1996), auditorium (1997), swimming pool (1998), new facilities for CEB children (2000), soccer field with synthetic grass (2004), and rearrangement of pedestrian accesses and parking lots (2005).

Continuing education of the faculty.
The College has a training plan for the teaching staff that aims to improve teaching through collaboration among teachers and school-wide integration of best practices. Such mobilization for collaborative work assists problem solving in the educational context. Teachers become active participants, horizontally, in the professional development process, assuming as a mutual task the implementation of innovative teaching and learning strategies.

Extracurricular activities.
There is a Language Center where students can learn or deepen their knowledge of English, French, Spanish and Mandarin. Also a Fitness Center for localized gymnastics, hygienic gymnastics, and water aerobics. Sponsored sports are handball, gymnastics, football, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. Other extracurricular activities include ballet, creative dance, hip-hop, theater, dramatic expression, piano, viola, chess, and drums, as well as a summer sports program.

Honor Roll.
Honor Roll aims to distinguish students who excel in various areas of human, social, and academic achievement. It marks the progress made at each academic stage, valuing attitudes rather than results, albeit without neglecting academic excellence as a central objective in the school program. 

The prizes were designed to recognize values ​​and attitudes, rather than concrete and purely academic results, reflecting the goal of providing students with a comprehensive education and lifting up the <a href="Ignatius%20of%20Loyola">Ignatian</a> ideal of the<a href="Ad%20majorem%20dei%20gloriam">magis</a>. Thus, with the exception of the "School Achievement" award which recognizes academic results, all other awards recognize values ​​essential for integral Christian humanism as outlined in the College's Educational Project: spirit and dedication ("Sports Prize"), participation in the activities organized by the College and the spontaneous promotion of cultural or recreational activities ("Participation and Initiative"), the arts ("Artistic Creativity"), involvement in the area of ​​religious culture ("Religious Culture"), fortitude and determination ("Application and Effort"), and finally identification with the ideology ("Educate for Service"). 

José Carlos Belchior Prize.

Konrad Steets

Konrad Steets (30 March 1926 – 11 June 1948) was a German infantryman and recipient of the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Gefreiter Steets was a messenger in the Fallschirm-Panzergrenadier-Regiment 2 "Hermann Göring" during the battles in East Prussia in late 1944. He was to distinguish himself during the course of this fighting. On 19 October he was prevented from delivering a message due to the presence of two Soviet anti-tank guns in good positions. Him and several comrades were able to approach the anti-tank guns and destroy them with explosives, enabling the necessary dispatch to be delivered. Five days later, on 24 October, he observed an enemy battalion preparing to attack the boundary between his company and the neighbouring one. Acting completely alone he crept forward and allowed the advancing Russian infantry to pass by, and then opened fire from a range of less than 200 meters. It was in situations like this where the murderous rate of fire of the MG 42 spoke for itself, and soon 100 Russians lay dead and the remainder fled. The Russians lay down artillery fire on his position but he retreated from his hole, returning to it when the barrage had lifted. He then repelled the next attack, during which a squad of Russians was able to get very close to his positions. He killed eight of them and took the remaining three prisoner. Despite his very low rank of Gefreiter, his repelling a large Russian infantry attack all by himself did not go unrecognized and he received the Knight's Cross.

His CO described Steets as "the best and most willing soldier" in his battalion.

The singer explained to "<a href="Infobae">Infobae</a>" that "Una Na" tells a love story, with the message "once you start feeling something for someone after that first sight, it’s very difficult to go back and forget it, so you want to go deep with that story", making reference to her relationship with her boyfriend and music producer Santiago Mocorrea.

María Marte was born in the town of <a href="Jarabacoa">Jarabacoa</a>, Dominican Republic, in 1976. Her interest in cooking began during childhood, where instead of playing with a toy kitchen, she cooked real dishes for her friends. After training in a bakery, influenced by her mother, she decided to move to Spain, a country she considered "the cradle of <a href="gastronomy">gastronomy</a>".

Career.
In 2003, newly arrived from the Dominican Republic, Marte got a job <a href="dishwashing">cleaning dishes</a> at "El Club Allard" in Madrid. Her arrival at the restaurant coincided with the arrival of head chef Diego Guerrero. At first, this work was be combined with another, as a hairdresser, which kept her away from the kitchen, but allowed her to make a living for herself and her family.

Marte took advantage of her work as a dishwasher and watched the cooks, to learn from them. Hearing of a vacancy in the kitchen, she asked the head chef if she could be promoted. After not being allowed to move up the first time, she asked again once there was another opening. Given an opportunity this time, she began to work with Guerrero, doing food preparation and cleaning. Every day, she would arrive at work in the morning and start cooking, at 4:30 in the afternoon start scrubbing, and at 8:30 would cook again, because the dinner shift would be <a href="wikt%3Ain%20full%20swing">in full swing</a>. In interviews, she explained that she had started to sleep in the stairway to keep up with the rhythm.

After three months, head chef Guerrero said he had to find someone else to wash the dishes because Marte "was worth the kitchen." From there, she was promoted more, and in 2006, became the <a href="sous%20chef">second in command</a>. In 2007, the restaurant got its first Michelin star, which was an incentive for Marte to work harder. In 2011, they were awarded the second star. During these years, Marte worked in all parts of the kitchen: bakery, <a href="fridge">fridge</a>, meat and fish. Thanks to this, she acquired experience which she used as now-head chef, after the departure of Guerrero in 2013.

Her story of overcoming obstacles has not gone unnoticed to the press, which generally gives her very good reviews. In the newspaper "<a href="El%20Pa%C3%ADs">El País</a>", they write about "a <a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a> Michelin"; the magazine "<a href="Diez%20Minutos">Diez Minutos</a>" describes her as a "fighter"; "<a href="Elle%20%28magazine%29">Elle</a>" writes of her "triumph of constancy"; "<a href="El%20Correo">El Correo</a>" considers her a "brave and self-made woman with a story of a story".

With Guerrero's departure, she feared for the future of the two Michelin stars the restaurant had acquired. The change of chefs was in the 2014 <a href="Michelin%20Guide">guide</a>, and had been printed, so that although the head chef had changed, the restaurant's stars remained. In the following autumn came her reevaluation, and the inspectors considered Marte to deserve both stars. She explained that it felt "like winning two stars at once."

Marte says the way she cooks is to present "creative dishes", but "without transgressing or disguising the product". Her first new recipe at "El Club Allard" was Flor de Hibiscus, a <a href="caramelization">caramelized</a> <a href="hibiscus">hibiscus</a> flower with <a href="pisco%20sour">pisco sour</a> foam on a <a href="pistachio">pistachio</a> <a href="crumble">crumble</a>. The plate proved to be a success, and was so important to her that she has its image as a <a href="tattoo">tattoo</a>.

American Jewish cuisine

American Jewish cuisine comprises the food, cooking, and dining customs associated with <a href="American%20Jews">American Jews</a>. It was heavily influenced by the cuisine of Jewish immigrants who came to the United States from Eastern Europe around the turn of the 20th century. It was further developed in unique ways by the immigrants and their descendants, especially in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and other large metropolitan areas of the northeastern U.S.

History.
Between 1881 and 1921, around 2.5 million Jews immigrated to the United States from Eastern Europe. Most of them settled in large cities in the northeastern part of the country, especially <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. These immigrants brought with them a well-developed culinary heritage. The cuisine continued to evolve in America, in the homes of the immigrants and their descendants, and in <a href="delicatessen">delicatessen</a>s and <a href="appetizing%20store">appetizing store</a>s in New York City and elsewhere.

Delicatessens were quite popular among second-generation American Jews, especially in the mid-twentieth century. They provided a place for the patrons to socialize in a comfortable environment. They also popularized some of the dishes now associated with American Jewish cuisine, which were affordable for their upwardly mobile customers, but which would have seemed luxurious to their European ancestors. Though not as numerous as they once were, delicatessens continue to be popular dining destinations.

Kosher food.
<a href="Kosher%20foods">Kosher food</a> is food that conforms to "<a href="kashrut">kashrut</a>", i.e. Jewish dietary laws. Under these rules, some foods – for example, <a href="pork">pork</a> and <a href="shellfish">shellfish</a> – are forbidden. Any meat must come from an animal that was slaughtered using a process known as "<a href="shechita">shechita</a>". Jewish dietary law also prohibits the eating of meat and milk at the same meal. For this purpose, "meat" includes the flesh of mammals and birds, and "milk" includes dairy products such as cheese. Thus a kosher delicatessen selling corned beef sandwiches would not have any cheese, and a kosher bakery selling bagels and cream cheese would not have any meat. Many foods are classified as <a href="pareve">pareve</a> (sometimes spelled "parve") – neither meat nor milk, and therefore acceptable at any meal. Pareve foods include fish, eggs, honey, and any edible plant. Kosher commercial establishments must be closed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, during the <a href="Shabbat">Jewish sabbath</a>.

American Jewish cuisine may or may not be kosher. For example, some delicatessens follow Jewish dietary law in the preparation and serving of food, while others do not. Followers of <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox Judaism</a>, the most traditional form of Judaism, generally eat only kosher food. Some other more-observant Jews also eat kosher food most or all of the time. However the majority of American Jews are less observant of traditional rules, and eat non-kosher food. According to a 2012 study by the <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a>, 22 percent of American Jews keep kosher in their homes.

Kosher-style food.
<a href="Kosher%20style">Kosher-style food</a> is food that is made in the style of kosher food but that does not necessarily conform to Jewish dietary laws. For example, a kosher-style <a href="hot%20dog">hot dog</a> is an all-beef hot dog that is mildly spiced with garlic and other spices, and a kosher-style <a href="pickled%20cucumber%23Kosher%20dill%20%28US%29">pickle</a> is a sour pickle aged in brine with garlic and dill. The term "kosher-style" may also refer to American Jewish cuisine in general.

Passover.
During the annual eight-day <a href="Passover">Passover</a> holiday, Jews who are more traditionally observant do not eat <a href="chametz">leavened bread</a>. During Passover some American Jews eat <a href="matzah">matzah</a> and other foods that conform to this restriction.

American Jews, like Jews elsewhere in the world, often participate in a <a href="Passover%20Seder">seder</a> at the beginning of Passover. This is a ritual feast that includes the telling of the story of Passover – <a href="the%20Exodus">the Exodus</a> of the Jews from Egypt. At a seder, the <a href="Passover%20Seder%20plate">seder plate</a> is a plate with special food items that are symbolic of different aspects of Passover.

Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrahi cuisine.
The majority of American Jews are <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a>, whose ancestors came from Eastern Europe or Germany, where many of them spoke <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> as their first language. The foods commonly associated with American Jewish cuisine have their origins in Eastern Europe. The United States also has a sizeable population of <a href="Sephardic%20Jews">Sephardic Jews</a>, whose ancestors lived in Spain or Portugal, and later in other Mediterranean areas, and <a href="Mizrahi%20Jews">Mizrahi Jews</a>, whose ancestors lived in the Middle East or North Africa. Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews have their own distinct cuisines, which, like Ashkenazi cuisine, were heavily influenced by their places of origin.

Popular dishes and foods.
Popular dishes in American Jewish cuisine include:

Notable restaurants, delicatessens, and grocery stores.
Notable American Jewish restaurants, delicatessens, and food stores include:

Dining at Chinese restaurants on Christmas.
The American Jewish custom of eating at Chinese restaurants on Christmas Day or Christmas Eve is a common stereotype portrayed in film and television, but it has a factual basis. The tradition may have arisen from the lack of other open restaurants on Christmas, as well as the close proximity to each other of Jewish and Chinese immigrants in New York City.

Albert Plapper

Albert Plapper (13 April 1926 – 28 January 1945) was a German infantryman and recipient of the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Gefreiter Plapper was serving with the Fallschirm-Panzer-Division "HG" when it fought in East Prussia in October 1944. At the time he was a squad leader in the division's second Panzergrenadier regiment. During a large Soviet assault in his sector an MG crew was knocked out by enemy fire, and Plapper took over the weapon and repelled the attack. The Russians later renewed their attack, this time with armour support. Plapper counterattacked their open flank with five men, firing his MG from the hip, however additional Russian tanks threatened to break through his positions nonetheless. Using a Panzerschreck Plapper destroyed five Russian tanks and finally brought the attack to a halt. For his decisive role in preventing a Russian breakthrough, Plapper was awarded the Knight's Cross later that year.

Marguerite Bennett (born 1988) is an American <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> writer. She has worked on on "<a href="DC_Comics_Bombshells%23Comic_books">Bombshells</a>", "<a href="Angela_%28comics%29">Angela</a>", "<a href="Josie_and_the_Pussycats_%28comics%29">Josie and the Pussycats</a>", and her <a href="Creator%20ownership%20in%20comics">creator-owned</a> book "<a href="InSeXts">InSeXts</a>".

Biography.
Bennett was born in 1988 in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and graduated <a href="Maggie%20L.%20Walker%20Governor%27s%20School%20for%20Government%20and%20International%20Studies">Maggie L. Walker Governor's School</a> in 2006, the <a href="University%20of%20Mary%20Washington">University of Mary Washington</a> in 2010, and <a href="Sarah%20Lawrence%20College">Sarah Lawrence College</a>, completing a 2-year <a href="Master%20of%20Fine%20Arts">MFA</a> writing program, where her work included working on prose, including children's literature and horror and left with a "couple of finished novels and a collection of short stories".
Her first exposure to comics was through "" which she saw in daycare, aged around 6, and recalls it had a 1930s feel with <a href="Batman">Batman</a> looking like a villain who "had been a bad guy and so was now catching other bad guys in order to be a good guy again". As she grew up, she also drew on characters' depictions in video games and books she obtained through relatives and others and continued to dip in and out of comics while juggling academic study and other commitments as she grew up and moved into college. Bennett states she developed a deep appreciation from an early age of how text and art work together in comics and how they enable storytelling to take risks and developed powerful stories which leave "lasting impressions on readers".
She currently lives in Los Angeles. She has stated that Batwoman is her favourite DC character, <a href="Quasimodo">Quasimodo</a> is her favourite literary character, <a href="Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast%20%281991%20film%29">Belle</a> is her favourite <a href="Disney">Disney</a> character and <a href="The_Fall_%282006_film%29">The Fall</a> is her favourite movie.

Career.
Whilst at Sarah Lawrence College, she took <a href="Scott%20Snyder">Scott Snyder</a>'s graphic novel writing course during her second semester in 2013. This led to her debut in comics, after being approached by Snyder to ask if she wanted to work with him on an issue of the Batman Annual. After completing this, while finishing her MFA and juggling two jobs, she continued to work with <a href="DC%20Comics">DC</a> and wrote single issue stories for "<a href="Lobo%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Lobo</a>", "<a href="Batgirl">Batgirl</a>" and "<a href="Talon%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Talon</a>" in 2013 and 2014. This led to being part of the writing team for the 26-issue weekly "<a href="Earth-Two%23Earth%202%20in%20The%20New%2052">Earth 2: World's End</a>", starting at the end of 2014, along with <a href="Daniel%20H.%20Wilson">Daniel H. Wilson</a> and Mike Johnson, with art by <a href="Ardian%20Syaf">Ardian Syaf</a>, Danny Miki, <a href="Jorge%20Jimenez%20%28comics%29">Jorge Jimenez</a>.
Over at <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a>, Bennett completed single stories in the "<a href="Amazing%20X-Men">Amazing X-Men</a>" Annual, the "<a href="Death%20of%20Wolverine">Death of Wolverine</a>" series, and "<a href="Nightcrawler%20%28comics%29">Nightcrawler</a>". Her first on-going was "Angela: Asgard's Assassin" in 2015, followed by two limited series starring the same character, one of which was in the <a href="Marvel%201602">1602 Universe</a> as part of the <a href="Secret%20Wars%20%282015%20comic%20book%29">Secret Wars</a> event. For that same event, Bennett also wrote the five-issue limited series "<a href="Days_of_Future_Past%23Secret_Wars_.282015.29">Years of Future Past</a>" with artist <a href="Mike%20Norton">Mike Norton</a>.
Bennett worked with writer <a href="G.%20Willow%20Wilson">G. Willow Wilson</a> and artist Jorge Molina to launch "<a href="A-Force">A-Force</a>" in 2015, featuring Marvel's first all-female team of <a href="Avengers%20%28comics%29">Avengers</a>. Bennett said there was no validation or event as to how the women were in charge, but that "they were the best fit for these roles and demands of their world".
Back at DC, Bennett was a vocal fan of the <a href="DC%20Comics%20Bombshells">DC Bombshells</a> character designs - and following the positive reaction to the 2014 <a href="variant%20cover">variant cover</a>s used across DC titles, she was approached by editor Jim Chadwick about the possibility of making a comic. The resulting series, "<a href="DC_Comics_Bombshells%23Comic_books">DC Comics Bombshells</a>", is set in an alternate history around World War 2. Bennett explored traditional genres and mediums of the 1940s such as radio shows and propaganda films to provide a realistic history for the Bombshells franchise. Key to the characters is that none of the women are derived from a male version or counterpart and states that she wanted a cast representing the experiences of all women - "queer characters, women of color, women of different faiths, women of different nations, women of all ages and from all places in life" - but without overt or tokenistic labelling. Acknowledging the importance of these aspects, she explains that “We were able to complete this whole new world that wasn’t just one thing because no woman is just one thing. So they each got to have a distinct voice, a distinct personality”.
The run - scheduled for 100 "digital first" installments - has been noted for its female core cast, but also the portrayal of LGBT characters and depicting of the nuances of female friendship, family and relationships, rather than stereotypes. She reflects on this, saying "If you write stories that tell folks that queer people can live without shame, they just might grow up believing it".
In addition to her work on the character in "Bombshells", Bennett wrote the Batwoman character in "<a href="Detective%20Comics">Detective Comics</a>" issues 948 and 949 in 2017 as part of the <a href="DC%20Rebirth">DC Rebirth</a> relaunch, co-writing with <a href="James%20Tynion%20IV">James Tynion IV</a> with art by <a href="Steve%20Epting">Steve Epting</a>, followed by a regular "Batwoman" series. She describes working on the character as a "literal dream come true", describing her as her favourite heroine. 
As well as the on-going "Bombshells" and "Batwoman", Bennett has written <a href="one-shot%20%28comics%29">one-shot</a> stories of female characters in the DC universe, including <a href="Lois%20Lane">Lois Lane</a> - a character she finds has great "audacity in the face of danger" - and a new version of the <a href="Duela%20Dent">Joker's Daughter</a>.
Outside of Marvel and DC, Bennett has worked on some well-known characters with other publishers. For <a href="Dynamite%20Comics">Dynamite Comics</a>' 2015 "Sword of Sorrow" event, Bennett wrote a three-issue series featuring <a href="Red%20Sonja">Red Sonja</a> and <a href="Jungle%20Girl%20%28Dynamite%20Entertainment%29">Jungle Girl</a>. She then wrote the first six-issue arc of "Red Sonja" in 2016, entitled "The Falcon Throne". As part of <a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie Comics</a>' <a href="New%20Riverdale">New Riverdale</a> relaunch, she wrote the second volume of "<a href="Josie%20and%20the%20Pussycats%20%28comics%29">Josie and the Pussycats</a>" with Cameron DeOrdio with artist Audrey Mok. Bennett admires how all versions of those character emphasise their friendship as the "foundation of their journey, music, and story".
Creator owned work.
Bennett has also moved into <a href="Creator%20ownership%20in%20comics">creator-owned</a> comics work. "InSeXts" was launched by <a href="Aftershock%20Comics">Aftershock Comics</a> in 2015 and saw Bennett collaborating with artist Ariela Kristantina. Building on a story she contributed to Rachel Deering’s 2014 anthology "In The Dark", Bennett describes it as erotic horror involving a pair of lovers, with insectoid transformations and <a href="List%20of%20body%20horror%20media">body horror</a> themes. It is set during <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> times, a period she states she is preoccupied and fascinated with, albeit without a love of the period. The series is ongoing and has multiple arcs planned.
Bennett's second creator owned work, "Animosity", launched in 2016. It explores the effects of animals gaining the intelligence of humans, centered on a young girl and a dog. This ongoing features art and colour by Rafael de Latorre, Juan Doe and Rob Schwager. An associated limited series, "Animosity: The Rise" started in early 2017 and with art by Juan Doe. A companion series, "Animosity: Evolution" will launch in October 2017 with art by Eric Gapstur.

Advanced Innovation Design Approach

Advanced Innovation Design Approach (AIDA) is a holistic approach for enhancing innovative and competitive capability of industrial companies. The name Advanced Innovation Design Approach (AIDA) was proposed in the research project "Innovation Process 4.0" run at the <a href="University%20of%20Applied%20Sciences%20Offenburg">University of Applied Sciences Offenburg</a>, Germany in co-operation with 10 German industrial companies in 2015-2017.
AIDA can be considered as a pioneering mindset, an individually adaptable range of strongest innovation techniques such as comprehensive front-end innovation process, advanced innovation methods, best tools and methods of the theory of inventive problem solving <a href="TRIZ">TRIZ</a>, organisational measures for accelerating innovation, and IT-solutions for Computer-Aided Innovation, elaborated in the recent decade in the industry and academia.

Initially the AIDA has been conceptualised as systemic approach including analysis, optimizations and further development of the innovation process and promoting the innovation climate in industrial companies. The innovation process with self-configuration, self-optimization, self-diagnostics and intelligent information processing and communication, is understood as a holistic system comprising following typical phases with feedback loops and simultaneous auxiliary or follow-up processes: uncovering of solution-neutral customer needs, technology and market trends, identification of the needs and problems with high market potential and formulation of the innovation tasks and strategy, systematic idea generation and problem solving, evaluation and enhancement of solution ideas, creation of innovation concepts based on solution ideas, evaluation of the innovation concepts as well as implementation, validation and market launch of chosen innovation concepts. <br>
The Advanced Innovation Design Approach was refined and further developed for the application in the field of process engineering in the context of the EU research project "Intensified by Design - Platform for the intensification of processes involving solids handling” within international consortium of 22 universities, research institutes and industrial companies under H2020 SPIRE programme.

Principle of completeness.
As a holistic innovation approach AIDA postulates the complete problem analysis and a comprehensive idea generation and problem solving. The problems faced by the industry can not be solved by single eureka idea. 
The principle of completeness in the new product development can be illustrated by following 4 steps.

Another example demonstrates the principle of completeness in the phase of the innovation strategy formulation. For the complete identification of existing and future customer needs or benefits several complementary methods are used simultaneously:


AIDA innovation tools.
AIDA tools or apps most frequently used in the practice include:


Advanced Innovation Design Methods.
The new Advanced Innovation Methods are the basis for the further development of the AIDA-tools or apps. The following list will be regularly updated:<br>

Advanced Design (2014) - Methods for the early stage of the innovation process, proposed by the research team of the Politecnico di Milano, Italy.<br>
Advanced design methods for successful innovation (2013) - new methods in the industrial design from the Dutch research platform Design United.<br>
Inventive Design Method (IDM) - INSA Strasbourg France.<br>
Root Conflict Analysis RCA+ (2011) - universal method for comprehensive problem and contradiction analysis.

Eliza Ann McIntosh Reid

Eliza Ann McIntosh Reid (October 30, 1841 — January 8, 1926) was a Canadian churchworker and clubwoman, and an advocate for women's rights.

Early life.
Eliza Ann McIntosh was born in <a href="Montreal%2C%20Quebec">Montreal, Quebec</a>, the daughter of Nicholas C. McIntosh and Margaret Brown McIntosh. Her parents were from <a href="Montrose%2C%20Angus">Montrose, Angus</a> in Scotland; her father was a cabinetmaker. The McIntoshs were members of the Unitarian Church from early in Eliza's life.

Two of Eliza Ann McIntosh's sisters married to <a href="George%20Washington%20Stephens%2C%20Sr.">George Washington Stephens, Sr.</a>, and <a href="George%20Washington%20Stephens%2C%20Jr.">George Washington Stephens, Jr.</a> was her nephew.

Career.
Eliza Ann McIntosh Reid was a leader in the Montreal Unitarian Church for decades, as director of the church's Unity Club and founder (in 1898) of the church's Young People's Alliance. She and her husband raised funds towards the building of the Church of the Messiah, and Eliza Ann Reid was on the board of managers for the new church. "So much of her life was lived for the church and so much of the inspiration of her many outside good works had its source in the church and in the life of the free spirit for which it stands," noted her daughter. 

In 1892, Reid held a meeting at her home and there founded the Montreal Woman's Club, one of Canada's first women's organizations. She was the organization's president for its first ten years. She was also one of the founders and leaders of the Montreal Council of Women. Reid took an interest in a range of reform issues, from parks and playgrounds to temperance, public health, and immigration policy. She served on the board of directors of the <a href="Victorian%20Order%20of%20Nurses">Victorian Order of Nurses</a> in Montreal in the 1920s.

Personal life.
Eliza Ann McIntosh married Scottish-born stone carver Robert Reid in 1867. They had four children born between 1868 and 1878. With Eliza's active support, daughter <a href="Helen%20Richmond%20Young%20Reid">Helen Richmond Young Reid</a> was in the first class of women to enroll at <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a>.

Antifa (United States)

Antifa is a far-left militant political movement of autonomous, self-described <a href="Post-WWII%20Anti-fascism">anti-fascist</a> groups in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. The term is loosely used to refer to <a href="anti-racist">anti-racist</a>, <a href="Sexism">anti-sexist</a>, <a href="Homophobia">anti-homophobia</a>, as well as <a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a> and <a href="anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a> groups. Unlike the <a href="Left-wing%20politics">traditional left</a>, the ambit of self-described antifa groups is to oppose fascism in <a href="direct%20action">direct action</a>. These groups are usually anti-government and anti-capitalist, and their methodologies and tactics are more aggressively violent and <a href="Anarchism">anarchistic</a> than those of associated groups in the <a href="far%20left">far left</a>.

According to "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>", the "word Antifa has its roots in <a href="Antifaschistische%20Aktion">Anti-Fascist Action</a>, a name taken up by European political movements in the 1930s" which was revived in the 1990s, particularly in Germany. <a href="Peter%20Beinart">Peter Beinart</a> writes that "in the late ’80s, left-wing <a href="Punk%20rock">punk</a> fans in the United States began following suit, though they initially called their groups <a href="Anti-Racist%20Action">Anti-Racist Action</a>, on the theory that Americans would be more familiar with fighting racism than fascism." Antifa groups are known for militant protest tactics, including property damage and sometimes physical violence. Antifa focuses more on fighting far-right ideology than encouraging pro-left policy.

History.
The first group described as Antifa was the <a href="Antifaschistische%20Aktion">Antifaschistische Aktion</a> formed in 1930s Germany. Anti-fascists were also involved in battles against <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>’s <a href="Blackshirts">Blackshirts</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>’s <a href="Brownshirts">Brownshirts</a> and <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>'s nationalist army. Outside of Europe, anti-fascist tactics were used as a model for anti-Japanese resistance in occupied-China during World War II. 

Groups forming in the United States "initially called their groups <a href="Anti-Racist%20Action">Anti-Racist Action</a> Network, on the theory that Americans would be more familiar with fighting racism than fascism." In <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a> a group called the Baldies in 1987 formed a group with the intent to fight <a href="Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazi</a> groups.

Antifa groups either form loose support networks, such as NYC Antifa, or operate independently.

Activity.
Antifa is composed of autonomous groups, not a formal organization. Activists typically organize protests via <a href="social%20media">social media</a> and through websites and list-serves. According to <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> it is an organizing strategy, not a group of people, and is commonly associated with a willingness to engage in a <a href="show%20of%20force">show of force</a>. Antifa groups have most notably protested the 2016 election of <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>. During the <a href="inauguration%20of%20Donald%20Trump">inauguration celebrations</a> mask-wearing black bloc protestors "rage[d] across the area just outside" of the security perimeter, "smashing windows and burning cars." 

According to <a href="Peter%20Beinart">Peter Beinart</a>, Antifa activists "combat white supremacism not by trying to change government policy but through direct action. They try to publicly identify white supremacists and get them fired from their jobs and evicted from their apartments," in addition to "disrupt(ing) white-supremacist rallies, including by force."

In June 2017 Antifa was linked to anarchist extremism by the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Office%20of%20Homeland%20Security%20and%20Preparedness">New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness</a>.

Street violence.
Antifa protesters participated in the <a href="2017%20Berkeley%20protests">2017 Berkeley protests</a> where they gained mainstream media attention, "throwing Molotov cocktails and smashing windows." Later, two Antifa groups threatened to disrupt the 2017 <a href="Portland%20Rose%20Festival">82nd Avenue of Roses Parade</a> after hearing that the Multnomah County Republican Party would participate. The parade organizers received an anonymous email, saying, "You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely". The email also said that 200 people would "rush into the parade" and "drag and push" those marching with the Republican Party. The two groups denied having anything to do with the email. The parade ended up being canceled by the organizers due to safety concerns. 

Antifa counter protestors at the the far-right <a href="2017%20Unite%20the%20Right%20rally">2017 Unite the Right rally</a> In <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> in August 2017 "certainly used clubs and dyed liquids against the white supremacists." Journalist Adele Stan interviewed an Antifa protester at the rally who said that the sticks carried by Antifa protesters are a justifiable countermeasure to the fact that "the right has a goon squad." Some Antifa participants at the Charlottesville rally chanted that counter-protesters should "punch a Nazi in the mouth."

Approaches.
The nature and activities of Antifa have caused some debate among anarchists; the prominent anarcho-communist website "It’s Going Down" published a critique of Antifa in November 2016 originally from "Lucha No Feik", entitled "On Antifa: Some Critical Notes." The article criticised Antifa for essentially being a reactive, rather than a proactive force. The article argues that Antifa are too hyper-focused on micro <a href="Neo-Nazi">Neo-Nazi</a> groups or single figures such as President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, instead of "analyzing the structural nature of our racist society." "It's Going Down" stated that the Antifa's ideological position was "but a few steps removed from the Liberal position that we should just all get along." It also pointed out that Antifa did not protest against the administration of President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>. This elicited a response from three active participants in the movement with "What do US Antifascists Actually Believe?", where they stated, "Mobilizing large radical movements against <a href="neoliberal">neoliberal</a> (or populist) capitalism is not the focus of anti-fascism; this is the work of the anarchist and anti-capitalist movements as a whole."

According to <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a>, "People who speak for the Antifa movement acknowledge they sometimes carry clubs and sticks," and their "approach is confrontational." CNN describes Antifa as "known for causing damage to property during protests." Scott Crow, described by CNN as "a longtime Antifa organizer," argues that destroying property is not a form of violence. 

According to Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the California State University, San Bernardino, Antifa activists participate in violent actions because "they believe that elites are controlling the government and the media. So they need to make a statement head-on against the people who they regard as racist." According to Antifa organizer Crow, Antifa is based on the idea of <a href="direct%20action">direct action</a>, "The idea in Antifa is that we go where they (right-wingers) go. That hate speech is not free speech. That if you are endangering people with what you say and the actions that are behind them, then you do not have the right to do that. And so we go to cause conflict, to shut them down where they are, because we don't believe that Nazis or fascists of any stripe should have a mouthpiece."

He played college basketball for <a href="Louisville%20University">Louisville University</a>, being with them during their <a href="2012-13%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20men%27s%20basketball%20season">2012-13 champion season</a> despite not playing a single minute with the team due to NCAA regulations.

Early life and high school career.
Mathiang was born in <a href="Juba">Juba</a> under what is now <a href="South%20Sudan">South Sudan</a>. At the age of five, he, his mother and five siblings fled war-torn Sudan and moved to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> to set up a move to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. His father, Alfret, decided to stay behind in <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>. Mathiang and the rest of his family arrived in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> with extended family members when he was seven years old before moving to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> a year later. Until he was sixteen years old, Mathiang played football with Australian rules as his main sport for <a href="Emmanuel%20College%20%28Victoria%29">Emmanuel College</a> in <a href="Altona%20North">Altona North</a>. However, due to him being 1.98m tall, he was encouraged to start playing basketball instead, moving to the United States of America with his friend, Ran Tut, to achieve that goal.

During his junior year of high school, he played basketball for <a href="Brehm%20Preparatory%20School">Brehm Preparatory School</a> in <a href="Carbondale%2C%20Illinois">Carbondale, Illinois</a>. After that, Mathiang moved out to <a href="Bradenton%2C%20Florida">Bradenton, Florida</a> to play his senior season at the <a href="IMG%20Academy">IMG Academy</a>. In his senior season, he averaged 14 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 blocks per game as he helped the IMG Academy get themselves a 28-2 record and become one of 11 players from the team that year to earn scholarships to NCAA teams.

College career.
He originally was with the Louisville Cardinals during the 2012-13 season, but due to NCAA regulations relating to international players like Mathaing, he was forced to sit out his first season with the team.

Throughout his NCAA career, Mathiang mostly played as a bench reserve, with him usually alternating spots as a starter at times for Louisville. During his junior season, he would be limited to playing in only 10 games total for them due to an injury that would sideline him for the majority of that season. As a result of when the injury came about, he would not be deemed eligible for another redshirt season that year. His best season would be in his senior year with Louisville, where he would average 7.8 points and 6.0 rebounds in 20.8 minutes of action per game in 33 games played.

Professional career.
After going undrafted in the <a href="2017%20NBA%20Draft">2017 NBA Draft</a>, Mathiang played for the <a href="Charlotte%20Hornets">Charlotte Hornets</a> during the <a href="2017%20NBA%20Summer%20League">2017 NBA Summer League</a>.

Ventolín

The ventolines (: for "little airs" or "little fans") are creatures of the <a href="Cantabrian%20mythology">Cantabrian mythology</a>. They are spirits of the air that help to those who sail in the sea.

Ventolines are described like angels with large green wings and eyes as white as waves breaking. They live in the reddish clouds where the sun sets.

When an old fisherman grew tired of raising his nets, ventolines came down from the sunset clouds and loaded the fish in the boat. They even wiped his sweat and sheltered him with their green wings when it was cold. Then they would take the oars and bring the boat to the docks. Other times, they would raise the sail, and if it was not windy, they blew inflating their cheeks and flying behind the boat making a breeze enough for the boat to sail.

Paulsgrave Williams

Paulsgrave Williams (active 1716-1723, first name occasionally Paul, Palsgrave, or Palgrave) was a pirate who sailed the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, American eastern seaboard, and off <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. He is best known for sailing alongside <a href="Samuel%20Bellamy">Samuel Bellamy</a>.

History.
Bellamy intended to loot the wrecks of the <a href="1715%20Treasure%20Fleet">1715 Spanish treasure fleet</a>, reportedly to impress the family of Mary Hallett, whose <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a> family disapproved of her marrying a poor sailor. In <a href="Boston">Boston</a> he befriended 40-ish <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport</a> <a href="silversmith">silversmith</a> Paulsgrave Williams whose age, wife and children, and well-to-do lineage made him an unlikely pirate. Together in early 1716 they traveled to the Caribbean with a few dozen treasure-hunters and searched the wrecks unsuccessfully. Despairing, they traded their canoes for small <a href="Periagua">periaguas</a> and turned to piracy.

They were driven off from a captured <a href="sloop">sloop</a> by the approach of several ships. The approaching ships were not <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> or <a href="privateers">privateers</a>; they were fellow pirates led by <a href="Henry%20Jennings">Henry Jennings</a>, <a href="James%20Carnegie">James Carnegie</a>, and <a href="Leigh%20Ashworth">Leigh Ashworth</a>. They hid in nearby marshes to observe Jennings’ fleet before hailing them. Joining forces, they captured a French ship that happened into the area. Jennings took his group to chase another ship, leaving Bellamy and Williams to loot the French ship, which they promptly did and sailed away before Jennings could return.

Soon they met with <a href="Benjamin%20Hornigold">Benjamin Hornigold</a>. Impressed with Bellamy and Williams – and no fan of Jennings - Hornigold took them in and joined forces with them alongside <a href="Olivier%20Levasseur">Olivier Levasseur</a>’s ship "Postillion". While successful, Hornigold’s crew resented his reluctance to attack English ships. They voted him out of command in Spring, electing Bellamy as Captain of Hornigold’s ship "Marianne", and placing Hornigold and a few supporters in a captured sloop to make their way back to <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a>. Bellamy appointed Williams as his <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a> and sailed with Levasseur for several months. Williams and Bellamy continued to operate out of <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a> through 1716. Near the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a> in December 1716 they captured two ships, "Pearl" and "Sultana". Bellamy transferred to the "Sultana", giving Williams the "Marianne" and letting "Pearl" go free with all the sailors who refused to take up piracy.

They took several more ships together in the coming months before Levasseur went his own way. In February 1717 they spotted the slave ship "Whydah" (occasionally "Ouidah, Wedaw, Whido", etc.); they pursued it for three days before it surrendered. Bellamy transferred to the "Whydah", giving its captain the "Sultana" in exchange. Now with one of the largest and best-armed ships on their side of the <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>, Williams and Bellamy sailed northward, pillaging ships up the American east coast. Separated by fog and storms off <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, they soon met up again and sailed toward <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>. Bellamy granted the captured ship "Anne Galley" to his quartermaster <a href="Richard%20Noland">Richard Noland</a>. They agreed to meet off the coast of <a href="Maine">Maine</a>; Bellamy took the "Whydah" back toward Cape Cod with Noland while Williams put in at <a href="Block%20Island">Block Island</a> in mid-April to visit relatives.

While waiting off Maine in May 1717 Williams learned that the "Whydah" and one of Bellamy's prize ships had been caught in a terrible storm that April and were wrecked on the coast with almost all hands lost, including Samuel Bellamy. Williams may have visited the site of the wreck before sailing back south to New Providence. Williams had a number of sailors on board whom he'd forced into piracy, including his carpenter; on the way south he had to put down a mutiny among his crew when a number of them (led by the forced sailors) rebelled. He arrived in the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> at almost the same time as Noland, who had survived the storm that claimed "Whydah". He sold the worn-out "Marianne" and along with Hornigold and many others, accepted the pardon offered by <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George</a> to all pirates who surrendered by September 1718.

Williams was soon back at sea, serving first under <a href="William%20Moody%20%28pirate%29">William Moody</a> and then as quartermaster under his old accomplice Olivier Levasseur in 1720 off the coast of Africa. He was said to be unhappy no longer being in command, and sailors were advised to continue calling him “Captain” to get on his good side. By 1723 he had retired from piracy, settling down with a new wife to start a family again. He died peacefully years later.

Wolfgang Hartelt

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Oberfähnrich Hartelt was a platoon leader in the Panther battalion of the Fallschirm-Panzer-Division "HG" 1 during the division's fighting retreat in January 1945. When his company commander was badly wounded on 23 January Hartelt took command in his stead. The next day his company and its five remaining tanks were ordered to provide the rearguard for his regiment. In the evening Hartelt and fellow tank commander Amrein launched a probe from the village they were positioned in, finding and destroying four Soviet tanks. Hartelt now called up his remaining tanks and continued moving forward, attacking whatever Soviet forces they encountered to deter the Soviet pursuit. Following this he pulled back to regroup with his regiment. In the morning of the next day, while en-route to their parent unit, Hartelt's company encountered a village held by strong Russian forces. Despite being heavily outnumbered they were able to break through and destroyed 25 Soviet tanks in the process. Of these, Hartelt was personally responsible for 7, bringing his personal total of destroyed tanks to 17. Because of this, and for successfully thwarting Russian attempts at pursuit, Hartelt was awarded the Knight's Cross.

Reception.
The <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> review by Thom Jurek said ""Blood Sutra" only adds more luster to Iyer's presence on the short list of forward-looking jazz creators these days. His muse still tends towards the severe but there's no denying the individuality and the fact he doesn't make the listening easy is also precisely what makes it so rewarding". Writing for <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a>, Dan McCleneghan observed "An initial listen to "Blood Sutra" had me thinking "no new ground broken here" since "Panoptic Modes" and "You Life Flashes" (Pi Records, 2002) by Fieldwork, an Iyer trio vehicle. But a "sit down and concentrate on the sounds" session reveals nuances and subtle shadings creeping in ... Vijay Iyer evolves in fascinating fashion". The <a href="JazzTimes">JazzTimes</a> review by Nate Chinen noted "This is exciting and eminently listenable stuff, intuitive in bearing and dynamic in execution.
An essential for adventurous listeners, "Blood Sutra" could also serve as an ideal introduction to Iyer's burgeoning oeuvre".

Amelia (1795 ship)

Amelia was built in France in 1787. The British captured her in 1793. She became a general trader that made a voyage as a <a href="whaler">whaler</a> in the South Seas Fishery before returning to trading. She made one voyage as a <a href="slave%20ship">slave ship</a>. She is last listed in 1806, but the data is stale.

Career.
Although the British captured "Amelia" in 1793, she does not appear in "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" until 1795. At that time her master is Whitock, her owner is Lushington, and her trade is London—St Vincent.

In late 1795 and early 1796, "Amelia" sailed as part of Admiral <a href="Hugh%20Cloberry%20Christian">Hugh Cloberry Christian</a>'s expedition to the West Indies. After numerous false starts aborted by weather issues, the fleet sailed on 26 April to invade <a href="St%20Lucia">St Lucia</a>, with troops under Lieutenant-General <a href="Ralph%20Abercromby">Sir Ralph Abercromby</a>. St Lucia surrendered to the British on 25 May. The British went on to capture <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20%28island%29">Saint Vincent</a> and <a href="Grenada">Grenada</a>. It is not clear when "Amelia" returned to Britain.

"Lloyd's Register" for 1798 shows "Amelia" master as Scott, her owner as Lushington, and her trade as South Seas Fishery.

"Amelia" was at Rio de Janeiro in June 1797 to replenish her food and water. She was reported to have been at the Galapagos in August/September 1798. She returned to England in March 1799.

The "Register of Shipping" for 1800 reported that W. Scott was still master of "Amelia", and that her trade was London—Cape of Good Hope. "Lloyd's Register" for 1800 shows "Amelia"s master changing to Higgins, and her owner to Sims. The 1801 volume confirms the changes and now shows "Amelia"s trade as Liverpool—Africa, something that generally signals a slave trader. "Amelia" does not appear in a database of Liverpool-based slave traders, but does appear in the one for London-based ones. The database shows "Amelia"s master as Isaac Higgins, and her owner as John Simms. It does not reveal where she gathered her human cargo, but does report that she delivered them to Jamaica. "Amelia" left Jamaica for London, but then had to put back because she had become leaky.

"Amelia" is last listed in "Lloyd's Register" for 1806, but with data unchanged from 1801.

Lightguard Systems

Lightguard Systems is a California <a href="traffic%20safety">traffic safety</a> device company known for developing “Smart Crosswalk”, the earliest pedestrian safety system to use <a href="embedded%20pavement%20flashing-light%20system">embedded pavement flashing-light system</a>s.
Founding.
Lightguard Systems Inc. produces Lighted Crosswalk Systems invented by its founder, Michael Harrison. Inspired by a series of fatal pedestrian traffic incidents in Santa Rosa, California in 1991, Harrison developed the first LightGuard system as a safety aid for installation at <a href="Crosswalk">pedestrian crossing</a>s and started LightGuard Systems to produce them.
A <a href="commercial%20pilot">commercial pilot</a>, Harrison was inspired by the flashing lights used as runway <a href="beacon">beacon</a> lights. He applied this principle for crosswalk visibility and founded LightGuard Systems to produce and install systems based on the technology he developed. 
Lighted Crosswalk System.
“The experimental ‘Crosswalk Warning System’, also known as the ‘LightGuard System’ or the ‘Santa Rosa Lights’ consists of warning lights housed in a unit which is installed on the pavement adjacent to a marked crosswalk. The lights reflect out toward the oncoming traffic to warn drivers of a pedestrian’s presence.” <br><br>
Developed with an <a href="embedded%20pavement%20flashing-light%20system">embedded pavement flashing-light system</a>, the LightGuard system includes flashing lights and other visual cues to influence driver behavior near pedestrian crossings. Systems may be manually operated or activated automatically through electronic sensors.
LightGuard’s Smart Crosswalk and other Embedded pavement flashing-light systems can be powered from the electrical grid or by on-site solar power sources.
Safety.
Reports cite that studies conducted at specific locations where no traffic signal was present have shown lighted crosswalk systems like those produced by LightGuard and other manufacturers increased driver awareness of crosswalks, increasing pedestrian safety. One study calculated an increase in driver awareness of 20-95%.
Installations.
LightGuard has installed its eponymous system in locations throughout the US, including at the <a href="Miami%20International%20Airport">Miami International Airport</a> and others at <a href="San%20Francisco%20City%20Hall">San Francisco City Hall</a>, as well as sites in Mexico.
Location.
The company has offices in <a href="Sonoma%20County%2C%20California">Sonoma County, California</a>

The history of the the NDC Mediagroep starts at the very earliest with the first publication of the <a href="Leeuwarder%20Courant">Leeuwarder Courant</a> by <a href="Abraham%20Ferwerda">Abraham Ferwerda</a>, on 29 July 1752.

20th century.
On 1 January 1955 the publishers of the <a href="Friese%20Koerier">Friese Koerier</a> of <a href="Heerenveen">Heerenveen</a> and the <a href="Leeuwarder%20Courant">Leeuwarder Courant</a> merged to form the Friese Pers. On 1 November 1969 the Friese Koerier was merged into the Leeuwarder Courant.

On 2 January 1990 the Friese Pers merged with the <a href="Nieuwsblad%20van%20het%20Noorden">Nieuwsblad van het Noorden</a> to form the Fries-Gronings-Drentse Pers (FDGP).

The Plot.
Karnan is the autobiography of Karna, and yet it is not just that. With deceptive case, Sawant brings into play an exceptional stylistic innovation by combining six "dramatic soliloquies" to form the nine books of this novel of epic dimensions. Four books are spoken by <a href="Karna">Karna</a>. These are interspersed with a book each from the lips of his unwed mother Kunti, Duryodhana (who considers Karna his mainstay), Shon (Shatruntapa, his foster-brother, who here-worships him), his wife Vrishali to whom he is like a god and, last of all, Krishna. Sawant depicts an uncanny similarity between Krishna and Karna and hints at a mystic link between them, investing his protagonist with a more-than-human aura to offset the un-heroic and even unmanly acts which mar this tremendously complex and utterly fascinating creating of Vyasa 

"Karnan" takes a look at the events in the Mahabharata from the perspective of Karna, a major character in the epic

He was a merchant from <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a> who settled in the county in the late 1170s. He seized Botrun through his marriage to its heiress, Lucia.

He married Lucia, the only daughter of <a href="William%20Dorel">William Dorel</a>, <a href="Lordship%20of%20Botrun">Lord of Botrun</a>, and thus seized the lordship, around 1180.

Chinese cruiser Hǎi Tiān

Hǎi Tiān () was the second ship of the <a href="H%C7%8Ei%20Q%C3%AD-class%20cruiser">"Hǎi Qí"-class</a> of <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>s and one of the last built for the <a href="Manchu">Manchu</a> <a href="Qing%20Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>.

Background.
In the late 19th century, China, which had been ruled for over two hundred years by the Qing dynasty, was subject to a series of humiliating <a href="unequal%20treaty">unequal treaties</a> with foreign powers after <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">a devastating military defeat</a> at the hands of the emerging <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>. With their armies and navies shattered, China appeared weak to the <a href="great%20power">great power</a>s who were eager to expand their financial and political control over China. In order to rebuild their military and reassert their own national sovereignty, the Qing government appointed the Marquis of Suyi, <a href="Li%20Hongzhang">Li Hongzhang</a> as a special envoy to Europe on May 1896. Li, a veteran diplomat, was tasked with ordering new warships from foreign dock yards, visiting the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> throughout the summer of 1896. A pair of protected cruisers were ordered from <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> of <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> in the United Kingdom as part of this. "Hǎi Tiān" was ordered along with her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> <a href="Chinese%20cruiser%20H%C7%8Ei%20Q%C3%AD">"Hǎi Qí"</a> on October 1896, two months after Li's visit to Britain. The two ships were based on an improved design, which Armstrong Whitworth had build for <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> a year earlier but made to Chinese dimensional specifications. "Hǎi Tiān", although laid down 16 February 1897, three months after "Hǎi Qí", and launched 25 November 1897, two months after "Hǎi Qí"'s launch, "Hǎi Tiān" was completed a month ahead of the "Hǎi Qí". Both ships were brought to China by a contract crew, and handed over to the China's <a href="Beiyang%20Fleet">Beiyang Fleet</a> on August 1899. "Hǎi Qí" and "Hǎi Tiān" would be the largest ships in the Chinese navy until after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Service history.
"Hǎi Tiān" had a very brief and uneventful career in the <a href="Imperial%20Chinese%20Navy">Qing Navy</a>. Shortly after the start of <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> which plunged China into chaos, the Beiyang Fleet was sent to reinforce the <a href="Taku%20Forts">Dagu forts</a> on 31 May 1900. During this time there was an uneasy state of high alert between the increasing number of foreign warships and the Chinese fleet, although tensions were high no shots were fired between the two sides. Eventually on 16 June 1900, the twenty-three ships of the <a href="Eight-Nation%20Alliance">Eight-Nation Alliance</a> anchored off Dagu made an ultimatum to the fort, demanding its surrender to the allied fleet in order to relieve the <a href="Siege%20of%20the%20International%20Legations">Siege of the International Legations</a> in the capital, <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>. The commanding officer of the forts, General <a href="Luo%20Rongguang">Luo Rongguang</a> refused and open fired on the foreign ships, leading to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Taku%20Forts%20%281900%29">Battle of Dagu Forts</a>. The anti-Boxer governor of <a href="Shandong">Shandong</a>, <a href="Yuan%20Shikai">Yuan Shikai</a> ordered the Beiyang fleet south, in order to prevent the possibility of the outgunned ships from being captured or destroyed by the alliance navies, as had happened to the four new German-built <a href="H%C7%8Ei%20L%C3%B3ng-class%20destroyer">"Hǎi Lóng"-class destroyer</a> and the <a href="torpedo%20gunboat">torpedo gunboat</a> . These five ships were captured by allied forces during the capture of the forts dock facilities. From Dagu, the remains of the Beiyang fleet, which consisted of the protected cruisers "Hǎi Tiān", , , and the torpedo gunboat , sailed south to <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> and finally to <a href="Jiangyin">Jiangyin</a> where they quietly stayed for the next year with the <a href="Nanyang%20Fleet">Nanyang Fleet</a> until the end of the war on 7 September 1901.

Less than four years later at 5:30 AM on 25 April 1904, "Hǎi Tiān" under the command of future admiral <a href="Liu%20Guanxiong">Liu Guanxiong</a> was sailing to Shanghai from <a href="Yantai">Zhifu</a> when he became engulfed in fog at <a href="Weihai">Weihai</a>. "Hǎi Tiān" overshot the entrance to the <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a> and struck a pinnacle rock just off the <a href="Shengsi%20Islands">Shengsi Islands</a> in <a href="Hangzhou%20Bay">Hangzhou Bay</a>. Abandoned by the evening, the crew were rescued by passing Chinese customs cruisers. Attempts to salvage the ship failed save for the rescue of her <a href="EOC%208%20inch%2045%20caliber">EOC 8 inch 45 caliber</a> guns. This left "Hǎi Qí" as the sole surviving member of her class for the rest of her service.

Subbasement

Subbasement is a floor or set of floors below the main <a href="basement">basement</a> floor. In contrast to regular basements where many of them have small amount of vertical space located above ground, subbasements are essentially underground spaces underneath the home or other building. Subbasements have similar uses as basements as they're used as storage areas, but less commonly used as living spaces compared to main basements.

During the construction, building a subbasement is more difficult, more costly, and more time-consuming than building a traditional basement as the lowest floor. Plus subbasements are even more susceptible to floods and water damage than the main basement. As a result of all these, subbasements are rare in homes and other buildings and are more commonly found in dry climates and high elevations.

There are famous landmarks having subbasements. The subbasement in the <a href="U.S.%20Capitol%20Building">U.S. Capitol Building</a> is used as storage and that in the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> is used to store guest items.

<doc id="54807802" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54807802" title="Lucius Burbuleius Optatus Ligarianus">
Lucius Burbuleius Optatus Ligarianus

Lucius Burbuleius Optatus Ligarianus was a <a href="Roman%20empire">Roman</a> <a href="Roman%20senate">senator</a> of the second century, who held several offices in the emperor's service. He was <a href="Roman%20consul">suffect consul</a> in the "<a href="nundinium">nundinium</a>" of May-August 135 as the colleague of <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Papus">Marcus Aemilius Papus</a>. He died while governor of <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">Syria</a>.

An inscription in <a href="Minturnae">Minturnae</a>, erected after his death and honoring him as <a href="Patronage%20in%20ancient%20Rome">patron</a> of the city, records his "<a href="cursus%20honorum">cursus honorum</a>". Anthony Birley notes that this inscription, and that he was patron of the colony, all point to Ligarianus having a residence there, but as his <a href="Roman%20tribes">tribe</a> was Quirina, and the city was enrolled in the Terentina tribe, it was not his place of origins. "Although the very rare "gentilicium" is not found outside of Italy", concludes Birley, "he may have been a provincial."

Life.
His first recorded office was as a "tresviri capitales", one of the magistracies that comprised the "<a href="vigintiviri">vigintiviri</a>". This was the least desirable office to hold, for men who held that office rarely had a successful career: Anthony Birley could find only five "tresviri capitales" who went on to be governors of consular imperial provinces. This was followed by a stint as <a href="military%20tribune">military tribune</a> with <a href="Legio%20IX%20Hispana">Legio IX Hispana</a> in the reign of <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a>, about the time it was transferred from <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a> to a new base along the Rhine frontier. Next he served his <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a>ship in the province of <a href="Bithynia%20and%20Pontus">Bithynia and Pontus</a>, which had to follow <a href="Pliny%20the%20Younger">Pliny the Younger</a>'s presence there, as the latter never mentions him in his letters from that province. Ligarianus then held in order the next two republican magistracies, <a href="aedile">aedile</a> and <a href="praetor">praetor</a> which, like the majority of his recorded career, were held during the reign of <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>.

That he had to work to achieve his consulship is reflected in the number of offices he had to hold between being praetor and his consulship. First he was curator of the Viarum <a href="Via%20Clodia">Clodia</a>, <a href="Via%20Cassia">Cassia</a> and <a href="Via%20Cimina">Cimina</a>; oversight of the three Italian roads was usually combined. Next he was curator of the public funds of cities in <a href="Gallia%20Narbonensis">Gallia Narbonensis</a>, and of the cities <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a> and <a href="Tarracina">Tarracina</a> in Italy. According to Mirielle Corbier, this was part of an effort by the emperor Hadrian to regularize the finances of cities in the Roman Empire; the senator <a href="Publius%20Pactumeius%20Clemens">Publius Pactumeius Clemens</a> carried out similar duties at the same time. Next Ligarianus was commissioned <a href="legatus">legatus</a> or commander of <a href="Legio%20XVI%20Flavia%20Firma">Legio XVI Flavia Firma</a>, stationed in Syria. Next he was appointed <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a>ar governor of <a href="Sicily%20%28Roman%20province%29">Sicily</a> (130/131); this was followed by another administrative position, prefect of the "<a href="aerarium%20Saturni">aerarium Saturni</a>" with <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Papus">Marcus Aemilius Papus</a> (132-135). 

Papus and Ligarianus became acquaintences, for their paths crossed more than once again, most notably as consuls in the same "nundinium". Ligarianus' first consular office was "curator operarum locorumque publicorum", or overseer of the public works and places of Rome, around 136; his immediate successor was Papus, who is attested in that position 15 May and 13 December 138. 

Ligarianus succeeded the historian <a href="Arrian">Arrian</a> as governor of <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>, an office he held at the time of Hadrian's death (10 July 138); which years his tenure began and ended are uncertain. <a href="G%C3%A9za%20Alf%C3%B6ldy">Géza Alföldy</a> dates his tenure from c. 138 to c. 141, while <a href="Werner%20Eck">Werner Eck</a> offers the years 137 and 140. Birley writes Ligarianus "might never held a consular command but for the fact that Hadrian, in the closing years of his reign, had come to distrust many of his former friends." Despite lack of military experience, Ligarianus must have been a success in this role for when he completed his tenure in Cappadocia, <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a> appointed him governor of Syria; this new responsibility must have followed without a break after he had left Cappadocia, for Alföldy offers the dates of c. 141 and c. 144 as when Ligarianus began and ended his tenure in Syria.

Gardi's grandmother and two aunties were killed in that attack by Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime. Gardi's father is originally from the Kurdish region of Turkey and fled to Iran due to oppressive treatment by the Turkish Government.

Gardi's parents are political activists. They fought against the persecution of Kurds and fought for Kurdish rights and independence in Iran before fleeing to Pakistan. Gardi's family were resettled to New Zealand under the quota as political refugees in 1998 when she was seven years old.

Legal career and advocacy.
Gardi graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) and a Bachelor of Arts, double majoring in Political Studies and International Relations, and Criminology in 2016.

Before formal sentencing, Emery disappeared from the <a href="Claiborne%20Pell%20Newport%20Bridge">Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge</a> just hours after being released on bail. Although he was declared legally dead in 2004, Emery remains on the FBI's most wanted list.

Murder of Jason Bass and disappearance.
On the evening of August 31, 1990, Adam Emery's 1985 Ford Thunderbird was sideswiped by a passing vehicle while him and his wife, Elena, were at a Rocky Point restaurant with another couple. Enraged, Emery mistakenly chased down the wrong car, and stabbed the driver to death with a military knife, twenty-year-old Jason Bass. Analysis conducted using paint chips from both vehicles determined that someone else had hit Emery.

On November 10, 1993, Emery was convicted of second-degree murder, and was to await formal sentencing. Emery was released on bail, and subsequently disappeared hours later, along with his wife; they both mailed suicide notes, and their car was found abandoned on the Newport bridge. The couple were seen at a fast food restaurant, and purchasing wearable exercise weights prior to their disappearance. In 1994, a skull later identified as Elena's was found in the Narragansett Bay below the Newport Bridge.

In 2004, Emery was declared legally dead, however, in 2010, the FBI placed him on their most wanted list. They believe Emery may have travelled to Florida or Italy.

One Day in the Haram

One Day in the Haram is a 2017 feature length <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> about the <a href="Masjid%20Al%20Haram">Haram in Makkah</a>. The film was produced as a collaboration between Arabia Pictures and Al Reasah Haramin. It is the extraordinary story of the <a href="Masjid%20Al%20Haram">Haram in Makkah</a>, a place so revered that non-Muslims are forbidden from even setting foot in it. For the first time in history, witness the inner workings of the <a href="Masjid%20Al%20Haram">Haram</a>, as seen through the eyes of the workers, over a full day period. Director <a href="Abrar%20Hussain%20%28filmmaker%29">Abrar Hussain</a> spent over a year researching different aspects of the Haram, to bring the most complete and compelling vision of the <a href="Masjid%20Al%20Haram">Haram</a> ever produced. Packed with knowledge and never before seen footage, this is a film that anyone with even a passing interest in Islam is encouraged to see.

Background.
In an interview with "<a href="http%3A//twasul.info/">Twasul</a>", Executive Producer Abdululeh Al Ahmary said that the work came at the "initiative of the <a href="Custodian%20of%20the%20Two%20Holy%20Mosques">Custodians of the Two Holy Mosques</a>, specifically by its President, <a href="Abdul%20Rahman%20Al-Sudais">Dr. Abdul Rahman Al-Sudais</a>, which aims to raise awareness of the modern <a href="Masjid%20Al%20Haram">Haram</a>, and to spread the true image of <a href="Muslim">Muslims</a>, their culture, and the definition of the Holiest place on Earth". Al Ahamary continues, "The aim of this work is also to show dedication and faith, in addition to instilling peace in the hearts of the viewers of the film."

The film was written and directed by <a href="Abrar%20Hussain%20%28filmmaker%29">Abrar Hussain</a>, a British film producer. Previously a Series Producer at <a href="Islam%20Channel">Islam Channel</a>, Hussain directed and produced the popular returning TV shows Model Mosque (2007) and Faith Off (2008). Hussain presented the final of Model Mosque at the <a href="Global%20Peace%20and%20Unity">Global Peace and Unity</a> (GPU) event in 2007, in-front of a live audience of 30,000 people. Judges on the Model Mosque show included <a href="Salma%20Yaqoob">Salma Yaqoob</a> and <a href="Iqbal%20Sacranie">Iqbal Saccranie</a>. Both Model Mosque and Faith Off were positively received by the mainstream media, with <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>, <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>, and <a href="ABC%20News%20%28Australia%29">ABC News Australia</a>, reporting positively on the show. 

Hussain began the pre-preproduction on "One Day in the Haram" in June of 2015. Initial research included working closely with the Haram media department Al-Reasah Haramain. In an interview with <a href="Arab%20News">Arab News</a>, Hussain said he "wants to show how successfully the mosque is run, how organized its departments are, and how seriously its workers take their jobs". As part of the research Hussain conducted detailed analysis of 60 different departments within the Haram, and interviews many of the employees of these departments, to ascertain which departments and employees would be the best fit for the film.

Synopsis.

The workers represent the human face of the Haram, and the film explores the work they do as well as the spiritual motivation of the employees. Hussain organised the film across the <a href="Salah">5 daily prayers</a> (<a href="Fajr%20prayer">Fajr</a>, <a href="Dhuhr%20prayers">Dhur</a>, <a href="Asr%20prayer">Asr</a>, <a href="Maghrib%20prayer">Magrib</a> and <a href="Isha%20prayer">Isha</a>) focusing on the jobs carried out by different departments of the Haram within these time frames. 

Key scenes include a focus on the social media of the haram, the cleaning department, the Imams, <a href="Zamzam%20Well">ZamZam</a> water, religious affairs, maintenance, IT department, and the <a href="Kiswah">Kiswah</a> cloth.

Lanman founded the <a href="independent%20music">indie</a> <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a> band, “The Good Hurt” in <a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle</a> circa 2009. After four years and two national tours playing festivals such as <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">SXSW</a> and <a href="CMJ">CMJ</a>, he launched a solo career in 2013 and produced his debut album "Live at the Blue Boar Inn" in 2017. This album kicked off his "The 100 Days Tour", a national <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> singing tour.

Early life.
Lanman is the second of five sons of Dr. Richard Lanman and Alanna Purcell Lanman, born on July 8, 1983. He grew up and attended high school in <a href="Los%20Altos%2C%20California">Los Altos, California</a> where he played four sports but ironically did not make the cut for the prestigious Main Street Singer’s program. Lanman would later attend the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, where he graduated with a <a href="B.A.">B.A.</a> in Theater and Performance Studies as well as a minor in <a href="Rhetoric">Rhetoric</a> in 2007.

Career.
Lanman’s music career began as a house music <a href="disc%20jockey">DJ</a> in high school. He later worked as a resident DJ in Florence, Italy where he purchased a used guitar for $60 and began writing songs on it. His career as a singer songwriter took him up and down the West Coast from <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> where he performed with The Seattle Rock Orchestra at the <a href="Moore%20Theatre">Moore Theatre</a>. Singing gigs took him abroad to <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, where Lanman starred in an internationally televised commercial for <a href="If%20P%26amp%3BC%20Insurance">IF Insurance Company</a> singing a cover of <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>’s "<a href="Don%27t%20You%20Worry%20%27bout%20a%20Thing">Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing</a>".

In 2009, he founded an <a href="independent%20music">indie rock band</a> called "The Good Hurt" in Seattle. The band toured nationally playing festivals from <a href="CMJ">CMJ</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City%2C%20New%20York">New York City</a> to <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a> in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>. After making a name for himself in Seattle as both an independent artist and as frontman of "The Good Hurt", Lanman left in 2013 for <a href="Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York">Brooklyn</a> and produced his debut solo <a href="extended%20play">EP</a> in the same Brooklyn studio frequented by the likes of <a href="Skrillex">Skrillex</a>, <a href="Jhen%C3%A9%20Aiko">Jhené Aiko</a>, <a href="Joey%20Bada%24%24">Joey Bada$$</a> and <a href="Kid%20Cudi">Kid Cudi</a>, whose career-defining single, "<a href="Day%20%27n%27%20Nite">Day 'n' Nite</a>", was recorded there in 2009.

Lanman continued composing original music and performing at various venues around New York City. He taught himself to program <a href="UX">UX</a>/<a href="User%20interface">UI</a> (user experience/user interface) for mobile devices, supplementing his music income by freelancing for technology companies, until getting two simultaneous job offers. He ended up rejecting both and decided to stick with music and pursue it full-time. Thus, the idea of "The 100 Days Tour” was born. In November 2016 Lanman sold off as much as he could of his personal possessions minus his musical instruments. He moved from New York to California, re-engineered a Sprinter van into a mobile studio and home and booked 100 house concerts and <a href="DIY">DIY</a> venues across the country through his fan network. The tour kicked off at the Blue Boar Inn near <a href="Park%20City%2C%20Utah">Park City</a> where he produced his first solo album "Live from the Blue Boar" in January 2017. On the tour, Los Angeles <a href="podcaster">podcaster</a> <a href="Chris%20Denson%20%28innovator%29">Chris Denson</a> interviewed Lanman and recorded his performance live for ‘’<a href="Innovation%20Crush">Innovation Crush</a>’’ in May 2017. Denson described the former graphic and web designer turned musician/entrepreneur as mastering “a new art of connection... through simple intimate performances on his 100-day tour”. In July 2017 Lanman gave a <a href="TEDx">TEDx</a> talk at TEDxFargo 2017 in North Dakota.

<doc id="54808396" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54808396" title="Ceet Fouad">
Ceet Fouad

CEET [pronounced: “see-TEE”] is part of the world’s second generation of graffiti artists, since he began painting in the 1980’s. He is considered one of the first, original painters of France. CEET Fouad was born in Algeria, of Moroccan descent, and moved to Toulouse, France, in 1978 at the age of seven years old.

Since 2003, CEET Fouad has been based out of southern China, near Hong Kong, as a prolific muralist, contemporary painter and business entrepreneur. He has ventured into graphic design to creating various sculptures and installations for various public, sponsored events. He has recently started his own new artist residency project called Jardin Orange in Shenzhen, China, which invites several international and local urban artists every month.

Graffiti background.
In adolescence, in 1988, he began tagging and bombing trains with his localgroup of friends, locally known as La Terrasse Possee between 1988 till 1990. Then, he became part of several other crewa in the following years:

He was officially sponsored by Adidas during 8 years from 1997 till 2004. During this time CEET was invited to travel across the U.S. He e eventually met up with the TATS CRU in the Bronx, New York City, which was the joining together of the French and NYC circles of graffiti.

Artist background and styles.
CEET has experimented with different media to achieve his characteristic level of quality, using acrylic and oil paint, as well as pens, markers, metal paints and sprays more familiar to street artists. The result is a richly textured and saturated surface and successfully evokes emotions of endearment and fun in his vibrant canvases.

‘The Chicanos’ Chicken Story

When CEET landed in China in 2002, he started scribbling visual images as a way of initial form of communication and these initial doodling sketches soon evolved to means of humour. The chicken references soon symbolised his experiences of living amongst the densely populated Chinese people of the city.

The last eight years while in China, CEET has been painting these funny «Chicanos» characters: they are small, colourful chickens with large eyes and round bodies. When asked what they mean, the artist has alluded that they serve as a parody of us human beings as we live in this modern, over-crowding world. In a deeper interpretation, the Chicanos chicken has been considered a “criticism of modern society for bringing up ‘followers’, people who afraid to stand out.

Exhibitions.
CEET has exhibited in galleries in countries including: Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, China, France, Holland, Belgium, Austria, USA and Morocco. While he continually exhibits in galleries all across the world each year, CEET’s presence in well-known international contemporary art shows over the last two decades serve as a true testament to his dedicated hard work and well-deserved place in the contemporary art world. Also, he also has been a regular artist-in-residence at the Montresso* Foundation’s art estate in Marrakech called Jardin Rouge since 2014.


DJ Experience.
Besides being a visual artist, Ceet has also an affinity for music. From a young age he has performed as a disk jockey across the world. He started being known as DJ Patrick Douchafleur, then became DJ Colonel Douchafleur; finally he is currently known as DJ Ceet. Ceet had Adidas sponsor the production of four breakbeat LE records of 1000 copies each:

Desert Golfing

Desert Golfing is a <a href="List%20of%20golf%20video%20games">golf video game</a> and <a href="art%20game">art game</a> developed and published by Blinkbat Games and released on August 6, 2014, for iOS and Android.

It received positive reception from critics for its addictive gameplay despite its extreme simplicity.

Gameplay.
The game takes place in an endless side-scrolling desert, where the player can shoot a golf ball using a one finger swipe to determine direction and power. The entirety of the "golf course" is made of sand, making the physics of the golf ball more difficult to predict and control, as if from a <a href="Hazard%20%28golf%29">bunker</a>. The goal is to make the golf ball reach each hole in the fewest number of shots, but when this happens the game continues with a new, randomly generated course. Therefore, the game never ends, and the score is ultimately solely dependent on how long the player plays the game.

Development.
The setting of "Desert Golfing" was inspired by the mention of "<a href="Journey%20%282012%20video%20game%29">Journey</a>" in a <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> <a href="http%3A//www.gamasutra.com/blogs/OscarBarda/20140731/222365/Art_movements_in_video_games_Justwalkingism.php">article</a> about art games and their penchant for making <a href="Adventure%20game">walking simulators</a>. The game's creator, Justin Smith, said that while those types of games bored him, he thought it would be interesting to make such a game with a more immediate challenge. He also compared it to the game "<a href="Penn%20%26amp%3B%20Teller%27s%20Smoke%20and%20Mirrors">Desert Bus</a>". Smith stated that he did not realize people would be so invested in the game and would have put more thought into making the later holes more different if he had known, or adding a true ending.

Each hole in the game is <a href="Procedural%20generation">procedurally generated</a>, but with human orchestrated constraints that slowly introduce new gameplay aspects, as well as environmental features and color pallet changes, possibly representing a day-night cycle, as the game goes on. The holes after 2000+ become harder, and "theoretically" may become impossible at some point, giving the game an unintentional ending.

Reception.
Tom Bramwell of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> rated the game 90/100 and gave it the "Recommended" award, calling it "wonderfully sparse" and "an art game take on [...] mobile sports rubbish". He called the control and physics "superb", and said that it succeeded equally well as an art game and as a fun video game.

Di Alessandro Zampini of <a href="IGN">IGN Italia</a> also rated the game 90/100, saying that it is "magnetic, minimalist and ruthless".

Kyle Orland of <a href="Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</a> called the game "addictive" and said that it achieves "transcendent beauty". Brendan Keogh called the game "majestic", "restrained and confident".

Interventions: A Life in War and Peace

Interventions: A Life in War and Peace is a memoir by former <a href="Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a> and <a href="2001%20Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">2001 Nobel Peace Prize</a> winner, <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a>. The book focuses on the workings of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Secretariat">United Nations Secretariat</a> and the conditions under which the Secretary General has to take decisions. The book is mainly set in the <a href="Post%E2%80%93Cold%20War%20era">Post–Cold War era</a> when Annan served as the Deputy Secretary General (1993 to 1996) and then as the Secretary General (1997 to 2006) of the United Nations. The book has been co-written with his former advisor and speechwriter Nader Mousavizadeh.

Synopsis.
The book recounts the role of the United Nations and Annan himself in some of the major conflicts during his tenure. During the <a href="Rwandan%20Civil%20War">Rwandan Civil War</a>, <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20918">United Nations Security Council Resolution 918</a> was passed to dispatch around 5,500 troops to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Assistance%20Mission%20for%20Rwanda">United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda</a>. However, Annan says that despite lobbying with around 100 governments and calling up many members himself, he did not receive a single serious offer for troop contribution, and that was a deeply formative experience of his career. The book also deals with Annan's efforts as the Secretary-General to focus the efforts of UN and its members on the bigger picture of providing health, education, clean water, and good governance to all. His work in challenging the idea of sovereign immunity claimed by tyrants to inflict suffering on their subjects, by means of setting up the <a href="International%20Criminal%20Court">International Criminal Court</a> and establishing special tribunals like the <a href="International%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20former%20Yugoslavia">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> is also discussed. 

Annan also describes the dilemmas he faced as a diplomat and negotiator, including in dealing with Israel's governments which were building settlements and on giving voice to <a href="Hamas">Hamas</a> which was embracing violence. He says that internal African politics and leadership was the main reason for Africa's woes, and not colonialism or other external factors.

Schnuckenack Reinhardt

Franz "Schnuckenack" Reinhardt (17 February 1921 – 15 April 2006) was a gypsy jazz musician (violinist), composer and interpreter. He was considered the "great violin virtuoso of Sinti music." He was a German <a href="Sinti">Sinto</a>; his music was mostly published and categorized under the contemporary names <a href="gypsy%20jazz">gypsy jazz</a> or "Musik deutscher Zigeuner" (music of German gypsies). He "made this music accessible to a broad public" and made the most significant contribution to the presentation of gypsy music and jazz in Germany into a concert form. He was the pioneer of this style of music in Germany and directly or indirectly inspired many of the succeeding generation of gypsy jazz players in that country, as well as preserving on record a great many folkloric and gypsy compositions for future generations.

Life and work.
Schnuckenack, a relative of the virtuoso Belgian guitarist <a href="Django%20Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a>, whom he never met personally, was born on 17 February 1921 in <a href="Weinsheim%2C%20Bad%20Kreuznach">Weinsheim</a>, Rhineland Palatinate, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. His father Peta, a cousin of Django's mother, was also a violinist. Like most musical gypsies, he started playing at an early age with his family which at first followed a roaming existence as did most gypsies of that day; he appeared in concerts with the band of his father from the age of twelve. In the 1930s, the family settled in <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a> and Schnuckenack studied music for a while at the Mainz-based <a href="Peter%20Cornelius%20Conservatory">Peter Cornelius Conservatory</a>. His nickname "Schnuckenack" - which quickly became his official nickname - comes from the <a href="Romani_language">Romani</a> expression "schnuker nak: ("nice nose"). During the <a href="Nazi%20era">Nazi era</a>, as a <a href="gypsy">gypsy</a> he was deported with his family in 1938 to the town of <a href="Cz%C4%99stochowa">Częstochowa</a> in south-central <a href="Poland">Poland</a>. They lived there for five years, the family disguised as German-Hungarian musicians, always fleeing from discovery. On five occasions, Schnuckenack barely escaped shooting by the <a href="SS">SS</a>; his younger brother was not so lucky and was deported to <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a> where he was killed. Schnuckenack remained underground until the liberation by the Allies. He then returned to <a href="Kulmbach">Kulmbach</a> in Bavaria. In Germany, he played for several years with the 7th US Army band and began to incorporate jazz into his repertoire.

In 1966, during a pilgrimage to Lourdes, Schnuckenack met a young man who would change his life: Sigfried Maeker. This producer convinced the violinist to make the music of the German gypsies accessible to a wide audience. Schnuckenack gathered musicians and formed a Quintett whose drummerless lineup with two rhythm guitars was an exact copy of Django Reinhardt's <a href="Quintette%20du%20Hot%20Club%20de%20France">Quintette du Hot Club de France</a> and which gave its first concert in November 1967 in <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>. This first Quintett consisted of Schnuckenack on violin and vocals, Daweli Reinhardt and Bobby Falta (who had also played with <a href="Joseph%20Reinhardt">Joseph Reinhardt</a> in the 1960s) on solo guitars, Spatzo Weiss on rhythm and Hojok Merstein on double bass. In 1967 and 1968, the group performed at the International Waldeck Festivals. In 1969, Bobby Falta and Daweli Reinhardt were replaced by Holzmanno Winterstein on rhythm guitar and the then 18-year old guitar virtuoso <a href="H%C3%A4ns%27che%20Weiss">Häns'che Weiss</a>, who hailed from East Germany, on lead acoustic guitar. This version of the Quintett released several albums including a live recording with the singer Lida Goulesco.

That version of the Schnuckenack Reinhardt Quintett dissolved in May 1972 with the departure of Häns'che Weiss, who went on to form the <a href="H%C3%A4ns%27che%20Weiss%20Quintet">Häns'che Weiss Quintet</a> with the teenage prodigy <a href="Titi%20Winterstein">Titian "Titi" Winterstein</a> on violin, Holzmanno Winterstein and Ziroli Winterstein on rhythm guitars, Hojok Merstein on double bass as well as himself on solo guitar.

Schnuckenack then formed a new quintet with the return of Bobby Falta on solo guitar, Schmeling Lehmann, and son Ricardo Reinhardt on rhythm guitars, and Jani Lehmann on double bass. According to Falta's preference, this quintet was more oriented towards jazz. In the following years, the quintet was replaced, and Schnuckenack's son Forello was the solo guitarist; the folkloristic part of the repertoire was again emphasized. Until 1991, the formation changed to a sextet, which was also made up of family members. Schnuckenack also performed with his "Talal" project, which followed the migration of the Roma from India to Europe.

One of Schnuckenack's most prized possessions was the "Pope violin" which was presented to him with a personal dedication by <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Pope Paul VI</a> in 1965. He never played this instrument for money but it was used solely on religious occasions such as festivals and pilgrimages.

Schnuckenack resided in <a href="Sankt%20Leon-Rot">Sankt Leon-Rot</a>, <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a> from 1982 until his death in 2006. In 2000 the film maker Andreas Öhlers made a documentary film about his life called "Die Ballade von Schnuckenack Reinhardt" (The Ballad of Schnuckenack Reinhardt) which detailed his music as well as his wartime experiences. This film accompanies Schnuckenack Reinhardt on a journey with his sons to places that marked him and his music for life; by taking his sons to the places in Germany and Poland where he was persecuted and to the places where he pursued his musical career after 1945, he wants to pass on the family’s history to them. The last stop on this itinerary is <a href="Samois-sur-Seine">Samois-sur-Seine</a> in France, the burial place of his great inspiration and relative, the jazz guitarist <a href="Django%20Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a>.

The Austrian artist <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Heller">André Heller</a>, who was a friend of Schnuckenack, wrote the song "Mein Freund Schnuckenack" together with Ingfried Hoffmann, in which he refers to the life of the musician whose life was affected by both great joy and great sadness.

Schnuckenack Reinhardt died on on 15 April 2006 at the age of 85, just after he had announced that he was retiring from performing, given a farewell concert April 1, 2006 in at the Parktheater in <a href="Bensheim">Bensheim</a>, Germany, and announced that he was transferring the leadership of his famous Quintett to his brother-in-law Schmitto Kling, leader of the group "Hot Club the Zigan".. He is buried in the main cemetery of <a href="Neustadt%20an%20der%20Weinstra%C3%9Fe">Neustadt an der Weinstraße</a>.

Schnuckenack's music differed from Django's, being a combination of both swing and Hungarian or eastern European styles with Romani vocals and high energy accompaniment, together with many traditional gypsy melodies and waltzes, but his various Quintetts played an important role in keeping Django's music alive especially through the 1960s when few others were playing it, and laid the foundation for numerous German Sinto groups that were to follow such as those of Häns'che Weiss, Titi Winterstein, the Hot Club da Sinti and others, also the next generation of great players such as Lulu Reinhardt, Wedeli Köhler and Martin Weiss.

<doc id="54808723" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54808723" title="Punta Lava Lighthouse">
Punta Lava Lighthouse

Punta Lava Lighthouse () is an active 20th century Spanish <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a> on the <a href="Canary%20island">Canary island</a> of <a href="La%20Palma">La Palma</a>. It is located in the municipality of <a href="Tazacorte">Tazacorte</a>, near the village of La Bombilla on the western side of the island. The larger settlement of Puerto Naos lies 2 kilometres to the south-west.

It is one of four main lighthouses on La Palma, each one marking a different cardinal point of the island. The modern lighthouses of Punta Lava and <a href="Arenas%20Blancas%20Lighthouse">Arenas Blancas</a> are located on the western and eastern sides of the island. The older lighthouses at <a href="Punta%20Cumplida%20Lighthouse">Punta Cumplida</a> and <a href="Fuencaliente%20Lighthouse">Fuencaliente</a> are situated at the northern and southern points respectively.

Punta Lava.
The headland of Punta Lava (Lava Point) on which the lighthouse was constructed was formed during the San Juan eruption in 1949. In June of that year, lava flowed from the <a href="Cumbre%20Vieja">Cumbre Vieja</a> at 1300m above sea level down to the Atlantic Ocean, and created a six by three and a half kilometre wide lava platform in the sea. As well as the lighthouse, the headland also contains the village of La Bombilla, a series of large banana plantations and a beach known as Playa Charcon.

The need for the lighthouse on the west coast of the island was identified in the third maritime lighting plan for the Canaries from the 1980s, although initially a light was planned for Punta del Moro some 9 km to the north, near <a href="Los%20Llanos%20de%20Aridane">Los Llanos de Aridane</a>.

Description.
The white octagonal concrete tower, described as a "remarkable modern design", is and was completed in 1993. It first entered service in 1996 and stands on a cliff next to the Atlantic Ocean, about three metres above sea level. This gives the light a focal height of 51m which has a range of 20 nautical miles, and consists of a pattern of three flashes of white light every twenty seconds. In 1998 a new optic was installed, and later the lamps were replaced by sealed beam units.

The lighthouse is operated and maintained by the <a href="port%20authority">port authority</a> of the <a href="province%20of%20Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife">province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife</a>. It is registered under the international number D2851 and has the NGA identifier of 113-23801.

"Old Woman of the Freeway" mural tributes & controversy.
In 1974, <a href="muralist">muralist</a> <a href="Kent%20Twitchell">Kent Twitchell</a> chose a photo of Bronson to use as the model for a huge mural, titled "The Old Woman of the Freeway", to paint on a wall of a <a href="Downtown%20Los%20Angeles">Downtown Los Angeles</a> building which looked down from the Angeles Prince Hotel in <a href="Echo%20Park%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Echo Park</a> onto the <a href="Hollywood%20Freeway">Hollywood Freeway</a>, which depicted Bronson with an Afghan draper around the body in the context of promotional events Cultural level organized by the local county. The mural was then subject to a legal dispute with the owners of the building that first brought it to cover in 1986 and then to a partial restoration that began in 1992. 

In early 2016, after years of legal wrangling amidst offers from numerous vending suitors, Twitchell was finally successful in getting Los Angeles Valley College to approve and agreement to repaint his original "Lady of the Freeway" mural, with a $180,000 offer to recreate her courtesy of a voter-approved community colleges bond-building program. 

The original 1974 "Freeway Lady" mural had became victim to neglect by L.A. city officials, as a garage was built to obscure Bronson's bottom half and then a billboard company had whitewashed the image in 1986. Then, in 1995, while being repainted after a legal settlement, L.A.’s taggers killed off the Freeway Lady project with graffiti.

In 1994, a plan to rehang the mural outside the Valley Institute of Visual Art in <a href="Sherman%20Oaks%2C%20California">Sherman Oaks, California</a> had died when a property owner refused to allow the Twitchell access.

As a cricketer, he was a right-handed tail-end batsman and a left-arm bowler: sources disagree about whether he was a fast bowler or a medium-paced one, but agree that he bowled in the <a href="roundarm%20bowling">round-arm</a> style. He played in three matches for Cambridge University in 1868 as "E. E. Harrison" without making much impact, and was then not picked for any first-team games at all in 1869. He returned to the university team in 1870 and took seven wickets in his first game, against MCC. That led to his selection for the 1870 <a href="University%20Match%20%28cricket%29">University Match</a> against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>, a game that has been widely known as "Cobden's Match" through the feat of the Cambridge bowler <a href="Frank%20Cobden">Frank Cobden</a>, who took the last three Oxford wickets in three balls – a <a href="hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-trick</a> – to win the game for Cambridge by just two runs. Ward was just as influential in the Cambridge victory, his six wickets for 29 in the Oxford second innings, in 32 four-ball overs, being the best bowling performance of his first-class cricket career. He returned to the Cambridge side in 1871, but was less effective, and the University Match of that year, in which he failed to take any wickets, was his last first-class match. He later played minor cricket for <a href="Suffolk%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Suffolk County Cricket Club</a>.

Ward graduated from <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in 1872 and in the same year he was ordained as a <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> <a href="deacon">deacon</a>, becoming a priest two years later. He had a highly itinerant clerical career, serving parishes in Sussex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Northumberland, Yorkshire and Staffordshire, retiring in 1931.

Kuno clan

The was a <a href="Japanese%20clan">Japanese samurai clan</a> who were a prominent <a href="Jizamurai">Jizamurai</a> (国人 "kokujin") family of <a href="T%C5%8Dt%C5%8Dmi%20Province">Tōtōmi Province</a> during the <a href="Muromachi%20period">Muromachi period</a> and <a href="Sengoku%20period">Sengoku period</a>. They first served the <a href="Imagawa%20clan">Imagawa clan</a> (今川氏) for generations but later became retainers of <a href="Tokugawa%20Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>. The surname is sometimes written as "久努", "久奴" or "久能".

Origins.
Early in the Kamakura Period, Kuno Munenaka (久野宗仲) moved to Kuno, <a href="T%C5%8Dt%C5%8Dmi%20Province">Tōtōmi Province</a> and took the place name as his surname founding the Kuno clan. There are several different genealogies of the Kuno clan and it is unknown which is the correct one. In most cases they descend from the <a href="Nanke%20%28Fujiwara%29">Southern House</a> of the <a href="Fujiwara%20clan">Fujiwara clan</a> (藤原南家 "Fujiwara Nanke").

Fujiwara Nanke.
The Kuno clan of <a href="T%C5%8Dt%C5%8Dmi%20Province">Tōtōmi Province</a> was a branch of the Kudō clan (工藤氏) which descended from the Southern House of the <a href="Fujiwara%20clan">Fujiwara clan</a> (藤原南家 "Fujiwara Nanke"). The founder of Fujiwara's Southern House was <a href="Fujiwara%20no%20Muchimaro">Fujiwara no Muchimaro</a> (680–737). His fifth generation great-grandson, Fujiwara no Tamenori (藤原為憲), founded the Kudō clan. In this genealogy the founder of the Kuno clan, Kuno Munenaka (久野宗仲), is a son of Kudō Kiyonaka (工藤清仲).

Hata clan.
Another theory is that the Kuno are descendants of the <a href="Hata%20clan">Hata clan</a> (秦氏), an immigrant family who claimed descent from the first Emperor of China, <a href="Qin%20Shi%20Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a>. 

Another theory.
In the "Seishi-kakei-daijiten" (姓氏家系大辞典) family compilation it is in fact recorded that the Kuno clan descend from Kuno Nao (久奴直).

<doc id="54809714" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54809714" title="Scott's Cheap Flights">
Scott's Cheap Flights

Scott's Cheap Flights is a website service that sends emails to users about cheap airline tickets. It was founded by Scott Keyes and grew due to word of mouth, particularly on <a href="Reddit">Reddit</a>. As of July 1, 2017 it has more than 730,000 subscribers. It has been cited as a quality means by which to find cheap airline tickets, and Scott has been quoted as an authority on the subject.

Concept.
Scott’s Cheap Flights works by monitoring airfare and alerting subscribers when abnormally cheap fares pop up. One type of deal that is listed through the service is called the "fat-finger discount," which refers to discounts that are available because a typographical error was made in the price. Two other deals are due to conversion errors and dated technology. Scott’s Cheap Flights serves the following regions: the United States and Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean, the UK and Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, and New Zealand.

History.
Scott's Cheap Flights was created by Scott Keyes in late 2013 as a personal hobby to alert his friends when cheap fares arose. It gained prominence in 2015 thanks to a Business Insider report in 2015, which lead to his email newsletter going from 300 subscribers to 3000. After the increase in subscribers, Keyes transformed the email list from a hobby to a business. This service launched on August 23, 2015, and after three months, he had generated in excess of $6000. He would later earn a total of $24,376 from 1,687. As of November 2016, Scott had earned $963,234.48 and had 233,660 subscribers (of which 29,639 of them are paid). As of April 2017, the subscriber base has grown to more than 424,000. According to Scott, he only spent $500 on marketing. He cited the success of his business being caused by word-of-mouth, particularly through <a href="Reddit">Reddit</a>. Scott explains that another part of his success is airlines' reluctance to create bad <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> with customers. As such, they honor these tickets instead of potentially being on the wrong end of a <a href="social%20media">social media</a> campaign. He claims that airlines refuse to honor about "one in 10."

Reception.
Scott Keyes and his website have been the subject of media coverage, including an interview with "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>". The website has also been covered in a number of travel blogs, including "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>", which called it "one of the best" newsletters for finding cheap fares. Scott Keyes was quoted by Travel and Leisure in the <a href="United%20Express%20Flight%203411%20incident">United Express Flight 3411 incident</a>, claiming that the average price of <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> tickets had dropped following this incident. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" writer Jonnelle Marte included Scott's Cheap Flights in her list of the best deal tracking tools. She specifically cited it as a good choice if a traveler cared more about travel than the destination. Another "The Washington Post" writer, Jen Ruiz, included it in her list of ways she gets cheap travel deals. She claimed that the newsletter worked better than any flight tracker app she had tried. A writer for the website Cartography & Cloture compared Scott's Cheap Flights with Airfare Watchdogs. In it, they note that both services offered a lot of the same deals, but each had deals the other did not. They also noted that Scott's Cheap Flights had a better social media presence and that both their tweets and emails were easier to understand than Airfare Watchdogs. They suggested that casual fliers or people who tend to fly domestically may prefer Airfare Watchdogs, but that more hardcore fliers or international fliers may prefer Scott's Cheap Flights.

A. Cecil Edwards

Arthur Cecil Edwards (1881 – 1953 or 1957) was a dealer in and authority on <a href="Persian%20carpets">Persian carpets</a>. He was managing director of the <a href="Oriental%20Carpet%20Manufacturers">Oriental Carpet Manufacturers</a> based in Turkey.

Early life and family.
Arthur Edwards was born in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1881 to Charles Reed Edwards (born London) and Louise Baker (born Constantinople). In 1909, Edwards married the American <a href="Clara%20Cary%20Case">Clara Cary Case</a> in Paris Hill, United States. Their son Arthur was born in 1918 in <a href="Hamadan">Hamadan</a>, Iran.

Career.
Edwards's uncle, James Baker, was one of the founders of the <a href="Oriental%20Carpet%20Manufacturers">Oriental Carpet Manufacturers</a> (OCM) in <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a>, today's Izmir, in 1907/8. The company bought and produced Persian carpets for export to the United Kingdom.

As an OCM employee, Edwards moved to <a href="Hamadan">Hamadan</a>, north-western, in 1911, where he built and managed his own carpet production for the company. He and his wife were fascinated by Persian culture. In 1923, they left Iran, traveled to Pakistan for a few months, and finally went to London. There Edwards took over the management of the OCM and expanded its business activities in the United States. He also oversaw the outsourcing of carpet production to India in order to reduce production costs. During the Second World War the family moved to Oxford and then returned to London.

His masterwork was "The Persian Carpet" (1953), published posthumously and repeatedly reissued. The monograph is still one of the standard works on the Persian carpet. It describes in detail the production, colors, patterns and the stylistic development of the Persian knotted carpet in the different provinces of Iran, as well as the history of the regions, their carpet production, number of looms and production figures since the end of the 19th to the middle of the 20th century, and gives an outlook on the future of the carpet industry under the influence of the European market. It was positively reviewed in "<a href="The%20Burlington%20Magazine">The Burlington Magazine</a>" who praised it for its up to date and detailed treatment of the weavers then working in Persia.

Death and legacy.
The drafts of chapters for "The Persian Carpet" are held by the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victorian and Albert Museum</a> in London. In August 2017 the book was still described in "The Times" as "an invaluable aid to carpet dealers".

La Perla (literally "The Pearl") is a 1518-1520 oil on canvas painting by <a href="Giulio%20Romano">Giulio Romano</a>, based on a drawing by <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>.

Church of the Ascension, Belgrade

Church of the Ascension () is a <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox">Serbian Orthodox</a> church in downtown <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, the capital of <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. It still uses the bell under which the <a href="Hatisheriff">Hatisheriff</a> of 1830 was announced, by which the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> granted autonomy to Serbia. The church was declared a <a href="cultural%20monument">cultural monument</a> in 1969.

Location.
The church is located in the municipality of <a href="Savski%20Venac">Savski Venac</a>. The church complex occupies the entire block bounded by the streets of <a href="Kneza%20Milo%C5%A1a%20street">Kneza Miloša</a> (east), "Kraljice Natalije" (north), "Dobrinjska" (west) and "Admirala Geprata" (south), where the church is officially situated, at No. 19. Notable buildings in the nearest vicinity include the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Finance%20%28Serbia%29">Building of the Finance Ministry</a> on the south, the <a href="Hammam%20of%20Prince%20Milo%C5%A1">Hammam of Prince Miloš</a> on the southwest (both across the "Admirala Geprata") and <a href="Beogra%C4%91anka">Beograđanka</a> on the east, across the "Kneza Miloša".

History.
As Belgrade developed in the first half of the 19th century, after the liberation from the Ottomans, <a href="St.%20Mark%27s%20Church%2C%20Belgrade">St. Mark's Church, Belgrade</a> in the neighborhood of <a href="Ta%C5%A1majdan">Tašmajdan</a> became too small to accommodate the growing number of adherents, especially those from the distant neighborhoods on the slopes above the <a href="Sava">Sava</a> river. Additionally, a military complex was built in the area (academy, barracks) so the new church was needed for both the soldiers (who used the tent-church) and the population.

Order for construction of the church was given by <a href="Milo%C5%A1%20Obrenovi%C4%87">Miloš Obrenović</a>, <a href="Prince%20of%20Serbia">Prince of Serbia</a>, and Mihailo II Jovanović, <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Belgrade">Metropolitan of Belgrade</a>, in 1860. Church was completed by 1863, mostly from the citizens' donations. As prince Miloš died in 1860, his son and heir, <a href="Mihailo%20Obrenovi%C4%87">Mihailo Obrenović</a>, continued the consultations with the metropolitan on the new church. It was consecrated by the Metropolian Mihailo II in March 1863. The <a href="clergy%20house">clergy house</a> has been added in 1870 and was renovated in 2013.

Below the churchyard was one of Belgrade's <a href="air%20raid%20shelter">air raid shelter</a>s. During the <a href="Operation%20Retribution%20%281941%29">German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941</a>, bombs directly hit the churchyard, killing 200 people. A memorial marble cross commemorating the victims was built in the 1970s. It was also hit during the bombing of Belgrade by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> in 1944.

In April 2013, almost all trees in the churchyard were cut. Over 50 years old, tall chestnut, black locust and lime trees, were inspected as, for some time, the branches were falling off, even on the parking outside of the churchyard. The communal inspection decided that the trees were rotten and had to be cut down.

Architecture.
After the prince and the metropolitan agreed with the plan for the future church, developed by Pavle Stanišić and Jovan Ristić, city administration announced a bidding for the construction company. The job was awarded to Josif Štok, for the value of 5,000 Austrian <a href="ducats">ducats</a>. Contractors were Fridrih Šlajsner and Ernest Glajzner, while the head of the construction site was Koča Z. Popović. The tin roof was laid by the Schuster company.

It was designed in the prevailing style of the period, the <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>. The church was patterend after the old Serbian monasteries, especially the <a href="Ravanica">Ravanica</a>.

The church is known for its stairs, made from black Hungarian marble. The façade has been done in 1870 and was renovated in 2013.

Characteristics.
The <a href="iconostas">iconostas</a> and wall paintings were originally painted by Nikola Marković. They were later changed. Stevan Todorović has redone the icons in 1880-81 while the <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es on the walls and under the dome are work of <a href="Andrej%20Bicenko">Andrej Bicenko</a>, who finished the work in 1937. The frescoes were refreshed in the early 2000s which made them visible again cause they were black due to the candle smoke, while the icons and iconostas have been conserved in 2006. The original, wooden <a href="bell%20tower">bell tower</a>, collapsed on the <a href="bell-ringer">bell-ringer</a> boy and the new one was built in the 1940s.

One of the bells is the one under which the Hatisheriff of 1830 was announced, in <a href="Ta%C5%A1majdan">Tašmajdan</a>. By the Hatisheriff, the Ottoman Empire officially granted autonomy for Serbia, basically acknowledging the situation which existed sine the <a href="Second%20Serbian%20Uprising">Second Serbian Uprising</a> in 1815. By the additional "berat", the sultan also granted hereditary rights to prince Miloš. The bell was first kept in the <a href="Cathedral%20Church%20of%20St.%20Michael%20the%20Archangel">Cathedral Church of St. Michael the Archangel</a>. It is still used, though it has been adapted so is now operated by the electrical mechanism.

Built partially because of the military complex, Church of the Ascension served as a military church in both Serbia and, later, <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. As the church is dedicated to the <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Ascension">Feast of the Ascension</a>, called in Serbian "Spasovdan" ("Salvation day"), which is also an official "<a href="slava">slava</a>" of the city of Belgrade, a traditional procession celebrating the day through the city's main streets starts and ends at the Church of the Ascension.

The church has a rich treasury, which includes the collections of icons, old books and <a href="goldwork">goldwork</a>s and other objects from the 19th century.

Paposo or Caleta Paposo is a hamlet in the southern part of <a href="Antofagasta%20Province">Antofagasta Province</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a>. Paposo is on the coast of the <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a> Ocean with the low ridges of the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> a few hundred meters inland. The census of 2002 counted 259 inhabitants.The inhabitants of Paposo rely on fishing and mining for a living.

Paposo is best known for its unusual desert climate and the "fog oases" which exist on mountain slopes a few kilometers inland. In a region almost devoid of vegetation, the fog oases, also called <a href="lomas">lomas</a>, support a variety of flora. 
Geography and climate.
Paposo is located adjacent to a small cove on the coast of the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> in the <a href="Atacama%20desert">Atacama desert</a>, the driest non-polar desert in the world. Vegetation is nearly absent in most of the Atacama. The Andes foothills rise steeply from the sea, reaching an elevation of less than from the coast. 
Paposo and the Atacama have the BWn climate in the <a href="Koppen%20Classification">Koppen Classification</a>, characterized by mild temperatures, unusual in desert climates, and frequent fog, especially in the southern hemisphere winter, rolling in from the nearby ocean. Average temperatures in Paposo range from in July to in January, the warmest month. Annual precipitation is . July is the month with most precipitation with . 

The climatic feature which permits the growth of vegetation on the slopes of the mountains rising above Paposo is the <a href="Garua">Garua</a> or <a href="Camanchaca">Camanchaca</a> -- <a href="cloud">cloud</a> banks caused by the cold waters of the <a href="Humboldt%20Current">Humboldt Current</a> running offshore in the Pacific. Inland, on mountain slopes, the cloud banks form. The camanchaca, as it is called in Chile, is a dense <a href="fog">fog</a> that does not produce <a href="rain">rain</a>. The moisture that makes up the cloud measures between 1 and 40 <a href="microns">microns</a> across, too fine to form rain droplets.

The fog oasis.
Near Paposo the Camanchaca fog impacts elevations from to and up to about inland from the ocean. Elevations between and receive the most moisture from the fog and have the most abundant vegetation. The quebradas (ravines) near Paposo sometimes have running water from higher elevations with greater precipitation.

The fog oasis at Paposo has more plant species than any other fog oasis in Chile, counting at least 250 species of vascular plants.
Wildlife in the fog oasis includes the <a href="guanaco">guanaco</a> and two species of foxes, the <a href="culpeo">culpeo</a> (Andean fox) and the <a href="South%20American%20gray%20fox">South American gray fox</a>.

In 2013, the government of Chile, created the "Natural Monument of North Paposo" (Monumento Natural Paposo Norte) with an area of . The Natural Monument is entered east of the town of Paposo along both sides of highway B-710. The Monument was formerly called the "Reserva Nacional Paposo."

Paranal.
Paposo is the nearest community to the <a href="Paranal%20Observatory">Paranal Observatory</a>, the second largest observatory in the world. The observatory is located on <a href="Paranal">Paranal</a> mountain about in straight-line distance north of Paposo. The observatory is located about from the sea and at an altitude of , thus outside the area influenced by the Camanchaca fog.

Perla di Modena

The Perla of Modena (literally, "the Pearl of Modena") is an oil on panel painting, dated to 1518-1520 and now attributed to <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>. It is now in the <a href="Galleria%20Estense">Galleria Estense</a> in <a href="Modena">Modena</a>.

History.
The painting remained in the Galleria's store-rooms for a long time in a very ornate frame topped by an eagle (the <a href="d%27Este">d'Este</a> family crest, also seen on the frames of several works from its collection which are now in the <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%20Alte%20Meister">Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>). It which drew the curiosity of soprintendente Mario Scalini, who decided to send it to the Florentine restorer Lisa Venerosi Pesciolini and to Art-Test Firenze. The restorer studied and scientifically anaylsed the work, finding a remarkable quality of painting and under-drawing beneath the surface, including a preparatory drawing which supports the theory that the work is by Raphael himself.

It demonstrated the work to be identical with the head of the Virgin from "<a href="La%20Perla%20%28painting%29">La Perla</a>" (now in the <a href="Prado">Prado</a>), once thought to be a late work by Raphael but now thought to be by <a href="Giulio%20Romano">Giulio Romano</a> based on drawings by Raphael. This identification of the Modena work was based on the eagle on the frame, on the mention of a "woman's head" by Raphael in a 1663 inventory of the d'Este art collections and on the halo behind the head. It probably formed an initial version of "La Perla" before being abandoned due to flaws in the panel. The work also allows us to see how 17th century painters in <a href="Emilia-Romagna">Emilia-Romagna</a> referred to this head and to that of Raphael's "<a href="The%20Ecstasy%20of%20St.%20Cecilia%20%28Raphael%29">Saint Cecelia</a>" in their elaboration of classicism.

On 7 August 2017, a truck carrying explosive material accidentally went off at Band Road in <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>, <a href="Punjab%2C%20Pakistan">Punjab</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. As a result of explosion, two people were killed while 35 people were wounded. <a href="Tehreek-i-Taliban%20Pakistan">Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan</a> is suspected to have perpetrated the attack.

Background.
<a href="Lahore">Lahore</a> have been the victim of many terrorist incidents in 2017. The current attack came two weeks after <a href="July%202017%20Lahore%20suicide%20bombing">a suicide bombing</a> that claimed 26 lives, followed by <a href="April%202017%20Lahore%20suicide%20bombing">a blast</a> targeting a census team in April and <a href="February%202017%20Lahore%20suicide%20bombing">a bombing</a> that killed 13 people in February.

Intelligence before the attack.
According to a <a href="http%3A//e.dunya.com.pk/detail.php%3Fdate%3D2017-08-01%26amp%3Bedition%3DLHR%26amp%3Bid%3D3279215_92441688">news article</a> published in <a href="Daily%20Dunya">Daily Dunya</a> on 1st August, law enforcement agencies had diligently informed the <a href="Inspector%20General">Inspector General</a> of the Punjab police, Arif Nawaz about the details and specific locations of the highly possible terror attacks.

The agencies passed on information that there were several facilitators and groups of banned outfits near fruit markets who were actively transporting explosive materials, weapons, suicide jackets and timing devices via trucks and secretly occupying several buildings where they plan terror activities, the report stated.

Warning the police officials, the agencies said that the checkpoints near the fruit markets were not doing enough to ensure safety and security. The agencies directed them to carry out intelligence-based and combing operations in and around the target areas so that those who want to carry out the attacks in Punjab cannot do so easily.

Explosion.
At around 20:50 <a href="Pakistan%20Standard%20Time">UTC+5:00</a>, a truck loaded with fruit, accidentally exploded, killing two and injuring 35 people. Injuries were caused by debris of the building that collapsed as a result of explosion. More than 100 vehicles near the explosion were also damaged. The roof of a nearby school collapsed. The explosion caused damage to an electrical transformer and consequently the electrical supply was suspended and the area of the explosion was darkened. People initially thought that the electrical transformer had exploded. The explosion left a 10 foot crater on the ground. Parts of the truck were found several hundred meters away from the site of the explosion.

Aftermath.
As the explosion occurred about 300 meters away from <a href="Rescue%201122">Rescue 1122</a>'s headquarter, Rescue 112 teams began to take the injured to Mian Munshi Hospital and Moyo Hospital. Security officials cordoned off the area. The Bomb Disposal Squad reached the site and discovered that 80 kilograms of <a href="explosive%20material">explosive material</a> was used.

Following the attack, the <a href="Counter%20Terrorism%20Department">Counter Terrorism Department</a> (CTD) teams began their search operation. A few hours after the attack, a clash erupted between 7 terrorists and the CTD team in which 4 terrorists were shot dead while 3 others managed to flee in the dark. The terrorists were identified as <a href="Tehreek-i-Taliban%20Pakistan">Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan</a>'s militants.

Reactions.
<a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20Punjab%2C%20Pakistan">CM Punjab</a>, <a href="Shehbaz%20Sharif">Shehbaz Sharif</a> condemned the attack and directed the authorities to investigate the explosion.

Husted v. Randolph Institute

Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, No. 16-980, is a case pending before the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>. At issue is whether 52 U.S.C. § 20507 permits Ohio's list-maintenance process, which uses a registered voter's voter inactivity as a reason to send a confirmation notice to that voter under the <a href="National%20Voter%20Registration%20Act%20of%201993">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a> and the <a href="Help%20America%20Vote%20Act">Help America Vote Act</a> of 2002.

Facts and prior history.
Ohio law provides a process to remove a voter from the rolls if she does not vote. After a two-year break from voting, the state sends her a confirmation notice. If the voter does not respond to that notice and does not vote over the next four years, Ohio removes her from the list of registered voters. The voter must register anew.

The <a href="A.%20Philip%20Randolph%20Institute">A. Philip Randolph Institute</a>, a labor and civil rights group, originally filed this lawsuit against Ohio’s secretary of state, <a href="Jon%20A.%20Husted">Jon A. Husted</a> alleging that this process violates the <a href="National%20Voter%20Registration%20Act%20of%201993">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a>, which bars states from removing someone from the voter registration list for not voting and sets out a process for states to remove voters who have moved away. The state prevailed in federal district court. The <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Sixth%20Circuit">U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit</a> reversed. It concluded that, although federal law allows Ohio to remove voters who did not either respond to the confirmation notice or vote in two elections, the state’s process uses the failure to vote as the basis for initiating removal, which is not authorized by federal law.

Latest developments and next steps.
On May 30, 2017, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in the autumn.

He was a paternalistic and well-liked employer, concerned about his workers' health and welfare.
After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–18) he was accused of the war crime of destroying French factories.
Although he was acquitted, his French property was not returned, and he became deeply hostile to France.
He was a Pan-German nationalist and strongly antisemitic.
After the accession of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> he became an influential member of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>.
During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> (1939–45) he was made responsible for coordination of the iron and steel industry in occupied Lorraine, and later in the whole of Germany and the occupied territories.
He used prisoners of war for forced labor in the steel works.
After the war he was tried and convicted for human rights violations, although as an old man he was released before serving his full term.

Early years (1872–1914).
Hermann Röchling was born on 12 November 1872 in <a href="Saarbr%C3%BCcken">Saarbrücken</a> and baptized on 28 December 1872 in Alt-Saarbrücken. 
His parents were <a href="Carl%20R%C3%B6chling">Carl Röchling</a> (1827–1910), a major industrialist, and Alwine Vopelius (1837–1918).
In 1891 he passed his "Reifeprüfung" at the Ludwigs Gymnasium in Saarbrücken.
Hermann Röchling received practical training at the Hüttenwerken in <a href="Peine">Peine</a> and at the Ilseder Hütte.
He studied at the universities in <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> and <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, at the Technical University of the Bergakademie and at the Agricultural College.
He returned to <a href="V%C3%B6lklingen">Völklingen</a> in October 1895 where he received further practical training.
He served for one year in 7th Dragoon Regiment in Saarbrücken.
In the spring of 1897 he went on a study trip to North America.

Carl Röchling, Hermann's father, was head of what would become the <a href="R%C3%B6chling%20Group">Röchling Group</a>.
By 1896 Carl Röchling and his children owned more than 50% of the company.
Hermann Röchling was Carl Röchling's seventh son, but due to his technical and commercial talent became the patriarch of the family firm.
He was supported by a number of brothers and cousins.
In August 1897 Hermann Röchling oversaw construction of a new Carlshütte kiln plant in Diedenhofen (<a href="Thionville">Thionville</a>) in Lorraine.
In 1898 he took over management of the <a href="V%C3%B6lklingen%20Ironworks">Völklingen Ironworks</a> ("Völklinger Hütte").
On 10 August 1899 in <a href="Metz">Metz</a> he married Theodora Müller (1878–1946).
They had two children, Ellenruth (1900–1977), and Carl Theodor (1902–44).

The Völklinger iron and steel mill is only a few kilometers from the border with France, in a region where international borders have often been disputed, and became an important military-industrial complex.
In 1900 the iron works employed 6,000 people.
Hermann Röchling directed the plant in Thionville until 1905, when his brother Robert took over.
In 1907 Hermann Röchling became the director of the Völklingen Ironworks.
Carl Röchling died in Saarbrücken in 1910.
Hermann Röchling continued to build his stake in the company.
He also supported the Evangelical Church and various social organizations and charities.
The Röchlings were known for treating their employees well.
Hermann Röchling was paternalistic, concerned about the health of the workers and their wives and children.
He built a hospital for the ironworks.

World War I (1914–18).
From 1914 to 1915 Hermann Röchling was <a href="Rittmeister">Rittmeister</a> of the 7th Dragoon Regiment.
He was a nationalist, and during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–18) he advocated westward expansion of the German Reich.
The Völklingen Ironworks provided 90% of the special steel used for army helmets.
The Völklingen plant also made two sizes of shells for the German army and navy.
In 1918 Herrmann Röchling was appointed a Royal Prussian "Kommerzienrat".
He and his cousin Robert were charged with destroying several factories in the northeast of France when they were evacuated by German troops.
His efficiency in carrying out the order later caused much trouble.

Inter-War period (1918–39).
After the war, Hermann Röchling was a member of the armistice commission.
The firm resumed steel manufacture.
The higher quality steel was molten in Röchling Rodenhauser electric furnaces, which Röchling had helped design, and was used for tools, cutlery and surgical instruments.
The company also made steel for construction.
The coal was mined locally, while iron ore was imported from Lorraine, France.

In 1919 France accused the brothers Robert and Hermann Röchling of the war crimes of serious theft and damage.
On 23 December 1919 the council of war in <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a> condemned them to 10 years imprisonment, a 10 million franc fine and exile from Saarland.
The family's assets in France were seized, with nominal compensation of about 5% of the value.
Hermann Röchling, who was living <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>, escaped imprisonment.
Rochling devoted himself to intense anti-French propaganda while in Heidelberg.
The judgement was annulled in cassation, and a new trial was started by the council of war of <a href="Nancy%2C%20France">Nancy</a>.
The Rochlings argued that since they had simply executed orders given by the German High Command they should not be prosecuted, and on 12 October 1920 an order ruled in their favour.
However, Hermann could not obtain a pardon from the French government until 18 May 1942, which increased his resentment of France.
He was able to return to the Saar after the sentence was repealed.
In 1920 Hermann Röchling founded the Röchling-Buderus steelworks in <a href="Wetzlar">Wetzlar</a>.
In 1922 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the <a href="Heidelberg%20University">Heidelberg University</a>.
During the occupation of the Saar from 1922 to 1935 Hermann Röchling was an elected representative of the people on the Advisory Council of the Saar Territory, first representing the Liberal Volkspartie, then after this party joined with the Democrats representing the Deutsche Saarlindischer Volkspartie.
Rochling welcomed the arrival of Hitler in power, which promised a triumph of his Pan-German ideas.
He was glad to see the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> dismantled and welcomed a war that would allow him to take final revenge on France.

Röchling met <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in 1933 and promoted formation of the "German Front" in the Saar at Hitler's suggestion.
After the expiry of the League of Nations mandate over the Saar in 1935, Hermann Röchling committed himself to the return of Saarland to Germany.
Röchling was violently antisemitic, and when the Nazis temporarily reduced their attacks on Jews before the January 1935 plebiscite on the return he protested that the Saar risked turning into a "Jewish nature reserve".
Röchling joined the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> in 1935.
In 1935 he was appointed to the Reich's Armament Advisory Board (Rustungsbeirat).
Hermann Röchling was a confidant of Hitler, who valued his knowledge of industry. 
Röchling wrote several memoranda for Hitler.
In his "Thoughts on the Preparation for the War and Its Implementation" in August 1936 he urged Hitler to declare war on the Soviet Union.

As of 1936 Hermann Röchling and his two children, Karl Theodor (1902–1944) and Ellenruth (1900–1977), owned 18% of the company shares.
Röchling also sat on the boards on many mining companies.
He was a senator of the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Society">Kaiser Wilhelm Society</a>.
On 30 January 1938 Hermann Röchling was appointed a military economist by <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> (1893–1946).
As "<a href="Wehrwirtschaftsf%C3%BChrer">Wehrwirtschaftsführer</a>" (defense economy leader) he headed the "South West District of the steel industry economic grouping".

World War II (1939–45).
After the defeat of France Röchling was made appointed General Manager of Iron and Steel for the Lorraine and Meurthe-de-Moselle regions, excluding <a href="Longwy">Longwy</a>, on 1 July 1940, and held this post until 1942.
In a letter to Hitler of 15 July 1940 Röchling advocated annexation of <a href="Moselle%20%28department%29">Moselle</a> and <a href="Meurthe-et-Moselle">Meurthe-et-Moselle</a> to Germany.
French elements would be expelled and Germans introduced, mainly from the Saar.
Göring decreed that the Moselle factories were to be divided into three groups: those restored to their former owners, those handed to the <a href="Reichswerke%20Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Reichswerke Hermann Göring</a>, and those handed over to Friedrich Flick A.G.. Rochling protested strongly but was overruled.
For example, the Wendel steelworks in Lorraine had been occupied by German troops on 16 June 1940.
<a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Wendel">François</a> and <a href="Humbert%20de%20Wendel">Humbert de Wendel</a> were given permits to travel to <a href="Hayange">Hayange</a>, where they were shown an authorization by Göring on 12 July 1940 for Röchling to take control of the works. The Wendels were forced to leave Lorraine on 48 hours notice.
Röchling pledged to destroy the Wendel family interests.
He wanted to separate the Wendel factories at <a href="Hayange">Hayange</a>, <a href="Moyeuvre-Grande">Moyeuvre-Grande</a> and <a href="J%C5%93uf">Jœuf</a>, and annex the Hayange plant to his Carlshütte in Thionville. 
However, in December 1940 Paul Raabe warned him that in the end Göring would assign the spoils of the Wendel family to his own firm.
After Göring's allocation of the industrial plants, in January 1941 Hermann Röchling was relieved of control in Moselle, retaining only Meurthe-et-Moselle.
In 1941 he became president of the Metz Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
By the spring of 1942 Röchling saw the struggle in Russia as a trial between Capitalism and Communism, and was concerned at the success of the Soviets in supplying aircraft and tanks to their forces.
He supported the antisemitic and imperialist policies of the Nazis, but shared with Speer a deep concern over the Nazi's confused attacks on "plutocrats".
He disagreed with the state-controlled approach of the Reichswerke Hermann Göring and wanted to prove that private enterprise, left to organize itself without interference and allowed to make profits, was the best way to supply the armed forces with what they needed.

In March 1942 Röchling wrote to Hitler, "The steel industry of Lorraine and Luxembourg is not being exploited at even 30 percent of capacity, that of Meurthe-et-Moselle and Longwy at not even 20 percent, and that of Belgium-North France at only 30 percent.
In 1942 Speer proposed to form a Reich Iron Association (RVE) to cut through the confusion of competing interests in the iron and steel industry, controlling everything from raw material to sales, and proposed <a href="Albert%20V%C3%B6gler">Albert Vögler</a> of United Steel as head.
However, Hitler preferred Röchling, and on 29 May 1942 Speer appointed him chairman of the RVE.
Röchling had the power to do everything necessary to double production of steel.
He ordered the western European steel manufacturers to accept his orders without question, even if this led them to ruin.
They could not comply except in the short term because of the shortage of coal.

On 18 June 1942 Röchling was also given charge of the iron and steel industry in the occupied territories at the recommendation of Goering.
Röchling, <a href="Alfried%20Krupp%20von%20Bohlen%20und%20Halbach">Alfried Krupp</a> and <a href="Walter%20Rohland">Walter Rohland</a> now had almost absolute power over heavy industry.
The Reich Iron Association held its first presidium meeting in August 1942, attended by Röchling, Krupp, Rohland, <a href="Friedrich%20Flick">Friedrich Flick</a>, <a href="Wilhelm%20Zangen">Wilhelm Zangen</a>, <a href="Paul%20Pleiger">Paul Pleiger</a> and Alfred Pott as well as representatives from the <a href="German%20Labour%20Front">German Labour Front</a> and from Saxony and Austria.
On his 70th birthday on 12 November 1942, Röchling received the <a href="Adlerschild%20des%20Deutschen%20Reiches">Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches</a> (Eagle Shield of the German Reich), a reward for the civil personalities of the Third Reich.
Röchling's crash program drained industrial reserves of coal, and in 1943 the problem worsened as coal miners went on strike, shortages developed in mining material such as pit props, and Allied bombing raids increased in preparation for the landings in Normandy.
Speer was unable to revive industrial production.
The concept of the <a href="V-3%20cannon">V-3 cannon</a>, a gun barrel that would fire a long dart-shaped shell, originated with <a href="August%20Coenders">August Coenders</a>, a machine gun engineer and developer of the <a href="R%C3%B6chling%20shell">Röchling shell</a> who worked for Hermann Roechling.
The idea was to reduce London to rubble by continuous rapid fire of these shells.
Work on the V3 started in 1942 and in 1943 Roechling persuaded Speer to give the project his backing.
A huge emplacement was built near <a href="Moyecques">Moyecques</a> in the Pays de Calais using German workers, prisoners of war and slave labourers.
Test firings in January 1944 were not promising and later that year the project was abandoned.

During the war the Röchlings used prisoners of war to work their steel mills, and both tolerated and encouraged inhumane conditions and harsh punishments.
On 17 December 1944 Hermann Roechling's son Carl Theodor was assassinated in Völklingen.
The military occupation of the Saar by American troops began on 20 March 1945.

Post-World War II (1945–55).
After the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> Röchling was interrogated during the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg trials</a> in June 1945.
In November 1946 he was arrested by the Allies, and in May 1947 was transferred to France.
His trial at the International Military Court in <a href="Rastatt">Rastatt</a> began on 16 February 1948 for crimes against humanity.
In the same trial his cousin Ernst Röchling, his son-in-law Hans Lothar Gemmingen-Hornberg and two associates were tried.
Among other things, Hermann Rochling was accused of urging Hitler to invade the Balkans so as to appropriate the Balkan enterprises.
The indictment stated that, "[i]f the 'Directors of German Enterprises'... plead that they only attached themselves to Hitler in order to oppose communism or 'Social Democracy', there exists no doubt that the profound reason for their attitude can be sought in their desire, long before the coming of national socialism, to extend their undertakings beyond the frontiers of the Reich."

At his trial in Nuremberg in June 1946 Speer has said that he and Hermann Röchling had resisted demands by Hitler to use violence in disciplining French labour and to abandon "humanitarian muddle-headedness" in dealing with saboteurs.
Humbert de Wendell stated in an affidavit that he considered, "the defendent a pan-Germanist of the old school, who gave total support to Hitler because he saw in him a man capable of achieving the 'Deutshland über Alles!'. But [Röchling] did not swallow all the stupidity of the Nazi Party. ... He was a man of the Reichswehr [sic] but not the Gestapo."
De Wendell said Röchling had resisted the expulsion of French personnel by Gauleiter <a href="Josef%20B%C3%BCrckel">Josef Bürckel</a>, had stopped the Gestapo from placing their agents in the factories, had often intervened on behalf of French employees with the police and had appointed excellent German administrators.

A revised sentence of conviction was published on 2 July 1948.
Hermann Röchling was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes against humanity, and Gemmingen-Hornberg received a three year sentence.
Ernst Röchling was acquitted.
The Völklingen Ironworks was placed under sequestration by the French State after the June 1948 trial, but this did not give the French state legal ownership.
After an appeal, on 25 January 1949 the Supreme Court of the French Military Government in the French Zone of Occupation acquitted Hermann Röchling of waging aggressive wars.
It made this ruling since the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg had dismissed Speer from this charge.
However, it sentenced him to ten years imprisonment for the other charges. 
The court also reversed the acquittal of Ernst Röchling and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment.
All the property of the convicted men was confiscated and they lost their civil rights.

On 18 August 1951 Röchling was given a conditional discharge.
He remarried on 20 August 1951 in <a href="K%C3%B6nigsfeld%20im%20Schwarzwald">Königsfeld</a>, Swabia to Ruth Huesgen (1885–1973).
In 1952 he received the <a href="Werner%20von%20Siemens%20Ring">Werner von Siemens Ring</a>, one of the highest German honors awarded in the field of technical sciences.
In 1953 he received the <a href="Rudolf-Diesel-Medaille">Rudolf-Diesel-Medaille</a>.
In April 1955 the French and German governments bought Völklingen from the Rochling family for 200 million Swiss francs.
By this time he was viewed as something of a martyr in Saarland, since he had always treated his employees well, and it was rumoured that the government had cheated him.

Hermann Röchling died on 24 August 1955 in <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a>.
He was buried in the Röchling family vault in Alt-Saarbruecken.
The Völklingen Ironworks was returned to the Röchling family in 1956.
In 1956 a memorial was dedicated to Hermann Röchling in Völklingen, and the district of Hermann Röchling Heights in Völklingen was named after him.
Due to his Nazi past, this was an ongoing source of controversy.
The iron works was later made a UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>.
The genus of the extinct beetle "Rochlingia hitleri" was named after Hermann Röchling by P. Guthörl in 1934.

Schwing Stetter

Schwing Stetter GmbH, headquartered in <a href="Memmingen">Memmingen</a>, <a href="Upper%20Swabia">Upper Swabia</a>, is a manufacturer of <a href="concrete%20mixer">concrete mixer</a>s and concrete transport systems. With over 600 employees at the <a href="Memmingen">Memmingen</a> site, Schwing Stetter is one of the largest employers in the city. In 1982, it was taken over by the company Schwing and integrated into the Group as an independent company. Stetter is currently the world's largest producer of truck mixers.

History.
The head office is located in Memmingen. In 1945, the company Stetter, which specialized in concrete mixers, was developed from a former forge. The first transport concrete mixer on a <a href="Magirus">Magirus</a>-Deutz truck chassis was presented at the <a href="Hannover%20Messe">Hanover Fair</a> in 1958. Through developments such as integrated <a href="Hydraulic%20drive%20system">hydraulic drive</a>, <a href="Direct%20drive%20mechanism">direct drive</a>, special drum shape, design of spirals in the outlet area and integrated oil cooler and filter systems, Stetter GmbH secured an important status in the industry. Already at the end of the sixties, they were the market leader in the branch and more than 50,000 transport mixers were sold between 1958 to 1994. The concrete mixers are built on the chassis of over 15 different vehicle manufacturers in up to 300 different designs. Adaptation to country-specific guidelines and working methods make this diversity necessary.

In 1982, the company was taken over by Schwing. Until this time, Schwing produced construction <a href="winch">winch</a>es, construction <a href="Hydraulic%20hooklift%20hoist">hoists</a>, mobile tower <a href="Crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a>s, universal climbing cranes, earthmoving machines, concrete and mortar mixers and saw a sensible addition to its product range at Stetter GmbH. The company was chosen as a business form. The existing divisions at the Memmingen site were retained and business there was continued as usual. This way, Stetter GmbH retained its own research and development department specifically for the products on the market, the personnel department and its own management.

Products.
The company manufactures concrete mixers, mobile and solid <a href="Concrete%20plant">concrete mixing plants</a> and residual concrete processing plants at the Memmingen plant. Stetter truck mixers are offered in four different classes, BasicLine as standard, LightLine as a particularly low-weight mixer, Heavy DutyLine for heavy duty use and for particularly high loading is the trailer line. With the concrete mixers, the concrete is fully blended in the stated composition and is loaded directly. Due to the increased environmental awareness of the population and industry, for cost reduction and official regulations, it was necessary to develop processing plants for residual concrete.

Branch offices.
In Austria, France, Turkey, Russia, China, India and the USA, branches were established

The Junior University College of <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> was a university college in <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20">Sri Lanka </a>(earlier <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>) from 1969 until 1972. It had several constituent campuses at various locations around <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. In 1972 it was separated into independent Advanced Technological Institute or covert in to another institute .
History.
Foundation and vision.
The concept of the junior college is spreading rapidly throughout the world.The government of <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> established the six Junior University Colleges, in 1969.

Part xvi of the Higher Education Act No. 20 of 1966 provides for the establishment of Junior University Colleges in Ceylon. These are two-year colleges providing courses with a practical bias designed to meet the manpower requirements of the developing nation. The primary aim of the Junior College is the further democratization of education by extending it to beyond the secondary level.

The Junior University Colleges give the higher educational opportunity to many high potential students who were barred from admission to the university system.The JuniorUniversity College strived to meet the manpower needs of both the public and the private sector, emphasizing employment-oriented rather than purely academic education that leads directly to job placement

The idea of a Junior University Colleges of <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> was proposed by the Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs of Ceylon,<a href="%20I.%20M.%20R.%20A.%20Iriyagolla"> I. M. R. A. Iriyagolla</a>In 1965, He visited the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> to study institutions of higher education.Among the institutions visited were the junior colleges of Southern <a href="California">California</a>, was impressed with what he saw and "returned to Ceylon with renewed enthusiasm and determination to provide semi-professional education for his nation"
The junior university colleges system is at the apex of Ceylon's educational reforms. Although many educators and politicians supported the philosophy behind the movement.

Workshops.
Immediately after the appointment of the first group of faculty in the spring of 1968, a series of workshops planned and directed by Charles C.Collins, the first of four scheduled Fulbright professors (1967-68), produced detailed course outlines and developed plans for a comprehensive student personnel services program.The work of Professor Hahn and Dr.Wijeyewardene a decade before was destined to bear fruit. For the first time in the nation's history, the junior university colleges were to be manned by full-time guidance and placement counselors.

History.
Bamboo has hundred of species and grows in large swathes across parts of <a href="east%20Asia">east Asia</a> and <a href="southeast%20Asia">southeast Asia</a> and <a href="south%20Asia">south Asia</a> such as <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>.

More than six hundred species of <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> grow in Japan, including the "<a href="Phyllostachys%20bambusoides">Phyllostachys bambusoides</a>" variety, which can grow to a height of 15–22 m and a diameter of 10–15 cm. Although defined as a subfamily of grasses, bamboo is characterized by its woody <a href="culm">culm</a> and a root system that can form either aggressive runners or thick, slowly spreading clusters. 

Bamboo is a common theme in <a href="Japanese%20literature">Japanese literature</a> and a favoured subject of painters. Along with the evergreen pine and plum, which is the first flower of spring, bamboo is a part of the traditional <a href="Three%20Friends%20of%20Winter">Three Friends of Winter</a>. The three are a symbol of steadfastness, perseverance, and resilience. Japanese artists have often represented bamboo enduring inclement weather, such as rain or snow, reflecting its reputation for being flexible but unbreakable, and its association with steadfastness and loyalty.

Apart from carving bamboo, another important area is <a href="Japanese%20bamboo%20weaving">bamboo weaving</a>. 

Supplemental usage of bamboo in architecture can include scaffolding, windows, walls, fences, and water pipes such as "<a href="shishi-odoshi">shishi-odoshi</a>".

<doc id="54811007" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54811007" title="Cour Carrée">
Cour Carrée

The Cour Carrée is one of the main courtyards of the <a href="Louvre%20Palace">Louvre Palace</a>.

It was built steps by steps as the medieval Louvre castle was progressively demolished.

The steps of a progressive construction.
From 1190 to 1215, <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip-Augustus</a> built the <a href="Wall%20of%20Philip%20II%20Augustus">wall that bears his name</a> around Paris to protect the capital from the English. To reinforce this enclosure on the western side, he built the <a href="Louvre%20castle">Louvre castle</a>, an important fortress with four high walls protected by flooded ditches, towers and a dungeon.

At the time of the King <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V of France</a> (1364-1380), the population increasing, Paris spread widely beyond the walls of Philip-Augustus. The king build <a href="Wall%20of%20Charles%20V">a new enclosure</a> which encompasses these new quarters, and the Louvre castle is now inside this new enclosure. Therefore the castle loses much of its military interest. The king transformed the castle to make it more comfortable with the opening of numerous windows and the addition of chimneys,statues and turrets, creating gardens.

After his return from captivity of two years in Italy and Spain because of the defeat of Pavia (1524), the king <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a>wants to transform the old castle of the Louvre into a palace of <a href="Renaissance%20style">Renaissance style</a> like those he experienced during his captivity. In 1528, he knocked down in four months the "Grosse Tour" (=big tower) which served as a <a href="keep">keep</a> and occupied with his moat the main part of the court of the castle. In 1546, the King asks the architect <a href="Pierre%20Lescot">Pierre Lescot</a> and the sculptor <a href="Jean%20Goujon">Jean Goujon</a> to realize this transformation. His son <a href="Henri%20II%20of%20France">Henri II</a> (1547-1559) continues his work. The west wall is destroyed and rebuilt as a Renaissance palace of the same length from December 1546 to March 1549 : it is the current <a href="Lescot%20Wing">Lescot Wing</a>. It hosts the "hall of the guards", today "salle des caryatides" which is a room for parties and as ballroom. There will historical events in this room such as the marriage of the King <a href="Henri%20IV%20of%20France">Henri IV</a>, an episode of the <a href="St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Day%20massacre">St. Bartholomew's Day massacre</a>, the funeral wake of Henry IV, <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>'s first performance for the King <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a> on the october 16th 1658.
Henry II then destroys and rebuilt the southern wall (1553-1556) with at the corner the creation of the king's pavilion. At this stage, the building is very heterogeneous since two sides are Renaissance-style palaces and the other two remain those of the medieval castle with walls, battlements and towers.

The queen <a href="Catherine%20de%27%20Medici">Catherine de' Medici</a> favores the construction of her <a href="Tuileries%20Palace">Tuileries Palace</a>. And Henry IV privileges his "gallery along the river", that is to say the link between the Louvre and the Tuileries. But he already intends to quadruple the size of the courtyard of the Louvre castle with the extension of the buildings already built.
It is <a href="Louis%20XIII%20of%20France">Louis XIII</a> who destroys the north wall of the castle (1624). The <a href="Lescot%20Wing">Lescot Wing</a> wa built for a court with the size of the one of the castle. It was not easy to integrate it into a courtyard whose sides would be twice as long. The idea of the new architect <a href="Jacques%20Lemercier">Jacques Lemercier</a> is to duplicate this wing to the north : it will be the present "Lemercier Wing" (1636). And to install a pavilion between the two : the <a href="Pavillon%20de%20l%E2%80%99Horloge">Pavillon de l’Horloge</a>, today pavilion Sully.

<a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> knocks down the east wall by the architect Louis Le Vau. The last two walls slaughtered (north and east) were simply shaved and the ditches filled. Their foundations remained intact. This is what will make it possible to rediscover them in the nineteenth century (1866) and to update their base during the works of the <a href="Grand%20Louvre">Grand Louvre</a> : it is the current collection of the <a href="Medieval%20Louvre">Medieval Louvre</a>.

Louis XIV doubles the length of the south wing and build the north wing. Three of the sides of the square yard are then in place. It remains to build the east wing which is important because it faces the city whose houses and buildings are close. It must be the new main entrance to the Louvre. After a contest launched by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Colbert">Jean-Baptiste Colbert</a>, the king decides the construction of the <a href="Perrault%27s%20Colonnade">Perrault's Colonnade</a> on the east side outside [1665] by <a href="Claude%20Perrault">Claude Perrault</a> and <a href="Louis%20le%20Vau">Louis le Vau</a> . The work drags on because it is necessary to buy the land and the houses before the future colonnade to clear the view (the king does not have the power of <a href="expropriation">expropriation</a>). Moreover, the king privileges the <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Palace of Versailles</a> from 1674.

Louis XIV also decided to double the width of the south wing (1670). This is why today we have two series of rooms : on the side of the courtyard side, the rooms of the Charles X museum ; on the side of Seine river, the rooms of the Campana gallery with essentially Greek potteries. But this work of the south wing will not be completed until a century later.

After the departure of the royal court for Versailles, the unfinished buildings host artists. Heterogeneous constructions appear in the courtyard.

After the abandonment and degradation of the Revolution, Louis XVIII restored the Louvre and placed his monogram on the three exterior facades of the cour Carrée (including the colonnade), with his monogram (two L's of stick characters turning their backs) whereas he only restored them.

Description.
The buildings form a square of about 160 meters on each side. They are articulated on eight <a href="Wing%20%28building%29">Wings</a> that punctuate eight <a href="Pavilion">Pavilion</a>s from northwest to west

On either side of the Sully pavilion there are:

At the center of this courtyard there is a fountain.
Although the buildings were built over a period of 250 years, they show great homogeneity. The ground floor and the two storeys have successions of windows, bas-reliefs, statues in niches. The sovereigns wanted to leave their monogram on the parts they built. It is thus that we find those of Henri II, Charles IX, Henri IV, Louis XIII and Louis XIV. This helps to track the history of construction.

The Republic did not want to be outdone and installed a rooster in the fronton of the central wing of the east wing.

Example of sculptures.
All the reliefs and statues of the cour carrée courtyard represent specific allegories or figures.

Here is the example of the first window on the left of the 2nd floor of the wing Lemercier, so close to the pavillon de l'Horloge. Above the window, an allegory of the Law. Then, at the level of the window from left to right: <a href="Moses">Moses</a> with the tables of the law, the Egyptian goddess <a href="Isis">Isis</a> with a <a href="sister">sister</a>, the Inca emperor <a href="Manco%20C%C3%A1pac">Manco Cápac</a> with the sun whose he is the son, <a href="Numa%20Pompilius">Numa Pompilius</a> the second king of the Roman monarchy.

"<a href="Children%27s%20Literature%20%28journal%29">Children's Literature</a>" comments that the book deals with familiar themes to the Warriors series such as youth versus age, new versus tradition, and the discovery that others are not very different from oneself. "<a href="Kidsreads">Kidsreads</a>" states that the theme of racisim is honestly dealt throughout the book along with the fact that a strong message about the environment is sent.

The reviewer also mentions the theme of habitat destruction and global climate change. Readers are advised to read the series in order as the volume does not provide a summary of the first novel.

Skyshine's Bedlam is a <a href="Turn-based%20tactics">turn-based tactical</a> <a href="roguelike">roguelike</a> and <a href="Simulation%20video%20game">simulation game</a> developed by Skyshine Games and published by <a href="Versus%20Evil">Versus Evil</a>. It was released on September 16, 2015 for Windows and Mac OS X.

It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art and music, but criticized its story and high level of difficulty.

Gameplay.
The player is the overseer of a massive wheeled fortress known as the Dozer, and must cross a <a href="Apocalyptic%20and%20post-apocalyptic%20fiction">post-apocalyptic</a> wasteland safely. The player can choose a route on a minimap, which determines what types of encounters they have. The player can also upgrade the Dozer in order to make traversal of the wasteland easier.

Fights take place on an isometric grid. Squad members come in four classes, each with their own specialties. Soldiers cannot be replaced when they die, and it is almost inevitable that casualties will occur.

Plot.
The player must navigate the Dozer from Bysantine, a futuristic metropolis, to Aztec City, a distant <a href="utopia">utopia</a>. Many factions control parts of the wasteland in between, such as Cyborgs, Mutants, Marauders, or A.I. Each trip is <a href="Procedural%20generation">procedurally generated</a>, and events occur differently in each playthrough.

Development.
The setting of the game was formerly a <a href="Tabletop%20role-playing%20game">tabletop RPG</a>, and was based on 80's science fiction and <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>. The developers were also inspired by the fast pace of games like "" and "".

The game uses the engine of "<a href="The%20Banner%20Saga">The Banner Saga</a>". It was originally known as simply "Bedlam", but changed its name to avoid conflict with the game "<a href="Bedlam%20%28video%20game%29">Bedlam</a>" released shortly beforehand, despite having already filed a trademark for the name. It was developed after a successful <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> campaign which raised $166,540.

Reception.
The game received mixed reviews, with an aggregate score of 67/100 on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>.

Ian Birnbaum of <a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a> rated the game 72/100, calling it "punishing" and "stressful", and saying that the difficulty was too high for him to enjoy. He stated that the inability to recruit new squad members if your existing ones died was where the game "crossed the line from enjoyably brutal to stressful frustration". However, he praised the soundtrack, saying that it was his "favorite [...] in any game since "<a href="Bastion%20%28video%20game%29">Bastion</a>"", and called the art "wonderful".

Mat Paget of <a href="GameSpot">Gamespot</a> rated the game 60/100, saying that while he believed it would be the "perfect game" for him at first glance, it did not have "much strategic depth" or a reason to "care about [the characters]". He called the story "devoid of interesting or layered tales".

Artur Cnotalski of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer Poland</a> rated the game 40/100, saying that it was "monotonous", with the storyline "devoid of any depth".

Maredudd ap Rhys Grug (died 1271), son of <a href="Rhys%20Gryg">Rhys Gryg</a>, was a Welsh prince of <a href="Deheubarth">Deheubarth</a>. Maredudd intially ruled north east of <a href="Ystrad%20Tywi">Ystrad Tywi</a>, including <a href="Llandovery%20Castle">Llandovery castle</a>, until he expanded to rule the region encompassing <a href="Dryslwyn%20Castle">Dryslwyn castle</a>.

Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg died at Dryslwyn on 27 July 1271, leaving behind his son, <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Maredudd">Rhys ap Maredudd</a>. He is buried at Whitland Abbey.

Exile.
Maredudd was exiled from the south around 1250 due to rivalries with his brother and his nephew, <a href="Rhys%20Mechyll">Rhys Mechyll</a> and Rhys Fychan ap Rhys Mechyll. He fled to Gwynedd where he joined <a href="Llywelyn%20ap%20Gruffudd">Llywelyn ap Gruffydd</a> on his successful campaigns of 1256. Llywelyn thus rewarded him with land round <a href="Llanbadarn%20Fawr%2C%20Ceredigion">Llanbadarn</a> and <a href="Buellt">Cantref Buellt</a>. 

Treason and homage.
Maredudd contributed significantly in the 1257 <a href="Battle%20of%20Cadfan">battle of Cymerau</a> where the Welsh side were victorious. However, Rhys Fychan's siding with the Welsh during this battle disenfranchised Maredudd; though he swore allegiance to Llywelyn in 1258, he later that year sided with the <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">king</a>. Consequently, on 28 May 1259, Maredydd was put on trial for treason, the first trial of its kind in Wales. He was found guilty by a council of native lords and imprisoned in <a href="Criccieth%20Castle">Criccieth castle</a>.

In 1261, Maredudd was granted reconciliation with Llywelyn under severe terms, though the king retained Maredudd's <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">homage</a> in 1267 following the peace of Montgomery. Llywelyn received this homage in 1270.

Aleksandr Promptov

Aleksandr Nikolaevich Promptov (27 June 1898, <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a> - 11 November 1948, Koltushi ) was a Russian and Soviet <a href="geneticist">geneticist</a> and <a href="Ornithology">ornithologist</a> who studied bird calls, made recordings and suggested the role of vocalization and behavior in isolation and <a href="speciation">speciation</a>.

Promptov was born in the family of a high-ranking Russian revenue official. He went to school in <a href="Kostroma">Kostroma</a> and graduated from the Nechaev gymnasium in Moscow. Even as a young boy, he took an interest in birds but he chose to study experimental zoology rather than ornithology. It is thought that his choice may have been aided by family ties to <a href="Nikolai%20Koltsov">Nikolai Koltsov</a>. Promptov's and Koltsov's mothers were related and Koltsov influenced the authorities to let Promptov study the genetics of fowl under Aleksandr Serebrovskii, a former student of Koltsov, in a project funded by the People's Commissariat of Agriculture. Promptov graduated in 1923 and joined the University in the department of genetics. He contributed to a translation of T.H. Morgan's "Physical Basis of Heredity" into Russian and joined <a href="Sergei%20Chetverikov">Sergei Chetverikov</a>'s research team working on "Drosophila". In 1926 he started research at Moscow University's Institute of Zoology on <a href="Pleiotropy">pleiotropism</a> and polymorphism in "<a href="Drosophila">Drosophila</a>" genetics. Throughout this period, he continued to take an interest in field ornithology and began to explore many aspects of avian biology including song learning and hybridization of finches. After defending his dissertation in 1929 he made a trip to the Urals to study song variation in several bird species. Returning after two months, he took up a job of a lecturer in general biology. He gradually intensified his studies in ornithology and in 1937 he produced a 400 page manual of field ornithology, "Птицы в природе" ("birds in nature") which is still considered a classic. It included calls described in his own notations. Promptov also pioneered bird sound recording in the USSR with an instrument that made use of photographic film. In 1940 he moved to an Ornithological Laboratory at the Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Pathology of Higher Nervous Activity which had been established in Koltushi by <a href="Ivan%20Pavlov">Ivan Pavlov</a> and then directed by his student <a href="Leon%20Orbeli">Leon Orbeli</a>. He began to study species specific stereotyped behaviour in birds but the war broke out. Promptov stayed at the Institute through the war and after the war, he was visited by <a href="Julian%20Huxley">Julian Huxley</a> who reported that it was the only work on the genetics of behaviour in wild birds that he knew of. On November 11, 1948 Promptov committed suicide. Some of his work was posthumously published by his wife Elizaveta Lukina (who was also a research collaborator).

Promptov examined speciation processes and noted that song variation was through both heredity and learning.

Martha'r Mynydd

Martha'r Mynydd (English: 'Mountain Martha'), fl. c. 1770, was a woman who lived in a cottage near <a href="Llanllyfni">Llanllyfni</a>. She is known for having convinced many neighbours of the existence of ‘a folk called The Invisibles’. 'The Invisibles' were said to be a large group of wealthy people who attended markets and fairs without being seen. She claimed a 'Mr. Ingram' lived nearby in an invisible mountain mansion, with his daughter 'Miss Ingram', who was occasionally seen dressed completely in white. 'Mr. Ingram' would come to night time assemblies at Martha's cottage to preach.

'Mr. Ingram' was most likely Martha's father, while Martha played 'Miss Ingram'; a sceptic, knowing Martha to have burnt her foot, once stepped on 'Miss Ingram' 's foot at a gathering and recognised the subsequent cry to be Martha's voice. However, this sceptic was chased from the countryside by her followers. Nonetheless, this sparked doubt as to the truth of Martha's tales so that Martha abandoned the trick. She instead committed herself to the Methodist cause at Llanllyfni.

<doc id="54811649" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54811649" title="Mangaung African Cultural Festival">
Mangaung African Cultural Festival

The Mangaung African Cultural Festival (MACUFE) is an annual showcase of African arts, culture and various sports disciplines that takes place in <a href="Bloemfontein">Bloemfontein</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. It is one of the largest emerging festivals in Africa as it has grown from having an audience of 30 000 in 1997 to 140 000 in 2015. 

The festival runs for 10 days beginning on the first week of October each year in the <a href="Free%20State">Free State</a> province of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>

MACUFE consists of a main musical festival, an arts and crafts exhibition, theatre productions, a beauty pageant, the Sparta Macufe Cup which is a soccer league at the <a href="Free%20State">Free State</a> stadium and performing arts.
It also hosts an official corporate village where there are brand specific lounges, with each their own client service personnel.

History.
Even though the unfolding of an arts festival platform after 1994 in the New <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> was a key development in SA professional theatre, numerous festivals did relatively little to explore and celebrate black (South) African culture, theatre or productions . Every festival had a small number of black artists taking part in productions, and audiences included some few black theatre-goers, but the participation of the white and Western-oriented producers, as well as audiences, outweighed the contribution from black African and historically put artists and festival-goers at a disadvantage. Apart from some exceptional cases, <a href="English%20language">English</a> and <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> were used almost exclusively on the festival stages

The festival was launched in 1997 by the <a href="Free%20State">Free State</a> Provincial Government to celebrate the best local and international African artists in various disciplines. At the announcement of the festival in 1997 the general manager of SABC2, Thaninga Msimango, declared that “the concept was initiated because there was no cultural festival that expressed the rich culture of indigenous South Africans.” And the Free State MEC for sports, arts and culture, M.W. Molefe, added that “most popular and successful festivals in South Africa are focused on Eurocentric culture, paying scant regard to indigenous African culture” (Makhaya, 1997). Officially dubbed an “African cultural festival”, rather than an “arts festival”, the intention was clear: to stage an event that would recognise and celebrate indigenous African cultural heritage, and specifically as a balance to the other arts festivals which were perceived to do little in that regard.

Events at MACUFE.
· Miss Glamorous <a href="Free%20State">Free State</a> is a provincial beauty pageant that takes place during MACUFE. The pageant was established in 2014 under the Dipalesa Pitchov Foundation.

Richard Martin (Mayor of Swansea)

Sir Richard Martin (1843-1922) was an industrialist and public man. He was <a href="Swansea">Mayor of Swansea</a> 1898-9 and was influential in developping education facilities in Swansea.

Early Life and Career.
Richard Martin was born in Pentre-mawr, Swansea, August 1843. He attended Copper Works School in <a href="Hafod">Hafod</a> before beginning work in the Millbrook iron works, Swansea. He became a clerk in the civil service in 1867 and transferred from Swansea to Grimsby in 1872. However, he returned to Swansea three years later to start a business; he co-founded the Vale of Swansea zinc works in 1879 at <a href="Llansamlet">Llansamlet</a>. He remained connected to the zinc works, which still operate today, until his death. He started up the Birch Grove iron works in 1881 and bought the Ynys-pen-llwch tin works in 1884. 

Political Career and Swansea University.
Martin served the town council 1884-1910 as member and alderman, becoming mayor 1898-9. He was also chairman of the education committee for six years. In this time, he strived to have the University College of South Wales situated in Swansea, however Cardiff was ultimately chosen as its site. He nevertheless succeeded in ensuring the establishment of a technical school, which later became the technical college, in Swansea.

Martin then strove to ensure the college's recognition as one of the constituent colleges of the University of Wales, alongside Sir <a href="Isambard%20Owen">Isambard Owen</a>, to no avail. However, Martin pushed for a university college in Swansea, urging its necessity upon the Haldane Commission on Welsh university education (1916-18), with the result that it was founded in 1920, developping in later years into <a href="Swansea%20University">Swansea University</a>. King George V laid the foundation stone, and knighted Richard Martin at this time.

Martin continued to work on improving the town, building the Normal College on the Glanmor Estate in addition. However, his work was cut short by his sudden death in London on 11 September 1922. He is buried at <a href="Ystumllwynarth">Ystum Llwynarth</a>.

Marina Știrbei

Marina Știrbei (1912–2001) was a Romanian aviator who gained fame in the <a href="WWII">Second World War</a> as a founding member of the <a href="Romanian%20Air%20Force">Romanian Air Force</a>'s all-women White Squadron, rescuing the wounded from the front lines. More recently, the Romanian press have called her the "Princess of Romanian aviation".

Biography.
Born on 19 March 1912 in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, Austria, Marina Știrbei was the daughter of Prince George Știrbei, who was <a href="Barbu%20%C8%98tirbey">Barbu Știrbey</a>'s brother, and Elisabeth, niece of the pioneering aviator <a href="George%20Valentin%20Bibescu">George Valentin Bibescu</a>. After repeatedly being refused entrance to the Romanian Pilots School on the grounds she was a woman, in 1932 she was finally allowed to train there under Ioana Cantacuzino. She was granted her Grade II pilot's licence in 1935. The following year, she won the first pilots contest in Romania.

Știrbei was the first to fly from <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, encountering mist over the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. In June 1937, representing the Romanian Aeroclub, she took part in the first technical assistance conference in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>.

Inspired by the Finnish women's piloting initiative known as <a href="Lotta%20Sv%C3%A4rd">Lotta Svärd</a>, she was successful in persuading the aviation ministry to form a women's squadron to help repatriate the wounded from the front lines. Known as the White Squadron, the unit was based at <a href="Baneasa">Baneasa</a>. By 1940, the squadron consisted of 10 planes, ferrying doctors and medicines, and bringing back the wounded. The name White Squadron was given by the Italian journalist <a href="Curzio%20Malaparte">Curzio Malaparte</a>, inspired by the white planes marked only by the sign of the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>.

In 1942, Știrbei married Prince Constantin Basarab Brâncoveanu, celebrated with an extravagant aristocratic wedding reception. When the Communists took control in Romania, the prince was arrested and his property was confiscated. Știrbei raised her two children on her own but in 1964, she managed to leave the country. After settling for a time in England, she moved to France where she died on 15 July 2001 in <a href="Bouloc%2C%20Haute-Garonne">Bouloc</a>.

<doc id="54811976" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54811976" title="MRU Window Switching Order">
MRU Window Switching Order

The Most Recently Used (MRU) way of window switching order is an algorithm which is used by several <a href="Multiple%20Document%20Interface">Multiple Document Interface</a> (MDI) programs to determine which window to focus from the current one.

In an MDI environment one particular software manages several files at the same time but the user interacts mostly only with one of them. For example, <a href="Word%20processor">Word processor</a> <a href="Application_software">applications</a>, like <a href="Microsoft%20Word">Microsoft Word</a> or <a href="LibreOffice%20Writer">LibreOffice Writer</a> can keep more documents opened, a photo manipulator application like <a href="Photoshop">Photoshop</a> or <a href="GIMP">GIMP</a> can have more images opened, and so on. Each individual document, image, etc. has their own window within the parent application. 

When the user wants to switch from one window to the other one, using the keyboard, then most of the applications use the MRU technique to determine which window to jump to. 

The MRU technique means that from the current window, focusing the last visited window requires the least number of action (key presses), the next recently used one needs more actions, and so on. The window that was used the longest time ago, it needs the most key presses. 

Key combinations for changing windows.
The required action for window changing in most of the applications is pressing the <a href="Control%20key">Ctrl</a> and the <a href="Tab%20key">Tab</a> keys in a specific order. <a href="Operating%20system">Operating system</a>s, however, use the <a href="Alt%20key">Alt</a> and Tab keys for changing windows. 

The required key operations is denoted by Ctrl+Tab or Alt+Tab which mean the following steps:
The Ctrl+Tab+Tab or Alt+Tab+Tab notations mean:
and so on, Ctrl+Tab+Tab+...+Tab means pressing Tab several times while the Ctrl is kept pressed continuously.



Benefit of MRU.
The basic idea behind the MRU technique is that in most cases, if a user keeps more windows open at the same time then they don't
want to use them equally. It is much more likely that they jump only amongst the last two or three windows and if there is a fourth one opened as well which was used longer time ago then it is less likely to be needed again. Thus, the more frequent actions need less key presses while the less frequent ones need more. Subsequently, working with an application that is using the MRU algorithm is easier, faster and more efficient. 

Drawback of MRU.
The MRU algorithm maintains the list of the windows in order to know which window to focus after a certain number of key presses. The order of the windows in this list is changing after each window change and it is hard for the user to keep in mind how many key presses a certain window needs to bring it into focus. 

In order to cope with this program, some software show the content of the list of the windows when the user starts the key presses for changing window, that is, after the first Tab while Ctrl or Alt is pressed.

Alternative to MRU: order of opening time (OoOT).
Most applications that don't use MRU technique, they use the order of opening time of the files. This means that from the current document, reaching the one that was opened right after the current window needs the least number of actions. After the most recently opened document, the first one comes again.


Benefit of the OoOT algorithm.
The benefit of this technique is that moving from window #i to #j always needs the same amount of actions, as long as no windows between them gets closed.

Drawback of OoOT.
Alternating between #i and #(i+1) adjacent windows needs 1 step in one direction and N-1 in the opposite direction (where N is the number of the windows) which is more complicated than the MRU case which needs the same one action in both directions.

Nicherson–Tarbox House

The Nicherson–Tarbox House is a historic house in <a href="Monticello%2C%20Minnesota">Monticello, Minnesota</a>, United States. It was built in 1889 in a blend <a href="Queen%20Anne%20style%20architecture%20in%20the%20United%20States">Queen Anne</a> and <a href="Shingle%20style%20architecture">Shingle Style</a> architecture. A barn was moved to the rear of the lot around the turn of the 20th century to serve as a <a href="carriage%20house">carriage house</a>, now a detached garage. The property, which contained a second outbuilding that is no longer extant, was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1979 as the Nicherson-Tarbox House, Shed and Barn for having local significance in the theme of architecture. It was nominated for being a prominent and well-preserved example of Queen Anne and Shingle Style architecture in Monticello.

Description.
The Nicherson–Tarbox House is a two-story building with irregular <a href="massing">massing</a> and a prominent tower at the northeast corner. Random-<a href="course%20%28architecture%29">coursed</a> pink <a href="granite">granite</a> blocks form the lower level walls, foundation, and chimney. In places, the lower level is sheathed in narrow <a href="clapboard%20%28architecture%29">clapboard</a>. The upper level, <a href="gable">gable</a>s, and roof are clad in cedar <a href="wood%20shingle">wood shingle</a>s. The exterior retains a <a href="polychrome">polychrome</a> treatment typical of the period.

The barn is a one-and-a-half-story wooden structure. Its <a href="board%20and%20batten">board and batten</a> siding and <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> door panels suggest that its construction predates the house. At the time of the property's National Register nomination, a one-story shed stood near the back of the house. It had clapboard siding, a gable roof, and polychrome decoration similar to the main house. It no longer appears to be extant.

History.
The house was built in 1889 for Evert A. Nicherson, a local lumberman. In the late 1890s, the house was purchased by James C. Tarbox, a prominent <a href="Wright%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Wright County</a> attorney and judge. Tarbox acquired an old barn from a farm in <a href="Monticello%20Township%2C%20Wright%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Monticello Township</a> and had it moved onto the property. He used it to house his <a href="carriage">carriage</a> and the horses to pull it, with hay stored in the loft above.

Timber was being exported to Britain from Pictou harbour as early as 1777 and the first ship was built there in 1788 by Thomas Copeland. By 1803, fifty vessels loaded squared timber for Britain. The Harriet was launched in 1798 with a registered tonnage of 422 tons and is believed to be the largest built in Nova Scotia at the time. 

By 1830 coal was being brought from the inland towns by steamboat for transshipment and soon coal and iron were the chief exports through the harbour. Pictou thrived as a port, and the United States government recognized its importance and operated a <a href="consulate">consulate</a> from 1837 to 1897 to look after its interests in Pictou County coal and fish from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20St.%20Lawrence">Gulf of St. Lawrence</a>. Pictou opened as a <a href="Ship%20registration">port of registry</a> in 1840 and at that time was registering between 20 and 40 ships a year. In 1874 the Customs House was built by the <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Dominion Government</a> to collect tariffs and duties, and control goods and people flowing through the port, which was a significant <a href="port%20of%20entry">port of entry</a> at the time, and the main passenger connection with <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a>.

The first railway to reach Pictou Harbour was in 1867 when the Pictou extension of the <a href="Nova%20Scotia%20Railway">Nova Scotia Railway</a> reached Pictou Landing on the south shore of the harbour. From there the railway company operated a steam-powered ferry to take passengers across the harbour where they could connect with ships leaving for <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a> and <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>. There was also a coal pier there for loading ships. The <a href="Intercolonial%20Railway">Intercolonial Railway</a> opened a line into Pictou town in 1887. Ferry service from the upriver towns declined with the introduction of rail service and ceased in the 1920's due to the increasing use of cars, but the ferry between Pictou, Pictou Landing and Abercrombie continued until after World War 2.

On August 24, 1873 a hurricane caused extensive damage throughout the harbour. The water rose above the wharves, causing goods and lumber to be washed away. Wharves and coal piers on both sides of the harbour were extensively damaged and ships at anchor were driven ashore. The <a href="brigantine">brigantine</a> Willow Brae was driven up the Middle River and 300 tons of coal had to be unloaded before she could be salvaged. The <a href="schooner">schooner</a> Guiding Star carrying 140 tons of coal went so far up the Middle River that she had to be abandoned.

The Canadian Trade Review reported in 1900 that Pictou harbour was also handling <a href="produce">produce</a> and <a href="dairy%20products">dairy products</a> from Prince Edward Island, as well as most of the lobster from the eastern end of the Gulf. It was also importing iron ore from the mine at <a href="Belle%20Isle%20%28Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%29">Belle Isle</a>, Newfoundland, for the Nova Scotia Iron Company smelters at <a href="Eureka%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Ferrona</a>, and copper ore for the Copper Crown Company in Pictou. A pier at <a href="Granton%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Granton</a> on the Middle River, 3 miles upstream from the harbour, was loading steamships of 3,000 ton capacity with coal from the Drummond colliery in <a href="Westville%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Westville</a>.

On September 25, 1925 the cargo steamer Dieuze caught fire and sank outside the shipping lane. The captain was the only person aboard at the time and he survived. The wreck was rediscovered in 2015 during surveying work by the <a href="Canadian%20Hydrographic%20Service">Canadian Hydrographic Service</a> sitting upright on the bottom in 13.5 metre deep water, but it wasn't until divers explored the wreck that it could be identified.

<a href="Pictou%20Shipyard">Pictou Shipyard</a> was established during World War 2, causing the population of the town to triple, and is notable for its construction of 24 <a href="Park%20ship">Park ship</a>s over a two year period during <a href="World%20War%202">World War 2</a>, and continues in business today.

Current usage of the harbour.
In Pictou town, the Pictou Marine Terminals offer three berths for ships up to 150m, and a 17 berth marina for small pleasure craft and a Canadian Coast Guard Inshore Search and Rescue Service boat. The Hector Heritage Quay Visitor's Marina has moorings for 40 pleasure craft. On the outskirts of town is the private Pictou Marina, home of the Pictou Yacht Club. Directly across the harbour from there is a fishing wharf at Pictou Landing. <a href="Cruise%20ship">Cruise ship</a>s began visiting Pictou in 2014.

Environment.
Human settlement and industrial activity have impacted Pictou harbour since the 18th century through pollution, impacts on wilderness habitat and harvesting of renewable resources.

He has magister degree in "International Economics", and "Investment Management" and an <a href="MBA%20degree">MBA degree</a>. <a href="PhD">PhD</a> in Economics. He worked at senior positions in state bodies, banking, commercial structures and defense industry.



Biography.
Career.
Financial sector.
Among the accomplishments of Maxim Glushchenko also was the attraction of capital on the international financial markets: preparation of <a href="Eurobonds">Eurobonds</a>, syndicated loan preparation, organization of the process of securitization of the bank's mortgage portfolio, post-import financing of customer agreements.



Defense sector.
Konotop Aircraft Repair Plant "AVIAKON".
After appointing, Glushchenko expanded the sales markets and strengthened the financial position of the company. At his initiative, a number of promising export contracts were concluded. In particular, co-operation was established with the French company <a href="Sagem%20D%C3%A9fense%20S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9">Sagem D.S.</a> and the state program "Helicopter" was reanimated, which provided equipment and modernization of the <a href="MI-24">MI-24</a> helicopters with modern French equipment. 

State-owned enterprise "AVIAKON" under the lead of Glushchenko: in 2012, revenue from sales of products on the domestic market increased by 38%, the cost of sold products decreased by 43% and receivables by 50%. Profitability increased by more than a third. Also, for half a year of his work, the number of contracts signed on the foreign market for repair of aviation equipment was doubled and of financial assets of the enterprise increased for 40%.


State Concern "Ukroboronprom".
Maxim Glushchenko contributed to the establishment and expansion of cooperation with such countries as <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Congo">Congo</a>, <a href="SAR">SAR</a> and others.

In 2012, the largest contract with Algeria for the repair and modernization of 24 helicopters МІ-24 was concluded in the history of the concern for a total sum of $150 million.

In 2013, in three times (from $120 million to $400 million) the exports of military goods to India were increased. This is due to the successful execution of a contract for the export of missiles Р-27 produced by State join stock holding company "Artem". Also, cooperation in the field of exporting <a href="Gas%20turbine%20engine">gas turbine engines</a> for ships was successfully developed.

A contract with the Indian corporation "<a href="Larsen%20%26amp%3B%20Toubro%20Ltd">Larsen&Toubro ltd</a>" was signed with his participation for the joint development and supply of 138 units of <a href="Anti-aircraft%20missile%20systems">AAMS</a>. As well as a contract for the repair and modernization of AN-32 aircraft for the <a href="Indian%20Air%20Force">Indian Air Force</a> was signed.

In early 2014, Ukraine won a tender for the <a href="Army%20of%20India">Army of India</a> modernization.
In 2014, thanks to a concerted effort, a contract with China was reanimated for the delivery of the "Bison" ships on the airbags for a total sum of $350 million and a second ship was delivered.

At the initiative of Glushchenko, a new approach was adopted for the coordination of domestic enterprises-special exporters in foreign markets. This greatly increased the activation and effectiveness of marketing activities, which is confirmed by the growth of foreign trade prices and the expansion of markets.

Glushchenko during his work paid attention not only to the international connections of the concern. According to his opinion, without the development of the domestic market it is impossible to develop fully the external one. Thus, the state concern managed to expand significantly the nomenclature of the production of weapons and <a href="Military%20equipment%20of%20Ukraine">military equipment</a> - from 12 samples in 2012 to 18 samples in 2013. At the same time, the number of new samples introduced in mass production has increased fourfold. Namely, the mass production of tanks <a href="BM%20Oplot">BM "Oplot"</a> and tanks engines 6 TD-2E, 152-mm controlled <a href="Artillery%20shell">artillery shells</a> "Flower" (state enterprise "Progress"), 90-mm and 105 mm guided missiles "Falarick" and light antitank missile systems "Corsair" (state enterprise "Kyiv State Design Bureau "Luch").

It was impossible to bring order to the state-owned concern Ukroboronprom without eliminating the corruption schemes of arms trade. For the cessation of the shadow flows of the heads of a number of structures of the defense industry complex, Maxim Glushchenko was dismissed, but after changing the leadership of the Concern and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Ukraine%29">Ministry of Defense</a>, he was again invited on the position of the Deputy Director to Ukroboronprom.

Expert and public activities.
Glushchenko also offered a transparent mechanism for the sale of military products and the elimination of abuses with the sale of excessive assets of the Ministry of Defense, when under the guise of obsolete technics, at the insignificant in ten times price combat-capable samples were sold. An agreement was signed, but its execution was blocked in 2013 by the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry returned to arms sales through intermediaries.

In the summer of 2014, Maxim Glushchenko joined the <a href="Volunteer%20movement">volunteer movement</a>, one of the first began to supply to the military personnel of <a href="Ukrainian%20Armed%20Forces">Ukrainian Army</a> the professional means of defense and the completion of weapons.

Vehicle Recognition Identification

Vehicle Recognition Identification (VRI) is a technology that employs cameras and surveillance systems to identify vehicles and analyze information. Using an array of input types including image and video, VRI systems can identify data such as vehicle make, model and driver . VRI software has applications in targeted advertising, law enforcement, military, car buying and selling, and toll road invoicing. 

VRI is also closely related to other technologies such as License Plate Recognition (LPR) and <a href="Automatic%20number%20plate%20recognition">Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR).</a> However, Vehicle Recognition is a wider umbrella term: VRI analyzes an entire vehicle instead of seeking out the numbers on a license plate.

Panangad, Kochi

Panangad is a small island located 6 km from vytilla junction that is accessible through the national highway 66 by taking a left from madavana junction while coming from vytilla.<br>

Panangad is one of the islands that make up the urban agglomeration of Kochi, Kerala, India. Only 6 Km from Vytilla Jn.It was merged into the city limits during expansion of kochi city limits which ends at a small village near panangad called as kumbalam.

Hospital<br>

Also primary government health clinic is located nearby post office about 300 meters away from main road.there are few private hospitals and clinics in and around the village itself.Also one of the well known Tertiary hospital "V.P.S Lakeshore Hospital" is located about 1.5 km away from periphery,hence health is never a problem around here. <br>

Law and Order<br>

Panangad Police Station is located at the periphery of panangad village and officers are always for help at anytime and night time patrols are also seen during festival times.<br>

Education<br>

Also panangad have a high school named Panangad V.H.S.S(Vocational higher secondary school) and other smaller private schools nearby among which the prominent ones being HIRA public school,Sri Sri RaviShankar school etc.There are two public libraries at panangad,one at kamoth a small junction in panangad and other one at the end of the panangad road which also houses the private bus stand and an abandoned boat jetty. The Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies, an autonomous publicly funded institution established on 20th November 2010 and the first Fisheries University in India coming under the Fisheries Ministry is headquartered at Panangad along the NH-47.It is the primary instrument of Kerala state in providing human resources, skills and technology required for the sustainable development of fisheries and the ocean. It acts as a centre of excellence for human resource development in Fisheries and Ocean Studies and the nodal agency to establish relationship with institutions and universities functioning at national and international level.<br>

Real Estate <br>

Since the boom in development in central city region many of the realtors have moved to suburbs like panangad to build new apartments villas and complexes that are being sold at prices from 50 lakhs to 4.7 crores ,some of the main builders include prime meridian ,anna properties ,etc.
Also God of the cricket Sachin Tendulkar have a house at Panangad offered by Prime meridian which he has visited only once.

Private buses are available at every 5-10 minutes in here.but public buses like kurtc are very low in number the reason mainly being that roads are not big enough to accommodate large buses used by kurtc usually called as "aana bus".Though low floor buses were once introduced through this route, they didn't endure for long since the road didn't have enough width to handle two buses at same time in any location.
<br>

At the end of panangad road where buses are sheltered,the location is open to riverside which is a cool place to hangout at dawn or dusk to relax from the busy city life ahead on the day or after a bogus day at work. <br>

Nearby village-Cheppanam<br>

Cheppanam is a small village that is connected to panangad which were earlier mostly fields used in agriculture which now houses realty constructions including flats,boat clubs etc.<br>

Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche

Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche (, also shortened as "RAM") is a <a href="Guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla</a> group that operates in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>. It is a <a href="separatist">separatist</a> organization in the <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>, and seeks to secede territories of both countries to create a <a href="Mapuche">Mapuche</a> nation. It has been designated a terrorist group by Argentina and Chile.

Ideology.
Facundo Jones Huala is the leader of the RAM. He is currently held prisoner in <a href="Esquel">Esquel</a>, <a href="Chubut%20Province">Chubut Province</a>. He was interviewed by the TV program "<a href="Periodismo%20para%20todos">Periodismo para todos</a>", and said: "There are things that I can not conceal, like my political and ideological doctrine. We support the use of political violence as a weapon of self-defense. We plan the mapuche liberation as the reconstruction of our world. We are the armed wing of the Mapuche movement: we use molotovs, knifes, sticks. More than that, we can't afford".

Attacks.
One of the first attacks was committed at the <a href="National%20Route%2040%20%28Argentina%29">National Route 40</a>, burning a truck. The driver, Luis Rastrelini, commented that he was surprised by an improvised rock roadblock, and then was attacked by hooded men. They filled the truck with oil, and then made it explode with a <a href="molotov%20cocktail">molotov cocktail</a>.

Another attack took place in <a href="Bariloche">Bariloche</a>. They burned two buildings, and left banners asking for the freedom of their leader, Facundo Jones Huala. Those banners featured their logo, composed by a mapuche shield and a rifle.

They also attacked the <a href="estancia">estancia</a>s of the <a href="Benetton%20family">Benetton family</a> at the <a href="Chubut%20Province">Chubut Province</a>. The watchman Evaristo Jones reported that they attacked and tortured him, stole his weapons and burned his shed, claiming that it was not an action against him but against the owners of the estancia. The guerrilla committed similar attacks against other employees and their families, burned forests and farming grounds, vandalized the farming vehicles and the electric service, and the vehicles in the nearby roads.

The policeman José Aigo was killed when he tried to check a truck heading to <a href="Alumin%C3%A9">Aluminé</a>. The Chilean organizations "Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez" and the "Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres" took credit for it. Both organizations are part of the RAM.

The RAM blocked a road near El Maitén, and were dispersed by the <a href="Argentine%20National%20Gendarmerie">Argentine National Gendarmerie</a>. Santiago Maldonado, a member of this organization, was reported missing after that. The group made then their first attack in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, vandalizing the "Casa de Chubut" building.

Reactions.
Facundo Jones Huala, the leader of the organization, is currently held prisoner in Argentina, and trialed for terrorism charges. Chile asked for his extradition, to judge him for similar charges, but Argentina has refused to do so. The Argentine police has tried to drive them away from the estancias of the Benetton family, but were unsuccessful so far.

The mapuche "lonkos" Camilo Nahuelquir and Raducindo Calfupan rejected the actions of the RAM, and pointed that their actions are not endorsed by the Mapuche populations.

Kompogas

Kompogas is a worldwide registered trademark and a patent-protected process for the anaerobic digestion of organic waste. The principle of this continuous and fully automated process is based on the closed loop recycling management. 

The pioneer Walter Schmid invented and realized the company Kompogas. In 1989, after experiments on his own balcony, Walter Schmid realized the first anaerobic digester with 20 cubic meter volume. In 1991 the first full-sized plant was built with initial funding by the canton of Zurich. At this time, it was quite hard to get the needed green waste for his project. He had to lobby with all kind of politicians to get enough organic waste. Also the business journal Handelszeitung wrote that probably rising energy prices will help in the future. 

The first plant in Rümlang produced approximately 2,8 Mio. kWh per year. Since 1995 trucks of the Walter Schmid AG and of the company Kompogas drove with biogas.
In Switzerland the produced compost or digestate is often available for free for private purpose. These products are also certified for organic cultivation. 

Since 2006 Axpo had a minority shareholding of the company Kompogas before 2011 Axpo took over the entire company. In October 2014 the Japanese-Swiss cleantech company Hitachi Zosen Inova AG took over the part of plant engineering and construction. Axpo is still operating 15 Kompogas plants in Switzerland. There are over 80 Kompogas plants in operation worldwide. 

The Kompogas process was developed steadily. In the meantime several digester sizes are available.

Fischbrunnen

The Fischbrunnen is a <a href="Water%20well">fountain</a> in the center of <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, whose history can be traced back to the Middle Ages. In 1954, <a href="Josef%20Henselmann">Josef Henselmann</a> created the fountain in its present form, using parts of <a href="Konrad%20Knoll">Konrad Knoll</a>’s <a href="New%20Gothic">neo-gothic</a> fountain that was destroyed during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>.

Location.
The Fischbrunnen is located in front of the main entrance of the <a href="New%20Town%20Hall%20%28Munich%29">New Town Hall</a> on the <a href="Marienplatz">Marienplatz</a> in the old town of Munich.

Story.
On the Schrannenplatz, today's Marienplatz, a fountain was established in the year 1318, whose exact location can no longer be determined. In 1343 a "citizen's fountain" is mentioned, which was later also called "Marktbrunnen". It was located in the northeastern area of the square, which is now the location of today's Fischbrunnen. At this location, it was a dug-out or draining fountain, which reached the groundwater, which is relatively shallow under the center of Munich.

After completion of the first water pipeline transporting water from sources outside the city to the city center of Munich, the fountain on the Marienplatz was the first and for a long time the only fountain connected to the new water pipe. The fountain supplied constantly flowing water from four brass tubes.

The predecessor of today's Fischbrunnen was designed by Konrad Knoll in 1862 to 1865 and put into operation on 19 September 1866. The bronze sculptures of the neo-gothic fountain were poured in the <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Miller">Ferdinand von Miller</a>s <a href="K%C3%B6nigliche%20Erzgie%C3%9Ferei%20in%20M%C3%BCnchen">royal ore-foundry</a>. In the fish-fountain itself were four <a href="butcher">butcher</a> builders, who poured buckets of water into the fountain. Above them stood four musical children. At the top stood a senior <a href="journeyman">journeyman</a> with a raised cup.

Since 29 July, 1884, water from the Mangfall Valley flows out of the fountain. This is also the reason for the engraved 1884 in the basin.

After the almost complete destruction in the war in 1944, Joseph Henselmann recreated the fountain in 1954, using three remaining butcher figures. Three musicians of the Knoll Fountain were also preserved and are now to be found at the <a href="Karlstor">Karlstor</a>.

The fountain now consists of a <a href="Conglomerate%20%28geology%29">Nagelfluh</a> basin, whose central column is crowned by a bronze fish from Henselmann's pupil Otto Kallenbach. This fish is reminiscent of the time when the Marienplatz still served as a central market place and the fishmonger hung their still living goods in baskets in the fresh fountain water. The three butchers let their buckets pour water into the basin, therefore the figure group plays on the "Metzgerprung" (see below).

In the course of a fundamental restoration in 1991, the fountain was equipped with a ground-water drinking point for the Munich dogs. During the last renovation in autumn 2011, the joints of the basin were re-sealed and the bronze figures were decalcified and preserved.

Traditions at the fountain.
Butchering.
At the fountain, the butcher's apprentices were "freed" on <a href="Rosenmontag">Rosenmontag</a>, until the Second World War. Today this corresponds to the handing over of the journeyman letter as conclusion of the butcher training. Up to the 19th century, the "Metzgersprung" was carried out, in which the apprentices threw themselves into the water of the fountain, free-spirited, and were also submerged. When they came back up, apples, nuts and coins were thrown among the spectators which were also splashed with water. The Metzgersprung might have been a kind of baptism, since the apprentices were then free from their sins of youth (the youthful sins).

In 1793, <a href="Charles%20Theodore%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Elector Karl Theodor</a> banned the custom, which King <a href="Maximilian%20II%20of%20Bavaria">Maximilian II</a> revived more than half a century later. In the twentieth century the tradition was carried out sporadically. The Stadtchronik recorded a re-enactment of the historical butcher's jumping after a 32-year break. There were unexpectedly large numbers of people in panic-like scenes, in which several people had broken ribs and 174 required medical attention. The next Metzgersprung was in 1954 at the unveiling of the Henselmann Fischbrunnen. The planned jump for the 800th city anniversary in 1958, on the other hand, was canceled because of a disagreement in the wake of a food scandal.

Since 1995, the jump has taken place regularly, albeit at a three-year pace, most recently on September 8, 2013.

Wallet washing.
On <a href="Ash%20Wednesday">Ash Wednesday</a>, the mayor of Munich, usually together with the city chamberlain, washed an empty wallet in the water of the Fischbrunnen. This is to ensure that the city funds will be filled again next year.

The wallet washing, whose origins date back to the 15th century, was a custom of the poorer classes. Especially in the nineteenth century, messengers and assistants explained that a salary improvement was necessary when faced with the possibilities of an empty wallet. In the 1950s, Lord Mayor <a href="Thomas%20Wimmer%20%28politician%29">Thomas Wimmer</a> passed the tradition on to the city's wallet.

Meeting point.
The Fischbrunnen is one of the most popular meeting places in Munich, especially for people from the surrounding Munich region.
