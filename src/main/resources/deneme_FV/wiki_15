<doc id="54924085" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54924085" title="Checkpoint inhibitor therapy">
Checkpoint inhibitor therapy

<a href="Immune%20checkpoint">Immune checkpoints</a> affect immune system functioning. Immune checkpoints can be stimulatory or inhibitory. Tumors can use these checkpoints to protect themselves from immune system attacks. Checkpoint therapy can block inhibitory checkpoints, restoring immune system function. One ligand-receptor interaction under investigation is the interaction between the transmembrane <a href="programmed%20cell%20death%201">programmed cell death 1</a> protein (PDCD1, PD-1; also known as CD279) and its ligand, <a href="Programmed%20cell%20death%201%20ligand%201">PD-1 ligand 1</a> (PD-L1, CD274). PD-L1 on the cell surface binds to PD1 on an immune cell surface, which inhibits immune cell activity. Among PD-L1 functions is a key regulatory role on T cell activities. It appears that (cancer-mediated) upregulation of PD-L1 on the cell surface may inhibit T cells that might otherwise attack. Antibodies that bind to either PD-1 or PD-L1 and therefore block the interaction may allow the T-cells to attack the tumor.

Types.
CTLA-4 blockade.
The first checkpoint antibody approved by the FDA was ipilimumab, approved in 2011 for treatment of melanoma. It blocks the immune checkpoint molecule <a href="CTLA-4">CTLA-4</a>. Clinical trials have also shown some benefits of anti-CTLA-4 therapy on lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, specifically in combination with other drugs. In on-going trials the combination of CTLA-4 blockade with PD-1 or <a href="PD-L1%20inhibitor">PD-L1 inhibitors</a> is tested on different types of cancer.

However, patients treated with check-point blockade (specifically CTLA-4 blocking antibodies), or a combination of check-point blocking antibodies, are at high risk of suffering from immune-related adverse events such as dermatologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or hepatic <a href="Autoimmunity">autoimmune</a> reactions. These are most likely due to the breadth of the induced T-cell activation when anti-CTLA-4 antibodies are administered by injection in the blood stream.

Using a mouse model of bladder cancer, researchers have found that a local injection of a low dose anti-CTLA-4 in the tumour area had the same tumour inhibiting capacity as when the antibody was delivered in the blood. At the same time the levels of circulating antibodies were lower, suggesting that local administration of the anti-CTLA-4 therapy might result in fewer adverse events.

PD-1 inhibitors.
Initial clinical trial results with IgG4 PD1 antibody <a href="Nivolumab">Nivolumab</a> were published in 2010. It was approved in 2014. Nivolumab is approved to treat melanoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, and <a href="Hodgkin%27s%20lymphoma">Hodgkin's lymphoma</a>. A 2016 clinical trial for non-small cell lung cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint for treatment in the first line setting, but is FDA approved in subsequent lines of therapy .

<a href="Pembrolizumab">Pembrolizumab</a> is another PD1 inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in 2014. Keytruda (<a href="Pembrolizumab">Pembrolizumab</a>) is approved to treat melanoma and lung cancer. Antibody <a href="BGB-A317">BGB-A317</a> is a PD-1 inhibitor (designed to not bind Fc gamma receptor I) in early clinical trials.

PD-L1 inhibitors.
In May 2016, PD-L1 inhibitor <a href="atezolizumab">atezolizumab</a> was approved for treating bladder cancer.

Anti-PD-L1 antibodies currently in development include <a href="avelumab">avelumab</a> and <a href="durvalumab">durvalumab</a>, in addition to an <a href="affimer">affimer</a> biotherapeutic.

Other.
Other modes of enhancing [adoptive] immuno-therapy include targeting so-called <a href="Intrinsic%20checkpoint%20blockade">intrinsic checkpoint blockades</a> e.g. <a href="CISH">CISH</a>.

<doc id="54924152" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54924152" title="Dumbell's Bank">
Dumbell's Bank

Dumbell's Bank was a bank on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>. The bank's <a href="insolvency">insolvency</a> in <a href="1900">1900</a>, known as Black Saturday and referred to on the Isle of Man as the Dumbell's Bank Crash, resulted in a <a href="run%20on%20the%20bank">run on the bank</a> with many individuals losing their life savings and the ruin of numerous local businesses causing poverty, depression and <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>. The effects were profound and lasted for a considerable number of years.

History.
Origins.
In comparison with established institutions in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> banking on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> was recent in origin. At the beginning of the <a href="19th%20Century">19th Century</a> the entirety of the Isle of Man's banking business was confined to the firms of Litter, Dove & Co., and Beatson & Copeland; later in the first decade Messers Quayle, Taubman & Kelly formed a banking operation in <a href="Castletown%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Castletown</a>, however these concerns did not last very long.

By <a href="1817">1817</a> there were five banks on the Island authorised to transact banking business and issue notes. In <a href="1843">1843</a> a concern known as Forbes' Bank collapsed which in turn resulted in great hardship for many on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>. In 1854 the Isle of Man Commercial Bank became the Bank of Mona, a branch of the <a href="City%20of%20Glasgow%20Bank">City of Glasgow Bank</a>, but in this instance also there was a failure of the parent institution and they stopped operations in <a href="1878">1878</a>. The insecurity of banking operations on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> was also illustrated by the collapse of Holmes' Bank in <a href="1854">1854</a> with total liabilites of £300,000.

Establishment.
Douglas and Isle of Man Bank.
In 1853 <a href="George%20Dumbell">George Dumbell</a>, a local <a href="advocate">advocate</a> and <a href="Tynwald">Member of the House of Keys</a>, established a private bank; the Douglas and Isle of Man Bank a trading name of Dumbell, Son & Howard, with its branch situated in St. George's Street, <a href="Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Douglas</a>. Following this branches were opened in <a href="Ramsey%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Ramsey</a> and <a href="Castletown%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Castletown</a>. However in August <a href="1857">1857</a>, only four years after the commencement of business a notice was posted by Dumbell's advising:
In addition the Bank of Mona also suspended business for a time. In time both banks reopened and in October <a href="1861">1861</a> <a href="George%20Dumbell">George Dumbell</a>, together with his partner Louis Howard, took over new premises on Prospect Hill, <a href="Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Douglas</a>.

In <a href="1862">1862</a> Dumbell's Bank secured the account of the <a href="Great%20Laxey%20Mine">Great Laxey Mining Company</a>. At that time <a href="George%20Dumbell">George Dumbell</a> was Chairman of the Great Laxey Mining Company, and by securing the account it gave an outlet for the circulation of the bank's notes - every miner whose weekly wage exceeded 20 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s would be paid with a Dumbell's Bank note. In September <a href="1864">1864</a> William Dumbell, eldest son of George Dumbell, became a third partner of the bank. 

With the passing of the Companies' Act on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> in <a href="1864">1864</a>, the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Bank">Isle of Man Banking Company Limited</a> opened with premises in Athol St, Douglas, and became the main rival to Dumbell's Bank.

Dumbell's Banking Company Limited.
A new <a href="prospectus">prospectus</a> was issued for Dumbell's Bank in <a href="1874">1874</a> and the capital was much over subscribed. Dumbell's Banking Company Limited was created, with a subscribed capital £180,000, in 30,000 shares of £6 each, of which £2 per share to be paid, namely, £1 on application and £1 on allotment, making a paid-up capital of £60,000. The directors of the new company comprised: Ridgway Harrison, Esq.; Woodside, Receiver-General of the Isle of Man; George W. Dumbell, Esq., M.H.K., Belmont, Managing Director; William. Baring Stevenson, Esq., J.P., Balladoole; Richard Penketh, Esq. M.H.K., Hampton Court; James Spittall, Esq., Ballaughton House.

Several big accounts were at that time held by Dumbell's and included: the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Mining%20Company">Isle of Man Mining Company</a>, the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Government">Isle of Man Government</a>, Douglas Town Board, the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Railway">Isle of Man Railway Company</a> and the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Steam%20Packet%20Company">Isle of Man Steam Packet Company</a>.

Following the Great Manx Bank Robbery of <a href="1878">1878</a> when the Bank of Mona was robbed of almost £9,000 there was a run on other local banks. The <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Bank">Isle of Man Bank</a> chartered a special steamer to convey £20,000 to the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, but Dumbell's got by without any special provision.<a href="Alured%20Dumbell">Alured Dumbell</a>, a son of <a href="George%20Dumbell">George Dumbell</a>, was appointed <a href="Deemster">Second Deemster</a> in <a href="1880">1880</a> and as a consequence was obliged to resign his directorship with the bank.
In <a href="1882">1882</a> a new bank opened on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> named the Manx Bank Ltd which continued until <a href="1900">1900</a> when it was absorbed by a bank based in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. 

In <a href="1883">1883</a> a local advocate, Charles Nelson, joined the bank's directors. Nelson came from an old <a href="Manx%20people">Manx</a> family, he was Chairman of the <a href="Manx%20Northern%20Railway">Manx Northern Railway</a> and his father and grandfather had both been <a href="Rector">Rector</a>s of <a href="Bride%20%28parish%29">Kirk Bride</a>.

By the latter part of the 1880s certain signs of the direction in which Dumbell's Bank was moving towards were starting to become apparent; one of which was the loss of £15,000 which the bank invested into the Peel Chemical Company. 
Following the death of <a href="George%20Dumbell">George Dumbell</a> in <a href="1887">1887</a> the bank continued in its liberal approach to its business. This was a period of economic boom on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> with the bank lending money to builders and speculators on a grand scale - two years later Dumbell's Bank paid a <a href="dividend">dividend</a> of 15%.

One incident at the time which indicated there was a degree of mistrust in Dumbell's Bank centered around a transaction involving Douglas Town Commissioners. The Town Commissioners had bought a water supply from a local businessman, Henry Noble, the consideration being £147,247; however Noble refused to accept a cheque drawn on the bank and insisted on payment in cash. There may however be another dimension to this as Henry Noble was a founder of the rival <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Bank">Isle of Man Bank</a>.
However suspicions of Dumbell's Bank existed in other financial circles. Dumbell's Bank had been instrumental in financing the <a href="Manx%20Electric%20Railway">Douglas & Laxey Electric Tramway Company Ltd</a> and it became a constant drain on the bank.

Black Saturday.
The climax to the business of Dumbell's Bank came on <a href="February%201900%23February%202%2C%201900%20%28Friday%29">Friday February 2, 1900</a> when there was a <a href="run%20on%20the%20bank">run on the bank</a>, forcing it to close its doors at its head office on Prospect Hill. Many working people had not received their weekly wages and the following day, referred to as Black Saturday, continued to see the bank besieged. Trade underwent a period of stagnation and shares were unmarketable for many months. Shares in the <a href="Manx%20Electric%20Railway">Tramway Company</a> fell from 27 <a href="shillings">shillings</a> to 1 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>, shares in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Steam%20Packet%20Company">Isle of Man Steam Packet Company</a> fell from 19 shillings to 12 shillings and Amalgamated Breweries share price fell from 20 <a href="shillings">shillings</a> to 11 <a href="shillings">shillings</a>. So acute was the crisis that certain merchants from <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> closed the accounts which they held on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>.

Another consequence of the bank's failure was the fact that those in business who had incurred liabilities with Dumbell's were unable to arrange with other financial institutions to take over their liability to Dumbell's, and this led to a series of failures with a further knock-on effect and the closing of the bank resulted in a long list of <a href="bankruptcies">bankruptcies</a>. 
There were similar scenes outside the branch offices. In <a href="Ramsey%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Ramsey</a> a further <a href="bank%20run">bank run</a> resulted in a big rush of people coming in from the surrounding countryside. 
Over 200 shareholders attended an extraordinary general meeting of Dumbell's on February 12. One director sharply criticised the general manager and manager, with other shareholders in turn criticising the directors, accusing them of profligacy and a reckless lending policy which had contributed immensely to the bank's demise. 
Accusations and counter-accusations were in turn levelled at the bank's directors. Alexander Bruce, the principal manager, wrote from his sick bed to deny a statement from the Chairman that the balance sheet had been drawn up irregularly. Another manager, John Shimmon, wrote to refute an allegation that there was an undisclosed liability to the Tramway Company in the sum of £65,000 "(this liability would later be proven during the liquidation)". In April 1900 there was a creditor's petition to the <a href="Chancery%20Court">Chancery Court</a> for the winding up of the company.Dumbell's premises and goodwill were acquired by Parr's Bank for £40,300.

Liquidation.
The liquidators of Dumbell's Bank found the bank's affairs in such a complicated state that it took several months to unravel the accounts, to find out its true position and to crystallise it so in order for exact charges to be formulated.

On June 13, 1900, four months after the collapse the preliminary inquiry began before <a href="High%20Bailiff">High Bailiff</a> <a href="Samuel%20Harris%20%28bailiff%29">Samuel Harris</a> who had himself on a former occasion been a trustee of the founder of the bank when it had closed for a time in <a href="1857">1857</a> and had also wound up Holmes' Bank.
The accused were: Charles Nelson (advocate and director); John Shimmon (secretary and manager) and three accountants - John Rogers, William Aldred and William Vincent Aldred. The charges against Alexander Bruce were withdrawn due to the state of his health (he subsequently died before the end of the trial).

The preliminary proceedings before the <a href="High%20Bailiff">High Bailiff</a> were followed by a Court of Criminal Inquiry, again before <a href="High%20Bailiff">High Bailiff</a> <a href="Samuel%20Harris%20%28bailiff%29">Samuel Harris</a>, at which a <a href="jury">jury</a> of six decided there was sufficient evidence for the defendants to stand trial.

Trial.
First Indictment.
The Court of General Gaol trial of the accused commenced on November 5, <a href="1900">1900</a>, with the <a href="Tynwald%20Court">Tynwald Court</a> specially fitted out for the trial. Presiding at the trial was the <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20the%20Isle%20of%20Man">Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man</a>, <a href="Lord%20Henniker">Lord Henniker</a> (President), Harry Shee <a href="Queen%27s%20Council">QC</a>, <a href="Recorder%20%28judge%29">Recorder of Burnely</a>, who was specially commissioned and sworn in as a <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Manx</a> <a href="Deemster">Deemster</a> and Deemster Stevenson Moore.
In the first part of the trial, which lasted for nine days, Shimmon broke down under <a href="cross%20examination">cross examination</a> and wept bitterly. It was revealed that Dumbell's Bank had in the region of 8,000 investors and 750 shareholders, all chiefly on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>. The charge against the defendants was one of: ""unlawfully making, circulating and publishing three balance sheets which they knew to be false in certain material particulars, and which were intended to deceive the shareholders and creditors.""
The liquidator in his evidence stated that he had extracted from the bank accounts £470,000 in <a href="bad%20debts">bad debts</a> to June 1898 of which approximately £200,000 was irrecoverable. Another point of criticism was the sum of £65,000 owing to the <a href="Midland%20Bank">London City and Midland Bank</a> which actually appeared as a credit to Dumbell's. The sum was connected with the <a href="Manx%20Electric%20Railway">Tramway Company</a>.
Nelson was said to of handled in the region of £871,000 in the 20 years of his association with the bank and in one five year period he dealt with £270,000. His own <a href="balance%20sheet">balance sheet</a> showed a profit of £20,000 for <a href="1893">1893</a> but this was down to £827 by <a href="1898">1898</a>. Nelson's defence was that he'd been: ""drawn into a whirlpool of speculation by Alexander Bruce, and knew little of the inner workings and he had no intention whatsoever to deceive.""
After 2 hours of deliberation the <a href="jury">jury</a> returned a verdict of guilty against Nelson, however his sentence was postponed until further charges against him and Shimmon had been heard.

Second Indictment.
The second <a href="indictment">indictment</a> was that Nelson and Shimmon had fraudulently appropriated to their own use money belonging to the bank. On the 12th day of the trial (the 3rd day of the second part of the proceedings) the <a href="jury">jury</a> returned a verdict of guilty against all the defendants.

Sentence.
Nelson and Shimmon each received 5 years <a href="penal%20servitude">penal servitude</a> for fraudulently appropriating money belonging to the bank. On the charge of issuing false balance sheets Nelson and Shimmon received 3 years to run concurrently. For his part, Rogers received 18 months imprisonment with hard labour whilst William Aldred received 12 months with hard labour and William Vincent Aldred 6 months with hard labour. In January <a href="1901">1901</a> William Aldred was released on the grounds of poor health - he was 77 years old.

Mahmoud stated in a talk at Cambridge University in 2016 that he hoped to see an independent Kurdistan “working closely” with a stabilised Iraqi state.

Mahmoud has said that issues between the Iraqi Kurdish parties are affected by the oil companies which each of them set up. “The Kurdistan Democratic Party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the Change Movement, the Kurdistan Islamic Union and the Kurdistan Islamic Group established five oil companies. They are also shareholders of oil. But their issues are about the amount which this [one] has less than the other.”

He named the company the Grey Agency because the walls of the office were grey. The company's original focus was to publish direct mailings for the furrier industry which morphed into a magazine named "Furs and Fashions". In 1925, the firm, renamed the Grey Advertising Agency, became a full-fledged advertising agency and differentiated itself from its competitors by using a team approach to advertising that closely worked with its customers and conducted extensive marketing research. Valenstein focused on developing a brand through pre-selling and building a market for it. In the 1930s the firm focused on soft goods. In the 1940s, the firm was billing $1 million dollars per year.

Borden (UK) Ltd v Scottish Timber Products Ltd

Borden (UK) Ltd v Scottish Timber Products Ltd [1981] Ch 25 is a judicial decision of the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal of England and Wales</a> relating to <a href="Title%20retention%20clause">retention of title clauses</a>, and the extent to which the vendor of raw material can seek to assert title to good into which those raw materials are subsequently worked. The court held that when the relevant raw material was worked into another product it ceased to exist as a separate type of property, and accordingly it was no longer possible for a seller to retain title to it.

Facts.
Borden (UK) Ltd were manufacturers of chipboard <a href="resin">resin</a>. They were the main suppliers of that product to the company, Scottish Timber Products Ltd, who used it to manufacture <a href="Particle%20board">chipboard</a>. The resin was sold on credit terms. Those terms included a <a href="title%20retention%20clause">retention of title clause</a>. The company could store approximately two days' worth of resin on their premises. As part of the manufacturing process, the resin was mixed with hardeners and wax emulsion. This process created what was referred to as "glue mix" and was irreversible. 

On 16 September 1977 the company went into <a href="receivership">receivership</a>, and then subsequently into <a href="liquidation">insolvent liquidation</a>. Borden sought declarations from the court that they could trace their title to the resin under the retention of title clauses into the glue mix and the worked products.

Decision.
The main decision of the court was delivered by <a href="Nigel%20Bridge%2C%20Baron%20Bridge%20of%20Harwich">Bridge LJ</a>.

He considered carefully the earlier decision of "<a href="Aluminium%20Industrie%20Vaassen%20BV%20v%20Romalpa%20Aluminium%20Ltd">Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd</a>" [1976] 1 WLR 676 in relation to retention of title, and the decision in "<a href="Re%20Hallett%27s%20Estate">Re Hallett's Estate</a>" (1880) 13 Ch D 696 in relation to the right to <a href="tracing%20%28law%29">trace</a>.

He held that the process of working the resin destroyed that product, and the title of any person which was vested in it. Accordingly, the title which was retained under the agreement was extinguished. He went on to elaborate:

<a href="Denys%20Buckley">Buckley LJ</a> and <a href="Sydney%20Templeman%2C%20Baron%20Templeman">Templeman LJ</a> gave short concurring judgments. They added in their judgment that acquiring title in the worked product would generally result in the interest being treated as an equitable charge, which would be void if not properly registered under the <a href="Companies%20Act%201948">Companies Act 1948</a> (now the <a href="Companies%20Act%202006">Companies Act 2006</a>).

Authority.
The case is still accepted as authoritative today.

maturity, with a great music score (Ustad Shujat Hussain Khan and Sharang Dev) to
translate the emotional quotient on to the screen, makes it a decent watch.’

In May 2014, Mediente began shooting the documentary Battle for Banaras in
Banaras that covered prime minister Narendra Modi’s Lok Sabha election and
captured the excitement, the madness and the noise behind the high- octane poll
battle in the holy city.

Inspired by Nobel laureate Elias Canetti's book, 'Crowds and Power', Battle for
Banaras is directed by Kamal Swaroop and was shot in 4K, over a 44-day schedule
in Banaras. The film was screened in competition at the prestigious Cinema Du Reel
Film Festival, one of the most respected documentary film festivals in the world in
2016.

The documentary was screened for the censor board on August 27th 2015. It was
officially invited to play at the 17th Jio Mami Mumbai Film Festival but the invitation
was withdrawn in the absence of clarity on the censor certificate. After a radio
silence, the censor board on 17th October 2015refused to grant censor certificate
on the grounds that the release of the film may cause communal disharmony unrest
and disturbance.

“The theme is full of hate speeches/inflammatory speeches given by all the leaders
falls on different cast, communal talks, derogatory remarks,” states the letter. The
censor certificate has been denied under guidelines section 2(xii), (xvii), (xiii), (xviii)”.

The producers then approached FCAT. In its 4th April 2016 order, the tribunal
upheld the censor board’s decision to ban the documentary.

Manu Kumaran, the producer of the documentary moved the Delhi High Court on
Tuesday 31st May, 2016 against Central board of certification and Film Certification
Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) decision not to grant certificate to the documentary.

The writ petition argued that Impugned order dated April 4th of FCAT (upholding
censor board’s ruling) is arbitrary, unreasonable and infringes on Manu Kumaran’s
fundamental rights. It seeks quashing of the order and direction from the
honourable court to the respondents to sanction and issue a certificate for universal
viewing and public exhibition of the film. Ashim Sood has filed the writ on behalf of
Kumaran.

The judgement is expected.

Mediente is remaking the hit Hindi film Queen in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and
Malayalam. The Kannada version was launched in Bangalore on 7th June, 2017 on
actress Parul Yadav’s birthday, who is also essaying the lead role. Amy Jackson has
been shortlisted to essay role played by Lisa Hayden in original in all the four
languages. Ramesh Aravind is directing the Kannada and Tamil versions of the film.
Mamta Sagar is the dialogue writer for Kannada version while Tamil dialogues are
being written by T Sumathy.

15 Minutes de guerre

«15 Minutes de guerre» is a film by director Fred Grivois.

It tells of the real facts that took place in 1976 in <a href="Djibouti">Djibouti</a>. "On February 3, a school bus pick-up from the air base, aboard the children, is taken hostage and stops a few meters from the <a href="Somalia">Somali</a> border. An unknown elite unit, the <a href="GIGN">GIGN</a>, is sent on site. After thirty hours of tension, a rescue operation is decided, "says the synopsis of the film. In a note of intent, the director describes that the film is a "slow-burner", an entertaining thriller that takes place in an extreme environment.

"It's a realistic story, driven by the humanity of its characters, immersing the viewer in a continuous suspense for almost a hundred minutes. The realization will be sober and simple, it will fade before the text and the actors. We will shoot in long and moving sequences in order to highlight the dialogues and the play of the actors. The action scenes will have a separate treatment. Shoulder-to-shoulder and long-shot shots to capture the violence, difficulty and exhaustion that ensues.

The goal here is to create a powerful and captivating narration while creating a strong visual dynamic. " Fred Grivois has cast several French film figures, including <a href="Olga%20Kurylenko">Olga Kurylenko</a>, a model and actress of Ukrainian origin, seen in the film "<a href="Oblivion%20%282013%20film%29">Oblivion</a>" and "<a href="Quantum%20of%20Solace">James Bond: Quantum of Solace</a>.

Career.
Bechem United.
Signing a two-year contract to lead <a href="Bechem%20United">Bechem United</a> in 2014, he was lauded by the team CEO as perfect for the club due to his ‘training methods’ and ‘tactical ingenuity’ just a month after his arrival.

Following his departure from the club, he had relished for another spell at <a href="Bechem%20United">Bechem</a> despite the fact he was already at <a href="Medeama%20SC">Medeama SC</a> by then.

The Ghanaian media propagated rumors that Strand was going to sign for <a href="Hearts%20of%20Oak">Hearts of Oak</a> (while he was still with <a href="Medeama%20SC">Medeama</a>) which never happened even though they had sent a letter to <a href="Medeama%20SC">Medeama</a> regarding a possible appointment of him as their coach.

Skylar Prockner

Skylar Prockner (born May, 1998) is a Canadian convicted murderer.

Prockner pled guilty to first degree murder when he brutally killed his ex-girlfriend, Hannah Leflar. The offence took place on January 12, 2015, in <a href="http%3A//www.regina.ca/residents/index.htm">Regina, Saskatchewan</a>, when Prockner was 16 years and 8 months of age. He was sentenced as an adult on July 6, 2017 to life in prison.

Early life.
Prockner experienced both physical and emotional abuse as a child. He also exhibited learning and behavioural difficulties in school. He and his family were offered significant professional assistance on numerous occasions. This help was always crisis centred and neither Prockner nor his family continued with the offered follow-up assistance or treatment opportunities once the emergency situation or difficulty had subsided.

When Prockner was six years of age he was referred to Child and Youth Services by his mother because his teacher was concerned that “Skylar was talking about killing himself and his friends as well as telling his teacher on a couple of occasions that he wanted to be a serial killer when he grew up”. Prockner's mother stated that this was just another example of teachers and professionals getting things wrong as she was the one who, in talking with the teacher, had said to her “If he wants to be a Chip and Dale dancer or serial killer I will support my kid”.

Prockner was again referred to Child and Youth Services in January 2007 when he was 8 ½ years of age. At that time, Prockner had been acting out at home and at school. He was receiving suspensions at school and his parents were reportedly receiving weekly calls about his behaviour such as swearing, throwing things and pushing kids. After such behaviours, Prockner would apparently tell his teachers that he was tired, or make excuses for his behaviour. In June 2007, Prockner was also back to threatening to kill himself and seemed unhappy.

In April 2008, when Prockner was ten years old, concerns about his low self-esteem and distress about body image and family dysfunction resulted in a psychiatric assessment being completed by Dr. Damodharan. Prockner was apparently denying suicidal ideations at that time but reported that he had thought of hurting himself a couple of times. Dr. Damodharan thought that possibly Prockner might be suffering from Dysthymia or chronic low grade depression. He made a referral to Child and Youth Services for counselling and suggested to his mother the possibility of pharmacological management of Prockner’s symptoms.

It was reported that there was no further contact with Child and Youth Services or with Dr. Damodharan in the subsequent six years. On September 15, 2014, about four months after his break up with Leflar, Prockner was admitted to the Adolescence Psychiatric Unit [APU] of the Regina General Hospital. He was brought to the hospital by his father. Prockner had called his father asking for help while he was sitting in his truck in the garage with everything set up to kill himself by carbon monoxide poisoning. He apparently had written suicide notes to Leflar and his family.

Prockner had received considerable support and intervention from his schools. This was particularly evident in the lower grades but even later. When Prockner began to re-attend high school while on day passes from the APU, Dr. Haque reported that the school was “going to great lengths to try and arrange a school program which would help him to graduate”. Unfortunately, Prockner did not maintain his school attendance after his discharge from the APU.

Dangerous brooding.
Prockner had quit school some months before the murder and was basically doing nothing but obsessively and dangerously brooding over the loss of his girlfriend. He was supposed to be residing primarily at his mother’s but she was unable to control him and he was apparently couch surfing.

Murder of hannah leflar.
On January 12, 2015, Prockner saw Facebook pictures of Leflar looking very happy with a new boyfriend. He became enraged and by approximately 1:00 a.m. in the early morning hours of January 12, 2015 Prockner made the decision that he was going to kill Leflar later that day. He enlisted the help of a friend whom he picked up from school at about 2:50 p.m. that day. He then drove with his friend to a location close to Leflar’s house and waited in his truck for her to arrive home. Both Prockner and his friend had knives in their possession. Prockner was wearing latex work gloves, dark jeans and a camouflage jacket as well as a face warmer with respirator around his neck.

Leflar arrived home from school between 3:30 and 3:45 p.m. Prockner entered Hannah’s home carrying an 11-inch buck knife in his right hand. Leflar saw Prockner in her kitchen, screamed his name, and started running to her parents’ bedroom where she tripped and fell. Prockner “jumped down beside her and began to stab her”. During the course of killing Leflar, Prockner stabbed himself in the left hand. At some point, his friend joined Prockner in the master bedroom. Once Leflar stopped moving, they left the bedroom. Prockner grabbed Leflar’s cell phone and the two of them got back in his truck and drove to the home of the friend’s girlfriend. Prockner concocted a story about his injured hand and was ultimately taken to the hospital for stitches where he relayed the same story about accidentally injuring himself while hunting.

Before leaving for the hospital, Prockner told his friend to smash Leflar’s cell phone. The girlfriend’s mother drove the boys to the hospital. Prockner’s father was called and arrived at the hospital with Prockner’s brother. Prockner’s father asked Prockner to drive his brother home so he could complete some errands. He drove both boys back to Prockner’s truck, which had been left at the house of his friend’s girlfriend. Prockner picked up his friend, who had earlier returned to the house, and drove the truck to McDonald’s. Prockner and his friend went in to get some food and left Prockner’s brother in the truck.

When Prockner and his friend returned to the truck, they drove to a nearby alley where Prockner told his friend to dispose of the knife in a dumpster along with the case from Leflar’s cell phone. Prockner quickly changed his mind, and then asked his friend to retrieve the items from the dumpster. His friend was able to locate the knife but not the cell phone cover. Prockner then dropped his friend off and he and his brother proceeded to visit their mother in Regina for a few minutes. They then drove to their father’s residence in Edenwold, Saskatchewan. On route, Prockner told his brother what he had done to Leflar and imitated for his brother the sound that Leflar made when she was dying. About two kilometres from his father’s home, Prockner stopped at an abandoned farm yard and disposed of the buck knife.

When Leflar’s step-father arrived home, he found her body in the master bedroom. Leflar’s family immediately suspected that Prockner was involved. That evening, the police attended at the residence of Prockner’s father and arrested Prockner for Leflar’s murder. He was taken in custody at the Paul Dojack Youth Centre [Dojack] in Regina, Saskatchewan on the evening of January 12, 2015.

Men in Black: The Game

Men in Black: The Game is a 1997 <a href="Adventure%20game">adventure</a> video game developed by Gigawatt Studios and published by <a href="SouthPeak%20Interactive">SouthPeak Interactive</a> for <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> and the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>. The game is loosely based on the 1997 film, "<a href="Men%20in%20Black%20%281997%20film%29">Men in Black</a>".

Gameplay.
"Men in Black: The Game" is an <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> played from a <a href="Third%20person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person perspective</a>, with fixed camera angles that change as the player moves to each new part of a level. The game is loosely based on the film, and is divided across four levels. Each level includes <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzles</a> that must be solved by the player to progress. The player's character can jump, kick, punch, examine items, and dodge attacks. The player must find key cards, deactivate security systems, and read messages to proceed through each level, while fighting enemies that include <a href="grey%20alien">grey alien</a>s, large bugs, and spore frogs. Eight weapons are featured in the game, including the <a href="neuralyzer">neuralyzer</a> and <a href="Noisy%20Cricket">Noisy Cricket</a>, both from the film. Only one weapon can be used for each level. Fist fights against enemies occur frequently due to a limited amount of ammunition. The Windows version does not support the use of a <a href="gamepad">gamepad</a>.

The game's first level follows the film's opening sequence, as the player controls James Edwards (portrayed by <a href="Will%20Smith">Will Smith</a> in the film), a New York City detective who is sent to investigate a robbery. Edwards is subsequently renamed <a href="Agent%20J">Agent J</a> when he is recruited into the <a href="Men%20in%20Black">Men in Black</a> organization, which monitors <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial</a>s living on Earth. For the next three levels, the player chooses between three characters: Agent J, <a href="Agent%20K">Agent K</a>, or Agent L (the latter two portrayed in the film by <a href="Tommy%20Lee%20Jones">Tommy Lee Jones</a> and <a href="Linda%20Fiorentino">Linda Fiorentino</a>). The story remains the same regardless of the chosen character. The final three levels use a plot that is unrelated to the film. The second level takes place at a deserted <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> weather station, while the third level involves an investigation into a <a href="Chupacabra">Chupacabra</a> living in an <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon</a> mine. The game ends with the player facing off against computer expert Skip Frales at his private estate, located on the fictional Frales Island in the northwest <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>.

Development and release.
Gigawatt Studios had been interested in creating a "Men in Black" video game before the film was completed. <a href="SouthPeak%20Interactive">SouthPeak Interactive</a> announced the game in 1997, with plans to release it for <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> on November 25 of that year, to coincide with the home video release of the film. Actors who appeared in the film had their faces <a href="Texture%20mapping">texture mapped</a> onto the game's character models. The game uses more than 200 backgrounds that were <a href="Pre-rendering">pre-rendered</a>, while the model characters are made up of 500 <a href="Polygon%20mesh">polygons</a>. The Windows version was released in the United States on November 18, 1997.

Reception.
Steve Poole of "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" criticized the Windows version for its short length, its "strained attempts to duplicate the film's humor," and its lack of gamepad support. Poole wrote, "Serious gamers will be dissatisfied with the lack of depth, and casual gamers lured by the movie tie-in will be left cold by the game's average graphics and lethargic voice-acting."

Lauren Fielder of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> criticized the game's <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a> and poor controls, and wrote that the game might have been more fun if "you could at least run quickly." Fielder also criticized problems involving the player's ability to perform certain actions: "Unless you are lined up directly in front of your object, you can't act. And jumps are quite improbable even once you align yourself; for example, you can't hop up on a box unless you're right in front of it." Fielder concluded that "it's quite obvious the time and energy went into set design and mediocre character animations, not into actually making the game work." Fielder noted that the sound effects in the first level were "fairly interesting," but that "it too goes downhill, with your character's insistent one-liners and the endlessly looped 'climatic moment' music churning in the background."

Calvin Hubble of <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> noted the poor artificial intelligence, but praised the character animations for bearing resemblance to their film counterparts, and wrote that the graphics were "decent enough to pass." However, Hubble noted that each of the game's menus and loading screens "have an extremely simple, bold, solid-color font. […] I could have made a better interface given <a href="Photoshop">Photoshop</a> and about a day." Kim Randell of "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" called the game's first level "incredibly pedantic," and wrote, "The combat system is fiddly, and the murky backgrounds sometimes make your grasp of the scene less than complete. Later on it looks and sounds cool, but with a continuing frustration factor."

John Altman of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" wrote, "As an action/adventure game, "MiB" is a qualified success – fairly entertaining but thoroughly unoriginal. As the latest product from the "Men In Black" franchise, the game is a disappointment; the original spirit has been lost, replaced by occasional wit and generous doses of carnage." Altman concluded, "Hardcore fans of "MiB" will be disappointed to discover that the game is fairly pedestrian and generic, but gamers know that few things in life go together as well as killing aliens and making droll remarks. There's fun to be found here; it's just a matter of keeping your expectations reasonable."

Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials

In the wake of the <a href="Charleston%20church%20shooting">Charleston church shooting</a> in June 2015, several municipalities in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> removed monuments and memorials dedicated to the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>, which before the Civil War had supported the continuation of slavery. The momentum accelerated in August 2017 after the <a href="Unite%20the%20Right%20rally">Unite the Right rally</a> in <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville, Virginia</a> (a white supremacist protest against the removal of a Confederate monument) turned violent.

The removals were driven by the assertion that the monuments glorify and perpetuate <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a>. However, many of those who object to the removals claim that the artifacts are part of the <a href="cultural%20heritage">cultural heritage</a> of the United States. The monuments have thus become highly politicised; according to Eleanor Harvey, a senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and a scholar of Civil War history: "“If white nationalists and neo-Nazis are now claiming this as part of their heritage, they have essentially co-opted those images and those statues beyond any capacity to neutralize them again”".

Many of the Confederate monuments concerned were built in periods of racial conflict, such as when <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a> were being introduced in the late 19th century and at the start of the 20th century or during the <a href="African-American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement%20%281954%E2%80%931968%29">Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.</a> The peak in construction of Civil War Monuments ocurred between the late 1890s up to 1920, with a second, smaller peak in the late 1950s to mid 1960s.

Adam Goodheart, Civil War author and director of the Starr Center at <a href="Washington%20College">Washington College</a> sets the context for many of the monuments in National Geographic "“They’re 20th-century artifacts in the sense that a lot of it had to do with a vision of national unity that embraced Southerners as well as Northerners, but importantly still excluded black people.”" 

History.
The removals were marked by events in Louisiana and Virginia within the span of two years. In Louisiana, after the <a href="Charleston%20church%20shooting">Charleston church shooting</a> of 2015, the city removed its Confederate memorials two years later. A few months later, in August 2017, a state of emergency was declared in Virginia after a <a href="Unite%20the%20Right%20rally">Unite the Right rally</a> against the removal of the <a href="Robert%20Edward%20Lee%20Sculpture">"Robert Edward Lee" statue</a> in <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville</a> turned violent.

Other events followed across the United States. In Baltimore, for example, the city's Confederate statutes were removed on the night of August 15–16, 2017. Mayor <a href="Catherine%20Pugh">Catherine Pugh</a> said that she ordered the overnight removals to preserve public safety. Similarly, in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, Mayor <a href="Jim%20Gray%20%28American%20politician%29">Jim Gray</a> asked the city council on August 16, 2017 to approve the relocation of two statues from a courthouse. A different event occurred in <a href="Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina">Durham, North Carolina</a> where several protesters toppled the <a href="Confederate%20Soldiers%20Monument%20%28Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina%29">Confederate Soldiers Monument</a> outside the Old Durham County Courthouse on August 15, 2017. Eight activists were arrested in connection with the illegal action.

A plaque in a <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> store commemorating <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>' brief stay in the city was installed by the <a href="United%20Daughters%20of%20the%20Confederacy">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a> in 1957; it was removed following the Charlottesville rally, under pressure from the public.

Legal disputes.
In August 2017, immediately after <a href="William%20A.%20Bell">William A. Bell</a>, the mayor of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, Alabama, draped a <a href="List%20of%20monuments%20and%20memorials%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America%23Alabama">Confederate memorial</a> with plastic and surrounded it with plywood with the rationale "This country should in no way tolerate the hatred that the KKK, neo-Nazis, fascists and other hate groups spew", Alabama Attorney General, Steve Marshall, sued Bell and the city for violating a <a href="Alabama%20Memorial%20Preservation%20Act">state law</a> that prohibits the "relocation, removal, alteration, or other disturbance of any monument on public property that has been in place for 40 years or more". The law does not explicitly prohibit the covering up of such statues.

Academic debate.
According to historian Adam Goodheart, the statues were meant to be symbols of white supremacy and the rallying around them by white supremacists will likely hasten their demise. <a href="Elijah%20Anderson">Elijah Anderson</a>, a professor of sociology at Yale University, said the statues "really impacts the psyche of black people." <a href="Harold%20Holzer">Harold Holzer</a>, the director of the <a href="Roosevelt%20House%20Public%20Policy%20Institute%20at%20Hunter%20College">Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College</a>, agreed that the statues were designed to belittle African Americans. However, he added that "a lot of the art is really good."

<a href="Eric%20Foner">Eric Foner</a>, a professor of history, argued the Confederate statues should remain, and more statues should be installed, including statues of African-Americans like <a href="Nat%20Turner">Nat Turner</a>. <a href="Alfred%20Brophy">Alfred Brophy</a>, a professor of law at the University of Alabama, argued the removal of the Confederate statues "facilitates forgetting."

Bartley-Fox Law

The Bartley-Fox Law (also known as the Bartley-Fox Amendment) is a law passed by the <a href="Massachusetts%20General%20Court">Massachusetts General Court</a> in 1974, and which took effect in April 1975. It mandates a one-year prison sentence for anyone convicted of possession of a <a href="firearm">firearm</a> without a license in the state of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. It was co-sponsored by, and named after, Massachusetts state legislators <a href="David%20M.%20Bartley">David M. Bartley</a> and <a href="J.%20John%20Fox">J. John Fox</a>. When it took effect, it was the first such law ever to be enacted in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. The law was accompanied by extensive publicity of the fact that the ban on unlicensed possession of handguns would now be strictly enforced. Two months before the law took effect, as part of this publicity campaign, <a href="TV%20spot">TV spot</a>s aired with the slogan "If you are caught with a gun, you will go to prison for a year and nobody can get you out."
Effects.
In 1976, <a href="James%20Vorenberg">James Vorenberg</a> released a report concluding that in the one year since the Bartley-Fox Law had taken effect, the law had not significantly affected <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>' violent crime rate, nor had it significantly reduced the rate at which guns were used in robberies and other premeditated crimes. A 1977 study by James A. Beha, II concluded that after the law had taken effect, people were being sentenced to prison for illegally carrying firearms five times more often than before it had taken effect. His findings also indicated that criminal justice officials did not frequently attempt to evade the mandatory sentences imposed by the law; instead, people charged with illegal carrying of firearms were generally either convicted in accordance with the law, or were found not guilty. Another 1977 study by Deutsch and Alt reported that the law was associated with a decline in gun assaults and armed robberies, though this finding has been challenged by other researchers. In 1979, <a href="Glenn%20L.%20Pierce">Glenn L. Pierce</a>, <a href="William%20J.%20Bowers">William J. Bowers</a>, and other researchers reported that the law reduced the rate of gun assault and armed robbery in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, and that it also had the unintended effect of increasing citizens' reporting of crime there. Similarly, Pierce and Bowers reported in 1981 that the law reduced the rate of gun assaults and criminal homicides in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, but that the punishments actually imposed by the law did not seem to be responsible for this reduction. They also reported that the decline in gun assaults was more than offset by an increase in non-gun armed assaults. 

In 1983, <a href="James%20Q.%20Wilson">James Q. Wilson</a> argued in "<a href="the%20Atlantic">the Atlantic</a>" that In his 1997 book "Targeting Guns: Firearms and Their Control", <a href="Gary%20Kleck">Gary Kleck</a> argues that even if one assumes that the Bartley-Fox Law was effective in reducing crime in Massachusetts, this may not mean that different mandatory sentencing gun-carrying laws would be effective if they were implemented elsewhere. A 2004 <a href="National%20Research%20Council">National Research Council</a> report concluded that "Collectively, this body of research seems to suggest [that the Bartley-Fox Law had] a broad impact on gun crime in Boston. However, it is unclear whether the firearms sentencing enhancement or the mandatory sentence for illegal gun-carrying generated the impact."

Elizabeth Lee Wheaton (b. 1902) was an American novelist.

"Mr. George's Joint".
Wheaton's first novel, "Mr. George's Joint", was a decorated and controversial novel depicting African-American life in the American South. The award citation when the novel won the 1941 Thomas Jefferson Southern Award for the best book manuscript by a Southern author said the novel had "artistic truth and rich human appeal" unusual in its depiction of African-American life compared to other fictions which present African-Americans as "quaint and sentimental" or "falsified ... for purposes of social reform."

Denys Corley Smith

Denys Corley Smith (9 June 1922 – 21 February 1989). Journalist and author.

Early life.
Corley Smith was born 9 June 1922 in <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, the younger son of Thomas Smith (born 1874 -) a teacher, and Nina Alice Brown (born 1887 -). Their first son was <a href="Gerard%20Corley%20Smith">Gerald Thomas Corley Smith</a> who went on to become a British diplomat.

In the 1930s, he took a modern languages degree at <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>. During the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> he fought with the <a href="Manchester%20Regiment">Manchester Regiment</a> in Italy. The Manchesters saw much action during the Battles for the Gothic Line in August–September 1944, including the Battle of Montegridolfo. At the end of the War he began a newsman’s career initially editing a frontline newspaper for the military.

Journalism.
In the early 1950s he joined <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> as a correspondent in Asia. His first assignment was covering the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and he then moved to Saigon until 1956, and then took various other posts before becoming freelance in 1963. He continued to write for a variety of publications and journals including "This is Japan" where he wrote an article on the <a href="Katakana">Katakana</a> where he mentions that he was a regular visitor to Tokyo.

Author.
Corley Smith's first novel was "Two Drops of Blood" published by <a href="Ernest%20Benn">Ernest Benn</a>, in 1959. In reviews, this was described as a fast moving novel about the day-to-day lives of foreign correspondents. It is set in Vietnam against the background of the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">Indo-China War</a>.

"The Deep-Freeze Girls" was written in collaboration with Eva Defago and was first published by <a href="Michael%20Joseph%20%28publisher%29">Michael Joseph</a> in the UK, in 1964. An alumni herself. Eva Defago and Corley Smith took the lid off a girls' finishing schools in Switzerland in a comic novel that takes on increasing overtones of pathos as it moves along. "The common “dumping” of wealthy teenage girls from throughout the world into the deep freeze of a Swiss finishing school such as the fictional Pensionnat de Jeunes Filles Villa Joyeuse by what the author regards as “thoughtless, selfish parents” has prompted her to write the book. It’s entertaining, if somewhat sensational, and the story is balanced and told with the sometimes amusing idiom of youth." Dafago was said to have run a hotel in the Swiss Alps and was an alumni of such schools.

The novel became a minor best seller and there were plans to turn it into a film starring <a href="Nancy%20Kwan">Nancy Kwan</a>, <a href="Sue%20Lyon">Sue Lyon</a> and <a href="Grayson%20Hall">Grayson Hall</a>, and directed by Zoe Clarke-Williams.

<a href="Jay%20Weston">Jay Weston</a> is quoted as saying, '<a href="Ray%20Stark">Ray Stark</a> and I once developed a movie called "The Deep Freeze Girls", based upon the novel about a group of spoiled rich girls in a posh boarding school in Switzerland. It was never made when we could not get a suitable script"

Corley Smith is also quoted in the 1967 edition of "This is Japan" that he had written or was writing a book called "Maiko" dealing with <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>’s apprentice <a href="geisha">geisha</a> but no record of a published book has been found.

Death.
Corley Smith died 21 February 1989 in <a href="Loxton">Loxton</a> <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, aged 66.

History.

Successful, they returned to the Caribbean the following year. In May 1685 Goffe and Henley arrived in <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> with a Dutch prize ship. Governor Cony tried to have Henley arrested but his own citizens and soldiers refused to prosecute him and Cony was forced to release Henley. Though Henley had a privateering commission from Governor Lilburne of the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, the governments of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> publicly proclaimed both Henley and Goffe to be pirates. Goffe was prolific enough in the area that a small island was named for him, known as <a href="Goff%27s%20Caye">Goff's Caye</a>; another nearby island was named for pirate <a href="Joseph%20Bannister">Joseph Bannister</a>.

Woolerly sailed to <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a> in June 1687 asking to resupply. He announced that he had Goffe aboard, having taken him in when he was in dire need of assistance. Because Goffe had been named as a pirate, Woolerly was denied entrance, despite having his own commission from Lilburne. Instead Woolerly left and sailed to Andrews Island where he burned his ship, shared out his loot, and purchased another vessel to return to <a href="New%20England">New England</a>.

Goffe made his way to Boston, and “in a very sick and weak condition” asked for and received a pardon for his piracies in late 1687. Goffe, members of Henley’s crew, and others admitted to having been pirates, but were not prosecuted for lack of evidence and witnesses, and were allowed to keep their treasure.

By August 1691 Goffe had been commissioned as a privateer by <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> Governor <a href="Simon%20Bradstreet">Simon Bradstreet</a>. Assigned to patrol <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a> and <a href="Cape%20Ann">Cape Ann</a>, he was tasked with bringing in pirates <a href="George%20Dew">George Dew</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Griffin%20%28pirate%29">Thomas Griffin</a>.

Pickle (app)

Pickle is a location-based, <a href="online%20marketplace">mobile marketplace app</a> that matches freelance labor with tasks posted by other users. The concept behind Pickle is to provide a streamlined, <a href="peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> platform that allows users to complete jobs for one another, while challenging the sigma of seeking help by incorporating social media. Users can negotiate how tasks are completed as well as payment, which is processed through <a href="PayPal">PayPal</a>. Pickle takes a 10% commission from the both users in each transaction.

One unique feature of the app is the ability to facilitate dares which users are then rewarded for completing. Examples include shaving one's head or streaking in public.

Pickle has been compared to rival services <a href="TaskRabbit">TaskRabbit</a> and Handy, however the integration of social media and commenting allows for more flexible transactions than an other services, according to the creators. The app is specifically targeted at <a href="Millennials">Millennials</a> and <a href="Generation%20Z">Generation Z</a>.

Development.
Pickle founder Daneh Westropp was inspired to create the app after herself running away from home and school at the age of 15 and discovering a niche for <a href="Millennials">Millennials</a> wanting to make money while remaining independent. According to Westropp, Pickle aims to remedy the "boring interactions with the consumer" found on rival platforms by being "a social platform for jobs". The app's name refers to the ability of on-demand, outsourced labour to get oneself out of a 'pickle'.

The app was launched on <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> in June, 2015, to widespread acclaim from publications including <a href="Gizmodo">Gizmodo</a> and <a href="ShortList">ShortList</a>. Pickle gained over 1,500 user registrations in its first month of operation, the majority of whom are in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. In its first year, the company expanded to include four staff, with an additional network of freelancers covering PR, design, legal and accounting. Since launching, the app has attracted several angel investors included Frederic Hofmann, director at venture capital and advisory firm Anthemis Group which specialises in <a href="fintech">fintech</a> startups.

In January 2017 Pickle was relaunched on <a href="iOS">iOS</a>, with an updated <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> app currently under development. Within months the userbase grew to over 90,000 people around the world.

Features.
As the app does not impose a definition of what a job is, users are free to request everything from mundane tasks to elaborate dares. Pickle uses <a href="geolocation">geolocation</a> to connect users located near each other, however jobs which do not require physical presence can be completed from anywhere. Pickle users are divided into two groups: Do and Need. Users who "do" are those looking to complete jobs for payment, whereas users who "need" are those who post job listings.

Each job listing includes several criteria such as a deadline for completion or specific instructions. Other users can then bid to be accepted for the job. As the payment can be advertised from the beginning, the bidding process also incorporates completion time and quality of execution, as well as users asking questions about the job. Job-posters are also able to cover additional costs of purchasing items that might be needed to complete their task, so as not to leave the user completing the job out of pocket.

Users looking to complete jobs can search on a map for opportunities near them. The app includes a filtering system through which users can search only for jobs matching their specific skillset, such as hairdressing or handyman work. These skillsets can also be viewed by job-posters, giving them insight into the background and abilities of each bidder. Users can also choose to be notified if a job is advertised matching their skillset, location and price range.

Pickle also links with users' <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> profiles, while additional social features allow users to negotiate payment either publicly or privately. Users who have successfully bid to complete a job can also make phone calls with the job-poster. Other social features include public comment threads on each job listing, the use of hashtags, and galleries on users' profile pages.

Some of Henley’s crew left his ship while in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, sailing back to the Caribbean and then to <a href="New%20England">New England</a> with Woolerly. They were tried for piracy (which they openly admitted) but were acquitted for lack of evidence and witnesses, and were allowed to keep their treasure.

By 1684 he was back in the Caribbean, where <a href="buccaneer">buccaneer</a> and privateer <a href="Bartholomew%20Sharp">Bartholomew Sharp</a> captured him and took his 18-gun, 100-man frigate "Resolution", renaming it "Josiah". Henley’s ship was formerly called "Baldivia" when Henley captured it from the Spanish. Sharp was accused of piracy for taking Henley’s ship without presenting it to an <a href="Admiralty%20Court">Admiralty Court</a> for confirmation, but he was acquitted.

The following year Henley and Goffe put in at <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> in possession of a Dutch prize ship, taken on a privateering commission from Governor Lilburne of the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. Bermudan Governor Cony imprisoned Henley and tried to seize the ship, but everyone from the local militia leaders to the sheriff to the Governor’s own Council members resisted prosecuting Henley and Cony was forced to release him. Cony lamented that “it is the intention of the people to make this island a pirates’ refuge.” Henley was afterwards pronounced a pirate by the government of Jamaica, and warned Cony that more pirates were coming. There are few records of his subsequent activities.

What Were We Thinking Of

"What Were We Thinking Of" is a song recorded by American singer <a href="Barbra%20Streisand">Barbra Streisand</a> for her twenty-ninth studio album, "<a href="Till%20I%20Loved%20You%20%28album%29">Till I Loved You</a>" (1988). It was released as the album's third and final single in February 1989 by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. The track was written by <a href="Antonina%20Armato">Antonina Armato</a> and Scott Cutler and produced by Denny Diante. It features guest vocals from the singer's then-boyfriend <a href="Don%20Johnson">Don Johnson</a>, who had previously collaborated with Streisand on her 1988 single "<a href="Till%20I%20Loved%20You%20%28song%29">Till I Loved You</a>".

The physical release of "What Were We Thinking Of" includes the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side track</a> "Why Let It Go?", which is also featured on the parent album. A <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a> song, the track is about the end of a relationship that has, over time, soured. Critically, the song was well received with several <a href="Music%20criticism">music critics</a> calling it one of the best tracks on "Till I Loved You".

Recording and release.
"What Were We Thinking Of" was taken from Streisand's twenty-ninth studio album, "<a href="Till%20I%20Loved%20You%20%28album%29">Till I Loved You</a>" (1988). The song was written by <a href="Antonina%20Armato">Antonina Armato</a> and Scott Cutler, and it was one of the first songs written by Armato. While recording songs for the album, Streisand's then-boyfriend <a href="Don%20Johnson">Don Johnson</a>, decided to serve as a featured artist on the album's <a href="title%20track">title track</a>, "<a href="Till%20I%20Loved%20You%20%28song%29">Till I Loved You</a>". The singer remarked that she enjoyed duetting with him because he is "very musical and has a unique sounding voice"; she also was interested in their collaborations due to the fact that he was able "act" out the lyrics while singing. Because of the success they had found while creating the aforementioned track, it was decided that Johnson would also lend his voice for background vocals on "What Were We Thinking Of". In order to return the favor to him, Streisand would later contribute guest vocals for his second studio album, "<a href="Let%20It%20Roll%20%28Don%20Johnson%20album%29">Let It Roll</a>" (1989).

The track was released by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> in February 1989 as the final of the three singles from "Till I Loved You". The standard <a href="Gramophone%20record">7"</a> single and <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette</a> single features <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side track</a> "Why Let It Go?", which was taken from the parent album. A promotional version of the release, exclusive to the United States, used "What Were We Thinking Of" as both the A-side and B-side on the 7" record. In Spain, a single-sided format featuring just the album version of the song was also created. 

Lyrics and production.
Like the bulk of the songs on "Till I Loved You", "What Were We Thinking Of" is a "nontheatrical <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a> song". According to the official sheet music published by the <a href="Warner%20Music%20Group">Warner Music Group</a>, the song is written in the key of <a href="B%20major">B major</a> with a moderately fast beat consisting of 138 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. Since "Till I Loved You" is a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a> based on the beginnings and ends of relationships, "What Were We Thinking Of" was placed towards the end of the album's track listing where the accompanying songs' lyrics discuss break-ups and how to move on in life from them. Streisand sings, "Where did we go wrong? Is it really over? / Where does my heart belong if it's not with you?". To accompany the production, a number of instruments are present on the track, including a saxophone played by Dave Boruff, a guitar played by <a href="Michael%20Thompson%20%28guitarist%29">Michael Thompson</a>, and drums played by <a href="Randy%20Waldman">Randy Waldman</a> and Cutler.

Critical reception.
Responses from <a href="Music%20criticism">music critics</a> suggested that "What Were We Thinking Of" was a standout track on "Till I Loved You". Paul Grein, a writer for "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", considered the song and "Some Good Things Never Last" as the two best cuts on side two of the parent album. Despite claiming that Streisand's album varied deeply in terms of quality, author Allison J. Waldman, who wrote "The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook" in 2001, listed the single in addition to album tracks "On My Way to You" and "Two People" as the three "especially fine cuts" included on "Till I Loved You".

Rue de la Petite-Truanderie

Rue de la Petite-Truanderie ("street in Little Truanderie") is an old path, in the 1  <a href="Quarters%20of%20Paris">District of Paris</a> , in <a href="France">France</a>.

Origin of name.
The exact origin of the name is not known, but there are two thesis:

Location.
In 1817, the "Rue de la Petite-Truanderie", a length of 52 <a href="Metre">meters</a>, began at number 16-18 rue Mondétour and finished at number 13-18 rue de la Grande-Truanderie. It was located in the former 5 district in the Montorgueil.

The numbers in the street were black one. The last number were odd number 15 and the last was the even number number 16.

Currently, part of the 1  district Halles district , with a length of 34 meters, began at number 16 Mondetour Street and ends at number 11 Rue Pierre Lescot and Rue de la Grande Truanderie.

History.
The Rue de la Petite-Truanderie, like Rue de la Grande-Truanderie, was already built in 1250. Its location was formerly part of the small <a href="Th%C3%A9rouanne">fief of Thérouenne</a>, about half of which was ceded to <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philippe-Auguste</a> by Adam, <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> of <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, then Bishop of <a href="Th%C3%A9rouanne">Thérouenne</a>. 

<a href="Robert%20C%C3%A9neau">Robert Cenalis</a>, in his History of France, dedicated in 1555 to <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II</a> , named the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie Via Mendicatrix minor. She also wore the street names of Puits-d'Amour and Rue de l'Ariane .

It is quoted in "Le Dit des Streets of Paris" by <a href="Guillot%20of%20Paris">Guillot de Paris</a> under the name Rue de la Petite-Truanderie.

A ministerial decision of 28 Prairial year IX (17 June 1801), signed chaptal fixes that the least width of this public road be 10.5 meters.

At the junction of Pirouette, Mondetour, La Petite-Truanderie and Grande-Truanderie streets were the crossroads of the tower on which the "Puits-d'Amour" was located. 

It forms the south side of a triangular square, the north side of which is formed by the Rue de la Grande-Truanderie and the west by Mondétour Street. Formerly, this square was occupied by buildings.

Access.
The street in Little Truanderie is served by the line at the metro station "Les Halles" , by the station <a href="Ch%C3%A2telet%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29">Châtelet</a> - <a href="Les%20Halles%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29">Les Halles</a>.

The area received protection in 1988 "to preserve an important wetland area with its appertaining plant communities, bird life, and other wildlife," according to the conservation regulations. The reserve consists of a small shallow pond surrounded by marsh and cultivated land. It is a nesting area for wetland birds and is also an area that birds pass through during migration. Two bird species that nest here are of international importance, six species are of national importance, and 11 species (of which eight nest here) are of regional importance. The landscape is partially covered by rich vegetation where there is shell sand, and there is a wind-blown sand area that is relatively unique to the region. The nature reserve lies a little bit south of <a href="%C3%85lesund%20Airport%2C%20Vigra">Ålesund Airport</a>. Traffic is not permitted in the area from April to August.

Ivo de Vento

Ivo de Vento (* circa 1544 in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>; † <a href="3.%20September">3. September</a> <a href="1575">1575</a> in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>) was a <a href="Franco-Flemish%20School">Franco-Flemish</a> <a href="composer">composer</a>, <a href="organist">organist</a> and "<a href="Kapellmeister">Kapellmeister</a>" of the <a href="High%20Renaissance">High Renaissance</a>.

Life.
From numerous receipts sent to his father in Antwerp it is known that Ivo de Vento was present at the ducal court of <a href="Albert%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Albert V</a> in Munich around September 1556 or a little later, one of a number of <a href="boys%27%20choir">boy singers</a> recruited from the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>, possibly chosen by <a href="Orlando%20di%20Lasso">Orlando di Lasso</a>. He was employed under "Hofkapellmeister" <a href="Ludwig%20Daser">Ludwig Daser</a> until September 1559, when his <a href="Vocal%20mutation">voice broke</a> and he was given a stipend to study in Venice. Presumably his teachers would have included <a href="Claudio%20Merulo">Claudio Merulo</a>, the organist at <a href="St%20Mark%27s%2C%20Venice">San Marco</a>, and <a href="Annibale%20Padovano">Annibale Padovano</a>. Italian influence is evident in a 6-part "<a href="Battaglia">Battaglia</a>" printed in a Venetian anthology of 1564. In 1563 he returned to Munich as organist, a post shared with two Italian colleagues in the newly expanded <a href="kapelle">"Hofkapelle"</a> now led by <a href="Orlando%20di%20Lasso">Orlando di Lasso</a>. Vento was fostered by the famous composer, as shown by inclusion of his work in a collection of 6-part masses (1564/65) as well as the 1569 Madrigals and its 1575 sequel.

In summer of 1568 the crown price <a href="Wilhelm%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Wilhelm V</a>, having married <a href="Renata%20of%20Lorraine">Renata of Lorraine</a>, moved part of the court to <a href="Landshut">Landshut</a> and made Vento director of the affiliated "kapelle". For unknown reasons this position was taken over a year later by <a href="Antonius%20Gosswin">Antonius Gosswin</a>, Vento remaining as organist and director of the boys, among whom was <a href="Leonhard%20Lechner">Leonhard Lechner</a>. Vento was back at the Munich court as organist at the start of 1570, months before the dissolution of the Landshut "Kapelle". Though Lasso's letters give no evidence, Vento could have studied with him, since the masses found in mss of the 1560s and 70's show his influence, and a number of the 5-part "Latinae cantiones" (1570) are on texts also set by Lasso. Nevertheless, his style is not especially dependent on Lasso's. From 1569 on Vento was unusually productive, the Munich printer <a href="Adam%20Berg">Adam Berg</a> issuing 11 collections, including four volumes of motets and a "Viersprachendruck", a title which alludes to Lasso's own four-language publication.

Ivo de Vento died in Munich in September 1575, barely 31 years old and leaving a widow and at least one son, Ferdinand de Venndo. Ferdinand succeeded him at the Munich court, became trumpeter to Archduke <a href="Ferdinand%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Ferdinand</a> in Graz in 1599 and remained in the Emperor's service, dying in 1623.

Jeri Ah-be-hill (September 23, 1933-March 11, 2015) was a <a href="Kiowa">Kiowa</a>-<a href="Comanche">Comanche</a> fashion expert. She owned and operated a trading post on the the <a href="Wind%20River%20Indian%20Reservation">Wind River Indian Reservation</a> for over twenty years before moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico where she became the curator of the annual Native American Clothing Contest held at the <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Indian%20Market">Santa Fe Indian Market</a>. She also worked as a <a href="docent">docent</a> at both the <a href="Institute%20of%20American%20Indian%20Arts">Institute of American Indian Arts</a> and the <a href="Wheelwright%20Museum%20of%20the%20American%20Indian">Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian</a>. Considered an expert on Native American fashion, she traveled both nationally and internationally presenting educational information about tribal clothing.

Early life.
Geraldine Fuller was born on September 23, 1933 in <a href="Apache%2C%20Oklahoma">Apache, Oklahoma</a> to Sarah (née Ataumbi) and Earl Fuller. Her mother was a member of the <a href="Kiowa%20Tribe%20of%20Oklahoma">Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma</a> and her father was a member of the <a href="Comanche%20Nation">Comanche Nation</a>. She was a great-niece of the noted Kiowa artist <a href="Silver%20Horn">Silver Horn</a>. Fuller studied at <a href="American%20Indian%20boarding%20schools">Riverside Indian School</a> in <a href="Anadarko%2C%20Oklahoma">Anadarko</a>, becoming involved in Native American apparel when she was asked to model in 1951 at the fashion show of the <a href="Peoria%2C%20Illinois">Peoria, Illinois</a> Indian Arts and Crafts Association. From the age of twenty-one, she wore nothing but American Indian-inspired clothing. She attended courses at the <a href="University%20of%20Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a> in the early 1950s, before moving to <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, where she worked at <a href="McQuay-Norris">McQuay-Norris</a>. In 1954, Fuller married Richard Greeves, an artist and the couple moved to <a href="Fort%20Washakie%2C%20Wyoming">Fort Washakie, Wyoming</a>, where Greeves set up a studio on the <a href="Wind%20River%20Indian%20Reservation">Wind River Indian Reservation</a>. Jeri had their two daughters <a href="Teri%20Greeves">Teri</a> (born 1970) and <a href="Keri%20Ataumbi">Keri</a> (born 1971), who would both become noted Native American artists.

Career.
In 1965, Greeves established a gallery and trading post for American Indian arts and crafts. She also began collecting Native American traditional apparel. Though it was unusual for an American Indian woman to operate a business at that time, Greeves had wanted to find ways to help Native artists promote their work since she was a child. Many of the works she carried featured the <a href="beadwork">beadwork</a> of the nearby <a href="Arapaho">Arapaho</a> and <a href="Shoshone">Shoshone</a> artists, but she carried a wide variety of arts and crafts made by diverse indigenous Americans. She began giving fashion shows to showcase various examples of tribal dress. She operated the trading post until her divorce in 1988 and then relocated to <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>.

Greeves volunteered at the Indigenous Language Institute and worked at both the <a href="Institute%20of%20American%20Indian%20Arts">Institute of American Indian Arts</a> and the <a href="Wheelwright%20Museum%20of%20the%20American%20Indian">Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian</a>, as a docent. In 1990, Greeves legally changed her name to Jeri Ah-be-hill and began working at Arrowsmith's Gallery, providing year-round fashion exhibitions. Ah-be-hill did not see herself as an artist, but rather someone who had gained knowledge from buying for many years and who could educate others about Native American traditional garments. In 1991, she was elected to the board of directors for the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA) and began directing the fashion show and contest for the <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Indian%20Market">Santa Fe Indian Market</a>. Ah-be-hill was quick to point out the differences in Native fashions from more mainstream clothing. They were not "<a href="costumes">costumes</a>", which she equated to <a href="dress-up">dress-up</a> games, but rather traditional clothing and often handmade of which styles associated with particular tribes rarely changed. Over the years that she directed the fashion contest, she saw an increase in contemporary design, which was judged in a separate category. After seventeen years of directing the popular style show at the Santa Fe Indian Market, Ah-be-hill stepped aside as chair in 2008, but continued to serve as an event advisor.

When she was not involved with the Indian Market, Ah-be-hill traveled widely presenting educational talks on Native fashions both throughout the United States and internationally. She also curated events such as the <a href="Smithsonian%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Smithsonian Museum of Natural History</a> traveling exhibit on <a href="Silver%20Horn">Silver Horn</a>, which toured the country in 1995 and included pieces from her collection of her great-uncle, Silver Horn's work. In 2010, she served as as a Native representative for the Caen Festival of <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, France. In 2011, she was the recipient of the Povi’ka Award of the Santa Fe Indian Market in recognition of her leadership and support to Native American artists and communities.

Death and legacy.
Ah-be-hill died on March 11, 2015 in Santa Fe. Between 2014 and 2016, an exhibit held honoring Native American women artists, featured part of the collection of Jeri Ah-be-hill, and works by Margarete Bagshaw, and <a href="Josephine%20Myers-Wapp">Josephine Myers-Wapp</a> and were displayed at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Indian%20Arts%20and%20Culture">Museum of Indian Arts and Culture</a> (MIAC) in Santa Fe. The three were honored in 2016 by the MIAC for <a href="Women%27s%20History%20Month">Women's History Month</a>.

The 1879 series like <a href="Ord%C3%B3%C3%B1ez%20guns">Ordóñez guns</a> of the same period were <a href="Glossary%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech loading</a>, <a href="black%20powder">black powder</a>, <a href="Built-up%20gun">built up guns</a>, with steel A tube and <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> reinforcing <a href="hoop%20gun">hoops</a>. The 1883 series was a step forward in that they were breech loading, built up guns, with <a href="Forging">forged steel</a> A tube and forged steel reinforcing hoops. The Hontoria 1883 series ranged in size from to and were 35 calibers in length. They were produced by the <a href="Arsenal%20de%20la%20Carraca">Arsenal de la Carraca</a> in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cadiz</a> and the Royal Ordnance Works at Trubia in <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a>.

The Collectors.
In the 1960s, the love for engineering and history led one person - Rui Aguilar - to start collecting optics related devices. Initially without a defined purpose of creating a museum, the collection kept growing progressively until nowadays. In 2014, the idea for the creation of the Madeira Optics Museum sparked from a conversation between Rui Aguilar and its son, Sergio Aguilar, who since then is working alongside its father in the creation and organization of the museum.
Currently, Rui and Sérgio Aguilar work together in the selection, acquisition cataloguing and preparation of every accession and on the organization of the physical area of the museum.

The Collection.
About 2000 objects are on permanent display at the museum. The categories with bigger relevance are:

Phagdru Kagyu

The <a href="Phagdru%20Kagyu">Phagmo Drupa Kagyu</a> () or <a href="Phagdru%20Kagyu">Phagdru Kagyu</a> (ཕག་གྲུ་བཀའ་བརྒྱུད) is a subschool of the Tibetan <a href="Kagyu">Kagyu</a> school. 

History.
It was founded by <a href="Phagmo%20Drupa%20Dorje%20Gyalpo">Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo</a> (, 1110–1170) who was the elder brother of the famous Nyingma lama <a href="Ka%20Dampa%20Deshek">Ka Dampa Deshek</a> (1122–1192) founder of <a href="Katok%20Monastery">Katok Monastery</a>. Before meeting <a href="Gampopa">Gampopa</a>, Dorje Gyalpo studied with <a href="Sachen%20Kunga%20Nyingpo">Sachen Kunga Nyingpo</a> "(sa chen kun dga' snying po)" (1092–1158) from whom he received <a href="lamdre">lamdre</a> transmission.

In 1158 Dorje Gyalpo built a reed-hut hermitage at Phakmo Drupa (""Sow's Ferry Crossing"") in a juniper forest in Nedong () high above the <a href="Brahmaputra%20River">Brahmaputra River</a>. Later, as his fame spread and disciples gathered, this site developed into the major monastic seat of Dentsa Thel (). Following his death the monastery declined and his disciple <a href="Jigten%20Sumg%C3%B6n">Jigten Sumgön</a> sent Chenga Drakpa Jungne () (1175–1255), a member of the Lang () family, to become abbot and look after the monastery.

<a href="Tai%20Situ%20Changchub%20Gyaltsen">Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen</a> (1302–1364) was born into this Lang family. In 1322, he was appointed by the Sakyapas as the Pagmodru Myriarch of Nedong and given the title "Tai Situ" in the name of the Yuan emperor. Soon he fought with a neighboring myriarchy trying to recover land lost in earlier times. This quarrel displeased the Sakya ruler ("<a href="dpon-chen">dpon-chen</a>") Gyelwa Zangpo () who dismissed him as myriach. Following a split between Gyelwa Zangpo and his minister Nangchen Wangtsön (), the former restored Changchup Gyeltsen to his position in 1352. Taking advantage of the situation, Changchup Gyeltsen immediately went on the offensive and soon controlled the whole of the central <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>an province of Ü. Gyelwa Zangpo and Changchup Gyeltsen were reconciled at a meeting with the Sakya lama Künpangpa (). This angered Nangchen Wangtsön, who usurped Gyelwa Zangpo as Sakya ruler and imprisoned him.

In 1351 Changchup Gyeltsen established an important Kagyu monastery at the ancient Tibetan capital of <a href="Tsetang">Tsetang</a>. This was later dismantled during the time of the <a href="7th%20Dalai%20Lama">7th Dalai Lama</a> (18th century) and replaced by a Gelugpa monastery, Gaden Chokhorling.

In 1358, Wangtson assassinated Lama Kunpangpa. Learning of this, Changchup Gyeltsen then took his forces to Sakya, imprisoned Wangtsön, and replaced four hundred court officials and the newly appointed ruling lama. The Pagmodrupa rule of Central Tibet (U, Tsang and Ngari) dates from this coup in 1358.

As ruler, Changchup Gyeltsen was keen to revive the glories of the <a href="Tibetan%20Empire">Tibetan Empire</a> of <a href="Songts%C3%A4n%20Gampo">Songtsän Gampo</a> and assert Tibetan independence from the <a href="Yuan%20dynasty">Yuan dynasty</a> of the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a> and from <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming China</a>. He took the Tibetan title "Desi" (sde-srid), re-organized the thirteen myriarchies of the Yuan Shakya rulers into numerous districts (), abolished Mongol law in favour of the old Tibetan legal code, and Mongol court dress in favour of traditional Tibetan dress.

Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen died in 1364 and was succeeded as by his nephew <a href="Jamyang%20Shakya%20Gyaltsen">Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen</a> () (1340–1373), who was also a monk. The subsequent rule of the <a href="Phagmodrupa%20Dynasty">Phagmodrupa Dynasty</a> lasted until 1435 followed by the <a href="Rinpungpa">Rinpungpa</a> kings who ruled for four generations from 1435–1565 and the three <a href="Tsangpa">Tsangpa</a> kings 1566-1641.

In 1406 the ruling Phagmodrupa prince, <a href="Gongma%20Drakpa%20Gyaltsen">Drakpa Gyaltsen</a>, turned down the imperial invitation to him to visit China.

From 1435 to 1481 the power of the Phagmodrupa declined and they were eclipsed by the Rinpungpa () of Tsang, who patronized the Karma Kagyu.

The Phagmo Drupa monastery of Dentsa Thel "was completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution in 1966-1978"

Uzi Peres

Uziel Shlomo Peres (<a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>: עוזיאל שלמה פרס), commonly known as Uzi Peres (1951-1992) was an Israeli director, scriptwriter and producer.

Biography.
Uzi Peres was born in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, Switzerland on 21 February 1951 and raised in <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>. His father, <a href="Gershon%20Peres">Gershon Peres</a> (1925-2011, better known as Gigi) was a building contractor, and the younger brother of future <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Israel">Prime Minister</a> and <a href="President%20of%20Israel">President of Israel</a>, <a href="Shimon%20Peres">Shimon Peres</a>; his mother, Carmela Keyla Peres, was an athlete. His first cousin once removed was American movie star <a href="Lauren%20Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>.

He went to <a href="Ironi%20Dalet%20High%20School">Ironi Dalet High School</a> in Tel Aviv, and then served in the <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israeli Defence Force</a> and fought in the Yom Kippur War. After being discharged, he studied Film at <a href="Tel%20Aviv%20University">Tel Aviv University</a> and the in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>.

Peres died aged 41 on 31 July 1992, when he was one of 113 people killed on the Thai Airways International Airbus that <a href="Thai%20Airways%20International%20Flight%20311">crashed</a> into a hillside whilst trying to make a bad weather landing in <a href="Kathmandu">Kathmandu</a>. He left a wife, Bracha, and three children, Sara, David and Michael. Together with the Israel Film and Television Directors Association, the Peres family established an annual prize in Uzi's name, awarded in conjunction with the <a href="Tel%20Aviv%20Cinematheque">Tel Aviv Cinematheque</a>, to the director of an outstanding short film.

A plaque dedicates to Peres at Tel Aviv Cinematheque includes a quote from one of his early films, "Pareil pas pareil" (1978), which reads: "I would like to be able to turn every moment of life into a celebration, to build memorials to everything beautiful, to all that exists ... in order to preserve and endlessly multiply all that a dream allows."

Film career.
Peres began his career with "The Wait," a short 16mm film made in Israel in 1974. He continued to work in France, making three more short 16mm works: "Choisir" (1975), "Cathédrales" (1976), which won first prize at the short film festival in <a href="Le%20Raincy">La Raincy</a>, and "Sans Draps" (1977). He also worked as an editor on <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Rossif">Frédéric Rossif</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Wild%20Nation">La Fête Sauvage</a> (The Wild Nation," 1976) and television series "L'Opéra sauvage" (1975-1981).

Returning to Israel in 1977, Peres became a founding member of <a href="Kayitz">Kayitz</a>, also known as the <a href="Young%20Israeli%20Cinema">Young Israeli Cinema</a> group, with other filmmakers including <a href="Nissim%20Dayan">Nissim Dayan</a>, <a href="Nadav%20Levitan">Nadav Levitan</a>, <a href="Rachel%20Ne%27eman">Rachel</a> and <a href="Yehuda%20Ne%27eman">Yehuda Ne'eman</a>, and <a href="Renen%20Schorr">Renen Schorr</a>. The group published a manifesto in "<a href="Kolnoa">Kolnoa</a>" magazine, insisting that they shared no single ideology or aesthetic principles, but were united by their search of an innovative Israeli film language. Responding to the government's preference to support other arts ahead of cinema, they suggested that Israeli films should be produced with small crews and low budgets, but they also lobbied for increased funding for non-commercial cinema, which led to the foundation of the Fund for the Encouragement of Original Quality Films in 1978. He only made one more short in Israel, however - 1978's "Hand Exercises," which won a Best Actor award at an Israeli short film competition.

Peres returned to France to make his first feature films: "Pareil pas pareil" (1978), "L'amour mensonge" (1979) and "Shadow of a Game" (1980). The first he directed in Israel was "First Love" (1982), produced by his sister, Ruth. Here, Yitzhak (played by <a href="Hanan%20Goldblatt">Hanah Goldblatt</a>) leaves his <a href="kibbutz">kibbutz</a> during a midlife crisis returns to his first love, Ziva (<a href="Gila%20Almagor">Gila Almagor</a>) now aged 40 with two teenage children, with inevitable complications for all involved. His final film, "Me and My Wife's Lover," was also made in Israel and produced by Ruth Peres, and released in 1983.

North Limited

North Limited was a diversified mining and resources company. Although based in Australia, its operations eventually extended to six continents. By the late 20th century the company had become the fourth largest iron ore exporter in the world with expansion underway which would have made it equal third. It's biggest asset was a majority stake in Robe River, a major miner of the <a href="Pilbara%23Iron_ore">Pilbara</a> iron ore deposits of Western Australia and the worlds lowest cost producer of <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a>.

The company was formed in 1888 as North Broken Hill Silver Mining to exploit the rich silver, lead and zinc deposits at <a href="Broken%20Hill%20ore%20deposit">Broken Hill</a> in western New South Wales, the name was shortened to North Broken Hill in 1905. Production at the original North Broken Hill mine wound down and it finally closed in 1993.

However over the years the company had diversified into other mining provinces. In 1988 they took over Peko Wallsend Ltd., changing their name to the unwieldy North Broken Hill Peko Ltd., before settling on the snappier North Limited in 1994. At Broken Hill the company had been known as 'North' to distinguish it from other miners in the area such as Broken Hill South and The <a href="Broken%20Hill%20Proprietary">Broken Hill Proprietary</a>. The nickname continued long after the company's focus had moved away from Broken Hill, so the new name just formalized what it had always been known as. 

By 2000, while North was a widely diversified resource company, iron ore assets represented 44% of its value and investing to begin production at the new West Angelas iron ore mine in the Pilbara was the company's major focus. However money had also been committed to increase production at the Iron Ore Company of Canada and the Northparkes copper and gold mine..
Takeover.
Like its peer <a href="WMC%20Resources">Western Mining</a>, North developed into a large diversified resources company with one special world class asset that attracted attention from huge mining companies across the world. In the case of Western Mining it was the <a href="Olympic%20Dam%20mine">Olympic Dam</a> copper, gold and uranium deposit, for North it was Robe River Iron.

In 2000 a bidding war for North broke out when the multinational mining giant <a href="Rio%20Tinto">Rio Tinto</a> bid $3.80 for each North share. This was topped by an <a href="Anglo%20American">Anglo American</a> bid of $4.20 Rio responded with a winning bid of $4.75 per share. The company was delisted and after the takeover, Rio Tinto integrated most of North's assets into its own operations, but sold others such as the Northparkes.

Assets.
In 2000 when it was taken over, North's major assets were:

Previously North had owned many mines and companies. Some of them were:

Swellendam Commando

Swellendam Commando was a <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> <a href="regiment">regiment</a> of the <a href="South%20African%20Army">South African Army</a>. It formed part of the <a href="South%20African%20Infantry%20Corps">South African Army Infantry Formation</a> as well as the South African Territorial Reserve.

History.
Origins.
Batavian era.
Swellendam Commando can trace its origins back to around 1795 with the <a href="Republic%20of%20Swellendam">Republic of Swellendam</a> and the unsafe situation for farmers on its eastern border with <a href="Xhosa">Xhosa</a> tribes. An independent republic had been declared from the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a>, declared with a National Assembly and Hermanus Steyn as president. It was a momentous event, but at the same time the British occupied the Cape and the new republic was called on to assist in battle. The republicans refused initially, but a commando of 70 soon left for the Cape. By 1806 with the Second British Occupation, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Blaauwberg">Battle of Blaauwberg</a> (6 January 1806), the Swellendam Commando again held the British off long enough for the rest of the Batavian army to retreat to safety.

Cape Colony Frontier Wars era.
The Government dreading a Khoi rising, made peace with the Xhosas. In 1801, another rebellion began where farms were abandoned en masse, and Khoi bands under Klaas Stuurman, Hans Trompetter and Boesak carried out widespread raids. The Swellendam commando under Comdt Tjaart van der Walt, who was killed in action in June 1802, achieved no permanent result.

Disbandment.
This unit, along with all other <a href="South%20African%20Commando%20System">Commando units</a> was disbanded after a decision by South African President <a href="Thabo%20Mbeki">Thabo Mbeki</a> to disband all Commando Units. The Commando system was phased out between 2003 and 2008 “because of the role it played in the apartheid era”, according to the <a href="Minister%20of%20Police%20%28South%20Africa%29">Minister of Safety and Security</a> <a href="Charles%20Nqakula">Charles Nqakula</a>.

They complain about the food, access to toys and their not so fancy clothes. Grace is particularly unhappy about having to look for a job to supplement the now meagre family income.
Secrets, betrayals, disobedient and dishonest children are just the tip of the iceberg of the Muwonge family problems. The show evokes a roller coaster of emotions from empathy and anger to laughter and tension right from episode one.

Deeper analysis on the album was given by David Bowes on <a href="Rock-A-Rolla">Rock-A-Rolla</a> issue #49”Archdimension Now is a triumph as wide as a galaxy, a starfire of light and hallucinatory visions across a backdrop as dark as the void. Split across two, hour-long compositions, there is a certain degree of effort involved in appreciating what’s on offer, but that’s the point. The massive scope allows for complete immersion, for listeners to cocoon themselves in sheer walls of drone and fractured samples, and for the pulsation and sonar synth to pierce the synapses with their sharp, unforgiving presence. This is less an album than a microcosm, a dimension mapped on plastic and transmitted through light, sound and grinning, endless otherness.”

Birpai

The Birpai were an <a href="indigenous%20Australian">indigenous Australian</a> people of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>.

Language.
Birpai was a dialect of <a href="Worimi%20language">the Gadjang language</a> of the <a href="Worimi">Worimi</a>. <a href="W.%20J.%20Enright">W. J. Enright</a> found 4 elderly speakers of Birpai at <a href="Wauchope%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wauchope</a> in 1932.

Country.
Birpai were in possession of some of <a href="Mid%20North%20Coast">Mid North Coast</a> land, from <a href="Gloucester%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Gloucester</a> eastwards to the where the <a href="Manning%20River">Manning River</a> debouches into the Pacific at <a href="Taree%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Taree</a>. They were mainly located south of the Manning, and on the <a href="Forbes%20River%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Forbes</a>, <a href="Hastings%20River">Hastings ("Dhungang")</a> and <a href="Wilson%20River%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Wilson</a> rivers.

Social organization.
The Birpai, sccording to <a href="A.%20R.%20Radcliffe-Brown">A. R. Radcliffe-Brown</a>, had no <a href="Moiety%20%28kinship%29">moieties</a>, but did divide their hordes into 4 intermarrying groups, 4 male <a href="phratry">phratries</a>:

marrying into 4 female groups:

Traditions differ as to whether the Birpai alternated between the coast and the hinterland seasonally. According to one tradition, they were divided into two distinct groups: inland women being called "Winmurra" and those of the coast "Mariket."

The Birpai also had <a href="Totem">personal totems</a>, called "mari."

Murrawin ceremony.
The Birpai practiced a form of ceremonial, "Murrawin", found also among the <a href="Dunghutti">Dunghutti</a> and <a href="Gumbaynggirr">Gumbaynggirr</a>. It was described by <a href="R.%20H.%20Mathews">R. H. Mathews</a> in 1900. Unlike other native rites, this did not require the presence of entire communities: two or three adjoining tribes would meet, choose initiated men from among each, and send them into the bush. They would select a spot several miles away, clear it, and create a 20-foot diameter circle on level ground with banked earth. There they would make <a href="bullroarer">bullroarer</a>s ("gheewarra/guarra", according to the dialect) and return to the main camp. Over the following nights, once some elders had set up another site hundreds of yards away, whirl the bullroarers, while chanting incantations, and strike <a href="Coolamon%20%28vessel%29">coolamons</a> rhythmically with a <a href="nulla%20nulla">nulla nulla</a>. Gradually, the initiated men trickle over to this "thoorapee" site until all are gathered in. At this point, a slanging match is started as each tribe hurls invectives at another, The morning after, the whole tribal assembly shifts camp, and women and the young are separated from the men, who then file off, clicking their boomerangs, as they make their way to the ceremonial ring prepared several days earlier, where they dance.

On their return, they hunt game, and harvest honey, or grub up edible roots, to bring to the women's camp in procession ("ngooraykoo binbinnie"), where they all supper together. The men then return to the thoorapee, strip bark and form torches which they set alight and, swinging their firebrands, charge into the women's camp. Three times a boy, whom the women, on seeing the torches, prepare by stripping near their fire, is charged as if he were to be captured. A guardian, in tribal terms his brother-in-law, then, on the third attempt, takes him by the arm, and the tribesmen swing him up onto his shoulders as he is carried off.

In the thoorapee camp, the novice is placed prone, and two men straddle his midriff. Two grasp his shoulders, two his legs, and a fifth his loins, and he is raised high off the ground, with the two men still astraddle, and then lowered, thrice. The 7 men then grab their genitals and ask the novice to pay attention. Each then rubs the boy's nose and mouth, and he is then placed on a bed of leaves near the campfire. Feinting forays to poke his eyes out with sticks are fended off by two men wielding nulla nullas. The attackers back off, turned their backs, and walks backwards towards the boy, bending over him and threatening to shit on him. The men armed with nulla nullas intervene to save his honour. Buried in leaves, he must then lie there all night, motionless.

When morning breaks, two women elders edge near the camp, and throw boomerangs in, which fall short, and then are joined by the other women, who bear bundles of sticks. They all move towards the men's camp, singing incantations. The boy is once more set astraddle on a man's shoulders and the men tramp to the women's site, where he is let down, while his guardian stands nearby. He is then made to stand, a foot on the each shoulder of the two men who support him, and shown to the women, who throw sticks their way. Then men swarm together and, with spears and shields, form a wall to hide him, and place him back on a man's shoulders and take him back to their camp, where he is again buried in leaves. A group of elders among the men, then return to the women's camp, and successively hand over, first clumps of grass, which the younger boys receive and hold at their chests, and then bundles of sticks, which they grasp after throwing the sheaves of grass away. The men then leave, gathered grass and place it back at their camp on the initiand, while the women pack up and shift camp several miles away. While doing so, they must sing certain songs and eat a restricted diet. The men return to their old camp, and hunt as preparations are made for the last stage, the "goorooyoonbang."

A dozen men standing astride a twenty-foot pole, three or four inches in diameter, which had been prepared earlier, raise it simultaneously between their legs to knee-height, as the boy sits downcast near the fire. The pole is pointed his way, and the lead man has another on his shoulders, grimacing as he gesticulates wildly. The pole is then placed almost flush to the boy, who must look at it, and the tunnel of legs, and feints are made to thrust it into him, while obscene remarks are made. They back off, turn the pole 90 degrees, and swaying together, hold it before the novice. The pole is dropped with a thud, raised and dropped again several times, bringing the rite to an end.

He was rudely awoken by a din of boomerangs thumping shields near his head the following morning, shown a 'stranger' who has been poised, grasping two branches, as if he were trampling on air, and then told to reveal to no one the secrets revealed. They then all return to the women's camp, save for the novice, who must approach it in slow steps, pitching his <a href="gunyah">gunyah</a> every evening closer until, finally, he can enter the men's camp.

History of contact.
The area around Taree was first settled by a naval man, William Wynter, who took up a selection of 2,560 acres there in 1831. Wynter appears to have had very amicable relations with the Birpai, something inferred by the fact that his son William, who grew up among the Birpai, was allowed to go hunting with them, and learnt their language. This is thought to bear witness to the peaceful character of the indigenous peoples themselves. Three years later cedar-cutters were establishing camps along the Manning river.

The highland areas and the Falls country around the Manning and Hastings rivers were still sufficiently wild to serve the aboriginal outlaw <a href="Jimmy%20Governor">Jimmy Governor</a> as a sanctuary at the turn of the 20th century.

Bayan (political entity)

In <a href="History%20of%20the%20Philippines%20%28900%E2%80%931521%29">early Philippine history</a>, a Bayan (sometimes simply called a "large Barangay") was a political entity which consisted of several social groups called "<a href="Barangay%20%28pre-colonial%29">Barangay (Filipino plural: "mga Barangay")</a>." The term's etymology can be traced back to the word ""bahayan"", meaning a "community", or literally "a place with many households." The majority of these early "bayan" were economically complex communities situated river deltas where rivers exit out into the ocean, and featured a compact community layout which distinguished them from inland communities, thus the name.

After the various polities of the Philippine archipelago were united into a single political entity during colonial times, the term gradually lost its original specific meaning, and took on more generic, descriptive denotations: population center ("poblacion") or capital ("cabisera"); municipality; or in the broadest sense, "country".

Among the most prominent of these Bayan entities were those in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Maynila">Maynila</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Tondo">Tondo</a>, <a href="Caboloan">Pangasinan</a>, <a href="Rajahnate%20of%20Cebu">Cebu</a>, <a href="Kedatuan%20of%20Dapitan">Bohol</a>, <a href="Rajahnate%20of%20Butuan">Butuan</a>, <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Maguindanao">Cotabato</a>, and <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Sulu">Sulu</a>.

Etymology and historiography.
Grace Odal-Devora traces the etymology of the term "Bayan" to the word ""bahayan"," meaning a "community", or literally "a place with many households ("bahay")." She notes that its root word, ""Ba-y"" or ""Ba-i"", is linguistically related to other Philippine words for shoreline and perimeter (both ""baybay""), woman (""babai"" or the Visayan term ""ba-i"" meaning great lady), friend (the Visayan term ""bay""), and writing ("baybayin"). She also notes that these terms are the basis for many place-names in the Philippines, such as <a href="Bay%2C%20Laguna">Bay, Laguna</a> and <a href="Laguna%20de%20Bay">Laguna de Bay</a>, and <a href="Baybay%2C%20Leyte">Baybay, Leyte</a>.

The earliest documentation of the term "Bayan" was done by early Spanish missionaries who came up with local language dictionaries to facilitate the conversion of the peoples of the Philippine archipelago to Roman Catholicism. Among the most significant of these dictionaries was the <a href="Vocabulario%20de%20la%20Lengua%20Tagala">Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala</a> by the Augustinian missionary Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura, who described it as a large town with four to ten datu lived with their followers, called dulohan or barangay.

Model of rulership.
Although popular portrayals and early nationalist historical texts sometimes depict Philippine paramount rulers as having broad sovereign powers and holding vast territories, critical historiographers such as Jocano, Scott, and Junker explain that historical sources clearly show paramount leaders exercised only a limited degree of influence, which did not include claims over the barangays and territories of less-senior datus.

For example, <a href="F.%20Landa%20Jocano">F. Landa Jocano</a>, in his seminal work ""Filipino Prehistory:Rediscovering Precolonial Heritage"", notes: ""Even if different Barangays entered into alliances with one another, there was no sovereign datu over them. Each datu ruled his barangay independently. The alliances were limited to mutual protection and assistance in times of need. It did not entail permanent allegiance. The grouping was based on consensus. Whoever was chosen by the groups as their leader exercised leadership and asserted authority over them. It was a living democracy...Barangay alliances were loosely defined. These were often based on kinship and marriage. Each Barangay remained independent and enjoyed freedom from external control. That was why Lapulapu resisted the atttempt of Magellan to make him acknowledge the lordship of Humabon. The same was true of the other datus who resisted coercive efforts of the Spaniards to make them subservient to other Datus.""

Keifer compares this situation to similarly-structured African polities where ""component units of the political structure consist of functionally and structurally equivalent segments integrated only loosely by a centralized authority dependent on the consensual delegation of power "upwards" (sic) through the system."" Junker, expounding further on Keifer's work, notes: "..."While political leadership followed an explicitly symbolized heirarchy of rank <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> this leadership heirarchy did "not" (sic) constitute an institutionalized chain of command from center to periphery. Political allegiance was given only to the leader immediately above an individual with whom a kin group had personal ties of economic reciprocity and loyalty.""

This explanation of the limited powers of a paramount leader in cultures throughout the Philippine archipelago explains the confusion experienced by Martin de Goiti during the first Spanish forays into Bulacan and Pampanga in late 1571. Until that point, Spanish chroniclers continued to use the terms "king" and "kingdom" to describe the polities of Tondo and Maynila, but Goiti was surprised when Lakandula explained there was "no single king over these lands", and that the leadership of Tondo and Maynila over the Kapampangan polities did not include either territorial claim or absolute command. Antonio de Morga, in his work "Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas", expounds:""There were no kings or lords throughout these islands who ruled over them as in the manner of our kingdoms and provinces; but in every island, and in each province of it, many chiefs were recognized by the natives themselves. Some were more powerful than others, and each one had his followers and subjects, by districts and families; and these obeyed and respected the chief. Some chiefs had friendship and communication with others, and at times wars and quarrels. These principalities and lordships were inherited in the male line and by succession of father and son and their descendants. If these were lacking, then their brothers and collateral relatives succeeded... When any of these chiefs was more courageous than others in war and upon other occasions, such a one enjoyed more followers and men; and the others were under his leadership, even if they were chiefs. These latter retained to themselves the lordship and particular government of their own following, which is called barangay among them. They had datos and other special leaders [mandadores] who attended to the interests of the barangay." "

Titles of rulers.
Because the peoples of the Philippine archipelago had different languages, the highest ranking political authorities in the largest historical Bayan polities went by different titles. In Muslim polities such as Sulu and Cotabato, the Paramount ruler was called a <a href="Sultan%23Southeast%20and%20East%20Asia">Sultan</a>. In Tagalog communities, the equivalent title was that of <a href="Lakan">Lakan</a>. In communities which historically had strong political or trade connections with Indianized polities in Indonesia and Malaysia, the Paramount Ruler was called a <a href="Raja%23Usage%20outside%20India">Rajah</a>. Among the <a href="Subanon%20people">Subanon people</a> of the <a href="Zamboanga%20Peninsula%20%28geographical%20region%29">Zamboanga Peninsula</a>, a settlement's Datus answer to a Thimuay, and some Thimuays are sometimes additionally referred to as "Thimuay Labi," or as Sulotan in more Islamized Subanon communities. In some other portions of the Visayas and Mindanao, there was no separate name for the most senior ruler, so the Paramount ruler was simply called a <a href="Datu">Datu</a>, although one Datu was identifiable as the most senior.

Scholarship.
Because of the difficulty of accessing and accurately interpreting the various available sources, relatively few integrative studies of pre-colonial <a href="social%20structure">social structure</a>s have been done - most studies focus on the specific context of a single settlement or ethnic group. There are only a handful of historiographers and anthropologists who have done integrative studies to examine the commonalities and differences between these <a href="Polity">polities</a>.

One of the earliest such studies was conducted by Jesuit missionary Francisco Colin, who, in the middle of the seventeenth century,attempted an approximate comparison of the <a href="social%20stratification">social stratification</a> in Tagalog culture with that in the Visayan culture, which would become a reference for many later scholars.

In the contemporary era of critical scholarly analysis, the more prominent such works include the studies of anthropologist <a href="F.%20Landa%20Jocano">F. Landa Jocano</a> and historian-historiographer <a href="William%20Henry%20Scott%20%28historian%29">William Henry Scott</a>. More recently, anthropologist Laura Lee Junker conducted an updated comparative review of the <a href="social%20organization">social organization</a> of early polities throughout the archipelago, alongside her study of inter and intra-regional trade among Philippine coastal polities.

Related concepts.
Feudalism.
The organization of pre-colonial Philippine states has often been described a or compared to Feudalism (see <a href="Examples%20of%20feudalism%23.22Semi-feudal.22%20.28non-Western%20European.29%20feudalism">Non-Western Feudalism</a>), particularly in light of <a href="Marxist%20analysis">Marxist socioeconomic analysis</a>. Specifically, political scientists note that political patterns of the modern <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Philippines">Republic of the Philippines</a>, supposedly a <a href="liberal%20democracy">liberal democracy</a>, can more accurately be described using the term "<a href="Cacique%20Democracy">Cacique Democracy</a>"

Cacique Democracy.
Present-day political scientists studying the Philippines have noted that the reciprocal social obligations that characterized the pre-colonial bayan and barangay system are still in place today, albeit using the external trappings of modern liberal democracy. The term "Cacique Democracy" has been used to describe the feudal political system of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> where in many parts of the country local leaders remain very strong, with almost warlord-type powers.

The term was originally coined by <a href="Benedict%20Anderson">Benedict Anderson</a> from the <a href="Ta%C3%ADno%20language">Taíno</a> word "Cacique" and its modern derivative caciquismo (sometimes translated as "Bossism"), which refers to a <a href="political%20boss">political boss</a> or leader who exercises significant power in a political system.

Mandala.
In the late 20th century, European historians who believed that historical Southeast Asian <a href="Polity">polities</a> did not conform to <a href="Chinese%20classics">classical Chinese</a> or European views of <a href="political%20geography">political geography</a> began adapting the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word "Mandala" ("circle") as a model for describing the patterns of diffuse political power distributed among <a href="Mueang">Mueang</a> or <a href="Kedatuan">Kedatuan</a> (principalities) in <a href="History%20of%20Southeast%20Asia%23Ancient%20and%20classical%20kingdoms">early Southeast Asian history</a>. They emphasized that these polities were defined by their centre rather than their boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration.

This model has been applied to the historical polities of Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia which traded extensively with various Bayan polities in the Philippines. However, Southeast Asian historians such as Jocano, Scott, and Osbourne are careful to note that the Philippines and Vietnam were outside of <a href="greater%20India">the geographical scope of direct Indian influence</a>, and that the Philippines instead received an indirect Indian cultural influence through their relations with the Majapahit empire. Philippine historiographers thus do not apply the term "Mandala" to describe early Philippine polities because doing so overemphasizes the scale of Indian influence on Philippine culture, obscuring the indigenous <a href="Austronesian">Austronesian</a> cultural connections to the peoples of <a href="Micronesia">Micronesia</a>, <a href="Melanesia">Melanesia</a>, and <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>.

Antoine Francisque

Antoine Francisque (c.1570 in <a href="Saint-Quentin%2C%20Aisne">Saint-Quentin</a> – 1605 in Paris) was a 16th-century French <a href="lutenist">lutenist</a> and composer.

Biography.
Francisque was born in Saint-Quentin circa 1570. On 23 February 1596, he married in <a href="Cambrai">Cambrai</a>, with Marguerite Behour [Bonhour], daughter of a merchant tavernier, without this act mentioning any profession.

He moved to Paris shortly afterwards, publishing his "Trésor d'Orphée" in 1600; He was also quoted on 28 September 1601 under the name Anthoine François and as a "lute player in Paris" in an act of mutual donation with his wife. They had no children at that time and lived in rue Sainte-Geneviève, <a href="Saint-%C3%89tienne-du-Mont">Saint-Étienne-du-Mont</a> parish, vis-à-vis the <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20Navarre">Collège de Navarre</a>.

He died in Paris 5 octobre 1605. He lived <a href="rue%20de%20la%20Huchette">rue de la Huchette</a> and was buried in the <a href="%C3%89glise%20Saint-S%C3%A9verin">Église Saint-Séverin</a> parish.

Works.
In 1600, Francisque published a unique collection of lute pieces:

The volume is dedicated to <a href="Henri%2C%20Prince%20of%20Cond%C3%A9%20%281588%E2%80%931646%29">Henri II de Bourbon-Condé</a> (who was only 12 in 1600), with a rather developed preface, rich with several allusions to antiquity; This dedication suggests that this nobleman was the pupil of the luthist. The volume contains 71 pieces, including a transcript of the "Susanne un jour" by <a href="Roland%20de%20Lassus">Roland de Lassus</a>, and a <a href="gaillarde">gaillarde</a> made on a <a href="lavolta">lavolta</a> by Perrichon. These are purely instrumental pieces: preludes and fantasies, pasmais and pavanes, gaillardes, <a href="branle">branle</a>s (simple, double, from Poitou, and Montirandé) and <a href="gavotte">gavotte</a>s, a prelude followed by lavoltas, ballet, and finally a "Cassandre". There is no mention of court ballets of the time.

Hence: 

Francisque is not named in any other tablature. Some pieces of the "Trésor" are in an anonymous form in the Elias Mertel ("Hortus musicali novus", Strasbourg, 1615) and <a href="Alessandro%20Piccinini">Alessandro Piccinini</a> ("Intavolatura di liuto", Bologna, 1639) collections.

Eleonore von Grothaus

Eleonore von Grothaus, also Eleonore von Münster (10 April 1734 – 26 March 1794) was a German noblewoman, a writer and poetess, and a lay musician. She may have assembled a collection of writings and music, the <a href="Ledenburg%20Collection">Ledenburg Collection</a> from the manor house where she was born. The collection held music by notable 18th-century composers that seemed lost until it was rediscovered in 2015.

Life.
Born in <a href="Schloss%20Ledenburg">Schloss Ledenburg</a>, <a href="Lower%20Saxony">Lower Saxony</a>, Eleonore Elisabeth Helene Sophie von Grothaus was the eldest daughter of the general , who served <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Brunswick-Lüneburg</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>, and his wife Anna Friederike , who inherited considerable properties. She grew up in the manor house. She wrote poems, and was interested in art and the sciences. Walter Schwarze, who published her biography in 1928, wrote: "Among the rhetorical arts ... music took the first place, and much handwritten music for piano, viola d'amour, flute and voice was in her repertoire, which was crowned by Handel and Telemann. The newest arias could be heard, and Eleonore wrote many a poem in this format or following existing melodies, and she expressed the impact of the music when she narrated how Orpheus sang ..."

In 1759, she married Georg zu (1721–1773), Hofmarschall of the <a href="Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück</a>. He was a widower with seven children. The couple had six more children, including a son, Count <a href="Ernst%20zu%20M%C3%BCnster">Ernst Friedrich Herbert zu Münster</a>-Ledenburg, Freiherr von Grothaus. After her husband died in 1773, she devoted her time mostly to raising the children. In 1783, she was appointed by <a href="Charles%20William%20Ferdinand%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a> to educate his daughter <a href="Caroline%20of%20Brunswick">Caroline</a>, then age 14, the future wife of <a href="George%20IV">George IV</a>. It was a difficult task, as she noted in her diaries. She returned to Osnabrück in 1791 for a short time, and moved then to <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a> where she died. She is buried on the .

Work.
Von Grothaus wrote around sixty poems, three stories and three stage works. She exchanged letters, for example with <a href="Justus%20M%C3%B6ser">Justus Möser</a>. She left two booklets with prose stories, two with diary entries from 1789 to 1790, and some poetry and prose in French. She published several of her literary works under her married name, Eleonore von Münster.

She may have been the collector of music, especially for the viola da gamba, which belonged to Schloss Ledenburg and is now in the State Archive of Lower Saxony, where it was studied from 2015, called the <a href="Ledenburg%20Collection">Ledenburg Collection</a>, and mostly published by <a href="Edition%20G%C3%BCntersberg">Edition Güntersberg</a>.

Warn-U

Warn-U (stylized WARN-U) is the debut <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> of <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> musician <a href="Fatima%20Al%20Qadiri">Fatima Al Qadiri</a>, released in September 2011 by the label <a href="Tri%20Angle%20%28record%20label%29">Tri Angle</a>. It was a part of her project Ayshay, which intended to reinterpret <a href="Islamic%20music">Islamic worship music</a>. The EP only consists of Qadiri's <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> vocals that are processed and altered to create other types of electronic sounds. The EP consists of thee original tracks and a "megamix" of all of them by production duo Nguzunguzu.

Composition.
Music of the Ayshay project is <a href="Fatima%20Al%20Qadiri">Fatima Al Qadiri</a>'s reinterpretation of <a href="Islamic%20music">Islamic worship music</a>, and the name Ayshay is “whatever” in Arabic. "Warn-U" is a <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a> touching on genres such as <a href="krautrock">krautrock</a>, <a href="proto-techno">proto-techno</a>, and <a href="hypnagogic%20pop">hypnagogic pop</a> and only consisting of Qadiri's own <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> vocals, which are pitch-shifted, time-stretched and layered on top of each other. "Warn-U" garnered comparisons by critics to <a href="Bj%C3%B6rk">Björk</a>'s album "<a href="Med%C3%BAlla">Medúlla</a>" (2004) as well as the works of <a href="Julianna%20Barwick">Julianna Barwick</a>.

The official press release from Qadiri's website states that the voices execute a "dizzying array of mixed, sometimes indefinable emotions," sounding "menacing and yet strangely comforting" and "ancient and bizarrely futuristic." Even Qadiri admitted she didn't know how to feel when she listened to "Warn-U", "and in many regards I hope I never can." Paul Lester of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" analyzed the vocals are altered to the point of sounding like electronic instruments rather than human voices. The EP closes with <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> production duo Nguzunguzu's twelve-minute "megamix," or "remix suite," of all the record's original tracks. The remix adds tribal <a href="Roland%20808">Roland 808</a>-style drums to the songs and what "The Monitors" described as "richer samples and effects."

Release and promotion.
On 28 February 2011, a music video for "Warn-U"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s title track was released and depicts was Dave Segal of "<a href="The%20Stranger%20%28newspaper%29">The Stranger</a>" described as "feathery gothic dread, strange architecture, kinetic geometric shapes, mystique-laden figures, fisheye lens shots of an elevator, and, most importantly, luscious lips." On 25 July 2011, Nguzunguzu's remix of the EP's title song was released. An MP3 download for the title track was released on 25 August 2011, and the EP was finally issued on compact disc, digital format, and vinyl on 26 September 2011.

Critical reception.
Lester wrote in a piece for "The Guardian", "We should WARN-U: this music will reverberate in your brain and resonate in your mind's eye long after it's over." A writer for "The Monitors" called it "another interesting release from the label that keeps on giving, delivering an album that any open minded electronica fan should definitely invest in. However, he opined that "the didgeridoo sounding vocal effect gets a little grating sometimes, while the free form nature of the tracks may also sound dragging at times." In a review of the EP for "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>", Colly similarly wrote that, "while at times beautiful and certainly inventive, "WARN-U" is somewhat one-note, and it can be difficult to differentiate between the three short original tracks. It's also free-form to the degree that it can sometimes be difficult to engage with." Both Colly and "The Monitors" were the most favorable towards Nguzunguzu's megamix of "Warn-U", Colly writing, "this is where "WARN-U" is most accessible and arguably most enjoyable, since the addition of structure helps bring Al Qadiri's more avant-garde leanings back toward earth."

Constructing a Story

Constructing a Story (French: "Construire un récit") by filmmaker and script doctor <a href="Yves%20Lavandier">Yves Lavandier</a> ("<a href="Writing%20Drama">Writing Drama</a>"), is a treatise on conceiving and writing stories for the cinema, the theater, television, and comic books, but also for novels, albeit to a lesser degree. The English edition, translated by story consultant Alexis Niki, was published in May 2017 by Le Clown & l’Enfant.

Content.
Upon the re-publication of the French version of "<a href="Writing%20Drama">Writing Drama</a>" in 2011, <a href="Yves%20Lavandier">Yves Lavandier</a> decided to extract the book’s most useful chapters and to create two stand-alone books: "Construire un récit" and "Evaluer un scénario" ("<a href="Analyzing%20a%20Script">Analyzing a Script</a>"). "Construire un récit" grew from 50 pages in the French version of "Writing Drama" to 170, and then to 220 for the 2016 edition.

"Constructing a Story" is a practical handbook on how to write a narrative. Yves Lavandier’s ambition is to help authors who want to tell a story convey their thoughts and their universe in an accessible way. For this he proposes a method that starts from the meaning the author wants to communicate to arrive at the complete narrative via the steps of the pitch, the foundations, the milestones, the step outline, and the treatment. The general principle of Lavandier’s approach is: ""You don’t build a house starting with the wallpaper.""

As in "<a href="Writing%20Drama">Writing Drama</a>", the author puts forth a vision of the "<a href="three-act%20structure">three-act structure</a>" that differs to that of many Anglo-Saxon theorists and that he considers ""simple, logical, and more importantly, natural: before the action, during the action, after the action.""

In addition to several passages covering the work of characterization, a large chapter is dedicated entirely to the character arc, the potential for psychological transformation for one of the characters. The author proposes tools to justify such a transformation and analyzes some twenty works from the specific angle of the character arc. Among these are: "<a href="The%20Apartment">The Apartment</a>", "<a href="Casablanca">Casablanca</a>", "<a href="A%20Christmas%20Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>", "<a href="Groundhog%20Day">Groundhog Day</a>", "<a href="The%20Lives%20of%20Others">The Lives of Others</a>", "<a href="Oedipus%20Rex">Oedipus Rex</a>", "<a href="One%20Flew%20Over%20the%20Cuckoo%E2%80%99s%20Nest">One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</a>", "<a href="One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">One Thousand and One Nights</a>", "<a href="Schindler%E2%80%99s%20List">Schindler’s List</a>", "<a href="The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a>", and "<a href="Toy%20Story">Toy Story</a>". In his analysis of the beginning of "<a href="Tootsie">Tootsie</a>", for example, <a href="Yves%20Lavandier">Yves Lavandier</a> points out that contrary to many other analyses, the protagonist (Dustin Hoffman) isn’t actually characterized as a chauvinist who needs to learn to respect women.

Front cover.
The cover photo represents romanesco broccoli, a natural example of fractal structure. <a href="Yves%20Lavandier">Yves Lavandier</a> considers the objective-obstacle pairing to be the basic pattern of story, and to follow the fractal principle. In Lavandier’s view, narrative is the combination, at different scales, of thousands of objective-obstacle pairings and of their resulting mechanisms: the protagonist, the inciting incident, the three-act structure, the climax, etc. The author uses "<a href="Once%20Upon%20a%20Time%20in%20the%20West">Once Upon a Time in the West</a>" to illustrate his point.

Reception.
In the magazine L’Avant-Scène Cinéma issue 609 (January 2014), Jean-Philippe Guérand writes : ""Constructing a Story is a veritable guide of writing know-how in which the author prods his reader and pushes the emerging screenwriter to give his best with sections such as "Be ferocious to your protagonist" or "Make the audience participate," and is applicable to both cinema and television."

Screenwriter and game designer Antoine Bauza states: ""While it can’t replace the reading of the sacrosanct tome "<a href="Writing%20Drama">Writing Drama</a>", Constructing a Story is a gold mine in its own right (and an excellent complement) for writers. It gave me precious advice as well as a solid dose of motivation.""

For film agent Julian Friedmann, "Constructing a Story" manages to get underneath the skin of the story.

""The chapter on creating story and character arcs is unique"", writes screenwriter and novelist Ann Kimbrough, ""I’ve never seen anyone break down arcs in this manner. I found it very useful as a writer of any medium. It’s a MUST READ part of the book.""

For screenwriter, teacher and script consultant Elana Golden, ""Constructing a Story is also a meditation on the creative process in general and cinema in particular, with examples from European and American films and from psychology, philosophy, classic theater and archetypal stories.""

When this issue was settled, the church building was reconstructed. In 1998, the church was visited by Archbishop of Rostov diocese Panteleimon.

In 2003, the construction of an annexe to the old church building began. Up to 2007 its decoration continued: altar and walls of the church were painted with canonical images in the Old Russian style. Then second floor was constructed and now it is occupied vy reception room, abbot's office, classroom for <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> (40 seats), library with a reading room, <a href="refectory">refectory</a> and utility rooms.

Reception.
The "<a href="Down%20Beat">Down Beat</a>" review by Carlo Wolff states "The sonics are interesting in a workshop way, but few of the 11 tunes are memorable for much more than process. While that can be intellectually stimulating, one eventually craves a melodic statement rather than a musical 'trialogue'."

Gaecheon Light Railway

The Gaecheon Light Railway (<a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a>: 개천 경변철도, "Gaecheon Gyeongbyeon Cheoldo"; <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>: 价川軽便鉄道, "Kaisen Keibentetsudō") was a privately owned <a href="railway">railway</a> company in <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Korea">Japanese-occupied</a> <a href="Korea">Korea</a>.

On 13 May 1916 the Mitsui Mining Railway (미츠이 광산 전용 철도, "Mich'ŭi Kwangsan Chŏn'yong Ch'ŏldo"; 三井鉱山専用鉄道, "Mitsui Kōzan Sen'yō Tetsudō") opened its first railway line, a <a href="narrow-gauge">narrow-gauge</a> line from <a href="Kaechon%20Station">Gaecheon</a> to <a href="Sinanju%20Chongnyon%20Station">Sinanju</a>, where it connected with the <a href="Chosen%20Government%20Railway">Chosen Government Railway</a>'s ("Sentetsu") <a href="Gyeongseong">Gyeongseong</a>−<a href="Sinuiju">Sinuiju</a> mainline, the <a href="Pyongui%20Line%23History">Gyeongui Line</a>. The Mitsui Railway subsequently extended its line with a section from Gaecheon to <a href="Chondong%20Station">Jeondong</a>, which was opened on 1 December 1918. In 1927 the company was reformed, becoming the Gaecheon Light Railway.

Sentetsu leased the new extension on 1 November 1932, in order to incorporate it into the <a href="Sunchon%20Station">Suncheon</a>−<a href="Manpo%20Chongnyon%20Station">Manpo</a> <a href="Manpo%20Line">Manpo Line</a> then under construction; Sentetsu opened the first section, from Suncheon to Jeondong, on that same day. Sentetsu immediately began converting the Gaecheon–Jeondong section to standard gauge, completing this work on 15 July 1933, and incorporating it into the Manpo Line, whose second section from Gaecheon to <a href="Kujang%20Chongnyon%20Station">Gujang</a> was completed three months later, on 15 October 1933.

On 1 September 1933, Sentetsu bought the Gaecheon Light Railway out outright, and the remainder of the line was absorbed officially into the Sentetsu system; the Sinanju−Gaecheon section, named the <a href="Kaechon%20Line">Gaecheon Line</a>, however, remained a narrow-gauge line; it was only after the <a href="partition%20of%20Korea">partition of Korea</a> and the subsequent nationalisation of the railways in <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> that it was converted to standard gauge; the <a href="Korean%20State%20Railway">Korean State Railway</a> began the regauging work in March 1949, completing it in eight months.

On 1 September 1933 the entirety of the line was officially absorbed into Sentetsu, with the Kaech'ŏn–Ch'ŏndong section becoming part of the <a href="Manpo%20Line">Manp'o Line</a>. After the <a href="partition%20of%20Korea">partition of Korea</a> the line was located in <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> and became part of the Korean State Railway, which converted the remaining narrow-gauge section (Sinanju–Kaech'ŏn) to standard gauge in 1949; the regauging work began in March 1949 and was completed in eight months.

Central Organising Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist)

Central Organising Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) (abbreviated COC, CPI(ML)) was a <a href="communist%20party">communist party</a> in <a href="India">India</a>, one of the main splinter faction of the original <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29">Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)</a>. COC, CPI(ML) occupied an middle position between the pro-<a href="Charu%20Majumdar">Charu Majumdar</a> group led by Mahadev Mukherjee and the anti-Majumdar group led by <a href="Satyanarayan%20Singh">Satyanarayan Singh</a>. Failing to articulate a common ideological position, COC, CPI(ML) soon suffered internal divisions and splits. Two of the splinter-groups of COC, CPI(ML) in <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> are predecessors of the present-day <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Maoist%29">Communist Party of India (Maoist)</a>.

Split between Mukherjee and Sharma, emergence of COC, CPI(ML).
The emergence of COC, CPI(ML) began in 1973 as the erstwhile secretary of the Punjab branch and <a href="Central%20Committee">Central Committee</a> member of the original CPI(ML), Jagjit Singh Sohal ("Sharma"), began to distance himself from the line of the late CPI(ML) general secretary <a href="Charu%20Majumdar">Charu Majumdar</a>. Sharma had emerged as the secretary of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist%29%20%28Mahadev%20Mukherjee%29">pro-Majumdar faction of CPI(ML)</a> but soon developed differences with the other main leader of the faction, Mahadev Mukherjee. Sharma began to distance himself from Majumdar's line of annihiliation of class enemies and the original CPI(ML) slogan 'China's chairman is our Chairman'. Mukherjee declared Sharma expelled from the party. In October 1973 Sharma formed a new Central Committee consisting of himself, Suniti Ghosh, Sham Chopra and Ram Nath. The Sharma-led group consistuted COC, CPI(ML) as a separate party in February 1974, after having established contacts with a number of state committees. COC, CPI(ML) gathered Sharma's group in Punjab, the Andhra Pradesh Committee, Suniti Ghosh from West Bengal and some party cadres from Uttar Pradesh. COC, CPI(ML) published an organ called "Liberation". COC, CPI(ML) sought to unite all groups that had been part of CPI(ML) by the time Majumdar had died in 1972, reaffirming that Majumdar's party was the sole true CPI(ML) (thereby rejecting Satyanaryan Singh's break-away <a href="Provisional%20Central%20Committee%2C%20Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29">CPI(ML)</a>).

In Andhra Pradesh.
The strongest group that had joined COC, CPI(ML) was the Andhra committee under the leadership of <a href="Kondapalli%20Seetharamaiah">Kondapalli Seetharamaiah</a>. As of 1974 the Andhra committee was based in <a href="Nagpur">Nagpur</a>. The Andhra committee had five active armed squads ('dalams') and a number of district-level party committees. The squads continued to carry out annahiliation actions. 

Whilst the squads of the original CPI(ML) had been virtually dismantled by January 1974, COC, CPI(ML) reorganised squad actions 1974-1976. COC, CPI(ML) squad activities were largely limited to <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a>. In <a href="Medak%20district">Medak district</a> a squad led by Kotagiri Venkati was particularly active, conducting nearly 30 robberies in 1974 and a similar number in 1975. The squad disintegrated after the killing of Venkati on June 25, 1976 in Mupparam, <a href="Warangal%20district">Warangal district</a>. 

In some parts of Andhra Pradesh COC, CPI(ML) mobilised agitations against landlords and moneylenders. COC, CPI(ML) sought to mobilise the <a href="Adivasi">Adivasi</a> population in <a href="Godavari">Godavari</a> forest, although this effort was unsuccessful as no organisation was built amongst the local population. In Dharmavaram taluq, <a href="Anantapur%20district">Anantapur district</a> COC, CPI(ML) organised peasants and seized some 1,000 acres. The Dharmavaram struggle came to an abrupt end when the leader of the movement, Sriramulu, and a number of peasants were killed by landlords. COC, CPI(ML) claimed a role in industrial strikes in Nizamabad Cement Factory, Usha Engineering and other locations. COC, CPI(ML) organised agricultural workers' strikes in <a href="Hyderabad%20district">Hyderabad district</a> (Ankusapuram area), <a href="Ongole%20district">Ongole district</a>, <a href="Nellore%20district">Nellore district</a> and <a href="Nalgonda%20district">Nalgonda district</a> (Kandakura area), all ended with limited concessions from landlords. The Andhra committee also began organising some mass organisations such as the <a href="Radical%20Students%20Union">Radical Students Union</a> and <a href="Radical%20Youth%20League">Radical Youth League</a>. 

COC, CPI(ML) managed to obtain support from intellectuals, writers and poets, organised in the <a href="Revolutionary%20Writers%20Associaton">Revolutionary Writers Associaton</a> (RWA). <a href="Sri%20Sri%20%28writer%29">Sri Sri</a> served as the RWA president. RWA members toured Andhra Pradesh and organised mass meetings, accompanied by musical teams from Jana Natya Mandali.

Other states.
Another group that joined COC, CPI(ML) was the "Mass Line" group in Kerala. In Kashmir the group of R.P. Saraf agreed to join COC, CPI(ML) but rejected the notion of a centralised party at this stage. Rather Saraf demanded that COC, CPI(ML) would solely function as a coordination body for the time being. Likewise the Uttar Pradesh committee asked that COC, CPI(ML) should be open to all Maoists. Thus COC, CPI(ML) did not agree with the suggestions from Saraf and the UP committee, and these two groups opted not to join the party.

Failed attempt at united front.
In 1975, in response to <a href="Emergency%20%28India%29">the Emergency</a> COC, CPI(ML) participated in a meeting organised by Satyanarayan Singh's CPI(ML). The Unity Committee and UCCRI(ML) also participated. The meeting issued a declaration calling for the formation of an 'anti-fascist united front'. However, the united front never materialised as COC, CPI(ML) and UCCRI(ML) denounced the declaration. Soon thereafter COC, CPI(ML) started to disintegrate.

'Road to Revolution' and splits in COC, CPI(ML).
COC, CPI(ML) suffered a protracted organisational crisis from the onset of the founding of the party. It failed to re-unite the communist revolutionary movement and formulate a common ideological line for the party. Rather, there were three separate documents issued by different groups, one by Sharma, one by Ghosh and one produced by the Andhra committee of the party. COC, CPI(ML) lacked a unifying theoretical analysis. Rather the members of the party leadership were united by rejection of the two other main lines of the Naxal movement at the time, i.e. those of Mahadev Mukherjee and Satyanarayan Singh. COC, CPI(ML) disagreed with continuation of Majumdar's line without any modifications (i.e. Mukherjee's position), but it could not digest the programme of Singh calling for economic struggles, mass organisations, united fronts, forest base areas and an outright rejection of the annihilation line.

In October 1975 the three documents were withdrawn and 'Road to Revolution' was adopted as a compromise measure. 'Road to Revolution' argued that the prinicipal contradiction in Indian context stood between feudalism and the broad masses of the people. It argued in favour of armed struggle, but stated that mass organisation struggles were also valid and that methods of struggle would be determined from local dynamics.

The 'Road to Revolution' failed to resolve the political crisis in COC, CPI(ML). The Andhra and Bihar committees of COC, CPI(ML) continued to adhere to the line of annihiliation of class enemies. Nevertheless, <a href="M.%20Appalasuri">M. Appalasuri</a>, one of three members of the Andhra committee, called for participation in <a href="Lok%20Sabha">Lok Sabha</a> elections. As of 1976 the Andhra committee broke away from COC, CPI(ML). Kondapalli Seetharamaiah would later merge his faction to create the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29%20People%27s%20War">Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) People's War</a>.

Appeal for release of prisoners.
After the <a href="Indian%20general%20election%2C%201977">1977 Lok Sabha election</a>, many political detainees arrested under the Emergency were released. Naxal prisoners, however, did not benefit from this move. On April 9, 1977 Suniti Ghosh of COC, CPI(ML), Satyanaranyan Singh of CC, CPI(ML), Khokan Majumder of <a href="Unity%20Committee%2C%20CPI%28ML%29">Unity Committee, CPI(ML)</a> and Apurba Roy of <a href="UCCRI%28ML%29">UCCRI(ML)</a> signed a memorandum to Prime Minister <a href="Morarji%20Desai">Morarji Desai</a>, calling for the unconditional release of 12 000 revolutionary prisoners and restoration of civil liberties. During the anti-Emergency struggle, the Janata Party had promised to release political prisoners. Once in power however, they had back-tracked on that promise.

Further disintegration.
In 1977 a faction led by Ram Nath, gathering the majorities in the Delhi, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh committees of COC, CPI(ML), broke away and formed the <a href="Communist%20League%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29">Communist League of India (Marxist-Leninist)</a>. Suniti Ghosh broke away from COC, CPI(ML) and continued to run a small faction also named COC, CPI(ML).

The secretary of the Punjab committee of COC, CPI(ML), Sham Chopra, broke away and joined the <a href="T.%20Nagi%20Reddy">T. Nagi Reddy</a> group. In 1979 what remained of Sharma's COC, CPI(ML) suffered yet another split, as some party leaders in Punjab rejected his support for <a href="Deng%20Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a> in China and the <a href="Three%20Worlds%20Theory">Three Worlds Theory</a>.

In 1982 M. Appalasuri's COC, CPI(ML) faction merged with Bhowani Roy Chowdhury's <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a>-based CPI(ML) Unity Organisation, forming the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist-Leninist%29%20Party%20Unity">Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Party Unity</a>.

A new system was introduced in the 2014 season. Now the eight teams played two legs. There were overall 14 rounds which were split into 3 stages. Each win in regular time was calculated as three points, a win in <a href="overtime">overtime</a> or after a series of <a href="penalty">penalties</a> two points, a loss in the overtime or after a series of penalties one point. The four best teams qualified for the quarterfinals, the so-called Superfinal, which was played in the <a href="single-elimination%20tournament">play-off system</a>. In the semifinals and the final there were two wins to be made in each round. The third-place game was played as a single-elimination round. The teams who reached the two worst places were pulled out from this tournament in the next year, and they were to be replaced by the winners of the Russian Cup, the second-highest ranked national tournament.

In the 2015 season, a new system of point calculation was introduced. Now, two points were given for a win in the overtime, one point after a series of penalties and zero points for any loss. Also, overall three sportsmen of a foreign club (a "legionnaire") were allowed to play in a club, two of which may play at one time in a pitch. Furthermore, each club received an opportunity to take a one-minute <a href="time%20out">time out</a> once during a game.

In the 2017 season, overall nine clubs participated, six of which qualified for the Superfinal. The two best teams of the regular season automatically entered the semifinal, while the remaining four teams played in the quarterfinals.

Sangamitra (aka) Sangamitra is an Tamil, Indian epic historical fiction movie written and directed by Sundar C. The movie cast includes Jayam Ravi and Arya in the lead roles.

The movie story set in the 8th century AD, Sangamithra, is a heartfelt tale of the trials and tribulations of Sangamithra and her journey to save her kingdom, where Jayam Ravi and Arya will play as two warriors.

The movie is produced by Sri Thenandal Films. Oscar winner AR Rahman is composing music for this movie, while Sabhu Siril takes care of art direction.

Shruti Haasan

The filmmakers had zeroed in on Shruti for the title role in Sangamithra after considering several other actors. In an unexpected development, the producers of Sangamithra announced that that actor Shruti Haasan is no longer a part of the project. “Due to unavoidable circumstances, we are unable to proceed working with Shruti Haasan in Sangamithra,” Sri Thenandal Films posted on its official Social handle.

Alderia modesta is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="sea%20slug">sea slug</a>, a <a href="marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> <a href="gastropod">gastropod</a> <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a> in the family <a href="Limapontiidae">Limapontiidae</a>. It is found in estuarine habitats and saltmarshes on either side of the North Atlantic and the North Pacific Oceans.

Description.
"A. modesta" grows to a length of about when fully expanded. The foot is broader than the body, and the sides and upper surface, apart for the front third, are covered with <a href="cerata">cerata</a> (finger-like outgrowths). In young individuals these are organised in up to seven rows, but in adults, the rows are no longer apparent. The anus is set on a papilla on the upper surface near the rear. The integument is translucent, and the branching gut and digestive gland can be seen through the cerata and the surface of the foot. The cerata are involved in respiration and pulsate regularly; this helps move the blood around the body, there being no heart in this genus. The general colour of this sea slug is pale fawn, blotched with brown, green and white.

Distribution and habitat.
"A. modesta" occurs on either side of the North Atlantic; in Western Europe its range extends from Norway to France and in North America, from <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> to <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York State</a>. It also occurs on the Pacific coast of North America from <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> to <a href="California">California</a> and in northeastern Asia where it is present in <a href="Peter%20the%20Great%20Gulf">Peter the Great Gulf</a> and the <a href="Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a>. Its habitat is tidal saltmarshes and estuaries.

Ecology.
"A. modesta" is a <a href="euryhaline">euryhaline</a> species, able to tolerate a wide range of salinities. It is nearly always associated with the yellow-green alga "<a href="Vaucheria%20litorea">Vaucheria litorea</a>" on which it feeds in saltmarshes.

"A. modesta" has poor eyesight and in order to breed, individuals probably locate each other by smell and touch. Having found a partner, they push against each other and probe each other with their oral tentacles. They then each extend their <a href="penis">penis</a>, which is armed with a sharp <a href="Stylet%20%28anatomy%29">stylet</a>, and push this through the body wall of the partner and transfer <a href="sperm">sperm</a> by hypodermic injection. The <a href="gonad">gonad</a> occupies most of the body interior, and the injection can be anywhere on the body wall. Reciprocal injections usually take place at the same time, especially in larger individuals. These sea slugs are able to transfer sperm in this way within two days of <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> when only long.

Reception.
In his review for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, Thom Jurek states " The music Zooid creates has the subtlety and lyricism of fine poetry. Given Threadgill's reputation as a musical polymath, this shouldn't be a surprise, because, as evidenced here, in his own way he is reinventing jazz from the inside out."

The "<a href="Down%20Beat">Down Beat</a>" review by Bill Meyer notes "Despite a conceptual debt to the collectivism of Ornette Coleman's harmolodics, you won't mistake this music for anyone's other than Threadgill's, even though he keeps a tight rein on his own plating."

The <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a> review by Troy Collins says "A superb follow-up to last year's return to form, "This Brings Us to, Volume 2" is a stellar effort documenting the ongoing efforts of one of today's most important improvising composers."

Manhai pillar capital

The Manhai pillar capital is the portion of a ancient <a href="capital%20%28architecture%29">capital</a> found in the city of Manhai (also spelled Mainhai), one and half miles to the east of the eastern gateway of <a href="Kausambi">Kausambi</a>, <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> in <a href="India">India</a>, and published in 1980 in ""Reh Inscription Of Menander And The Indo-greek Invastion Of The Ganga Valley"" by <a href="G.%20R.%20Sharma">G. R. Sharma</a>. The fragmentary stone-slab is displayed in the Museum of the Centre of Advanced Study, Department of Ancient History, Culture and Archaeology, <a href="University%20of%20Allahabad">University of Allahabad</a>.

Analysis.
Hellenistic style.
According to <a href="Allahabad%20University">Allahabad University</a> historian <a href="G.%20R.%20Sharma">G. R. Sharma</a>, the Manhai pillar capital displays realistic depictions of animals and architectural styles, particularly floral designs, which are characteristic of <a href="Hellenistic%20art">Hellenistic art</a>. He suggests that the capital can only have been made by a Greek artist, working for the <a href="Indo-Greek">Indo-Greek</a> ruler <a href="Menander%20I">Menander I</a>, whose campaigns brought him to central and eastern India. Shamal suggests that the Manhai pillar capital is one additional element proving the presence of the of Menander in <a href="Kausambi">Kausambi</a> circa 160 BCE.

Double-humped camel of Menander.
The motifs in the abacus incorporate numerous animal, several depictions of lions, a horse, and in particular a double-humped camel, which, Sharma says, is probably characteristic of Menander I, who is also known to have used camels on his coins.

Architecture at the perimeter.
The walls in the area where the capital was found are also said to have been the work of Greek craftsmen, due to their construction consisting of large blocks joined together with iron clamps and nails, a mode of construction unknown at the time in the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> valley. An double-tanged arrowhead of Greek design was also found in conjunction with the fortifications.

Hermann Paul Reißhaus was born in <a href="Burg%20bei%20Magdeburg">Burg</a>, a small manufacturing town a short distance to the north-east of <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a> in central northern <a href="German%20Confederation">Germany</a>. The town had been extensively settled by <a href="Huguenots">Huguenots</a> after <a href="Edict%20of%20Potsdam">1685</a> and sources describe the Reißhaus family as <a href="Dissident">"dissident" (in religious terms, non-conformist)</a>. His father was a master-tailor: he himself undertook an apprenticeship in tailoring between 1869 and 1872. From 1878 he was working as a self-employed tailor. From 1892 he was the proprietor of a ladies' and gentlemens' fashion outfitters in <a href="Erfurt">Erfurt</a>.

Politics.
In 1874 Reißhaus joined the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democratic Party (""Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands"" / SPD)</a>. By 1878 he had relocated to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. That was the year of <a href="Bismarck">Bismarck</a>'s <a href="Anti-Socialist%20Laws">Anti-Socialist Laws</a>, however, and in 1880, as a political activist, he was deprived of his Berlin residence permit. He moved to <a href="Erfurt">Erfurt</a> in December. Like many Social Democrats excluded from Berlin he was able to shape the new political party in his new home region. He became the dominating figure in the Erfurt district <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a>, a position he retained till his death in 1921.

In the context of the <a href="Anti-Socialist%20Laws">Anti-Socialist Laws</a>, the 1884 Health Insurance Law (""Krankenkassengesetz"") offered one route for progressive political work that could be undertaken legally. The Erfurt <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democrats</a> received a visit from <a href="Wilhelm%20Liebknecht">Wilhelm Liebknecht</a> in February 1882 and in July of that year there was a visit from . The purpose was to offer support and encouragement. In the <a href="German%20federal%20election%2C%201884">1884 General Election</a>, for the first time, in Erfurt the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> topped the poll with 2,662 votes in the city (through nationally they were still being outperformed by several centre and right of centre parties). Still in 1884, Reißhaus found himself banned from distributing printed material.

He produced and wrote for the Thuringia party newspaper "Tribüne" following its launch. The first issue of the "Thüringer Tribüne, the organ for everyman from the people" appeared on 1 September 1889. In it Reißhaus proclaimed that it represented a Social-Democratic agenda, embracing all the interests of the people, striving to improve the condition of the working class and promoting the introduction of a universal, equal and direct voting entitlement in respect of all parliamentary bodies.

International and national politics.
During the week 14/21 July 1889 Reißhaus was in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> where he took part in what became the <a href="International%20Workers%20Congresses%20of%20Paris%2C%201889">founding congress</a> of the <a href="Socialist%20International">Second Socialist International</a>. In October 1891, sitting alongside <a href="August%20Bebel">August Bebel</a> und <a href="Wilhelm%20Liebknecht">Wilhelm Liebknecht</a>, he opened the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> (party) congress in <a href="Erfurt">his home city</a>. The congress agreed the "<a href="Erfurt%20Program">Erfurt Program</a>" which now became the reference point for party strategy and objectives through several decades. During this period he was also a co-founder of the "German Tailoring Association" (""Deutsche Schneider- und Schneiderinnenverband""), serving between 1888 and 1892 as the union's <a href="Union%20representative">"Vertrauensmann" (chief spokesman)</a> and administrative head.

In <a href="German%20federal%20election%2C%201890">the 1890 General Election</a> the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> won more votes than any other party, although application of the infamous <a href="Prussian%20three-class%20franchise">"Three-class voting system"</a> meant that this translated into just 35 of the 397 seats in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">national parliament ("Reichstag")</a>. One of those seats was nevertheless won by Paul Reißhaus, who was thereby the first Social Democrat from Erfurt to secure election to the parliament. His election leaflets proclaimed, "Down with the Cartel! - the oppressors of the people, the food-price manipulators". From June 1893 till January 1907, and then again from January 1912 till the <a href="German%20empire">imperial political structure</a> ended in November 1918, Reißhaus sat as an <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> member of the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">imperial Reichstag</a>, representing what was identified as the <a href="Saxe-Meiningen">Saxe-Meiningen 2</a> electoral district.

During the politically confrontational decade that opened the twentieth century he continued to use the ""Thüringer Tribüne, the organ for everyman from the people" (party newspaper) to campaign on important themes. In the issue of 2 July 1911 he called for a struggle to put a complete end to the contentious (and for most purposes unfathomable) <a href="Prussian%20three-class%20franchise">"Three-class voting system" (""Dreiklassenwahlrecht"")</a> ( which had the effect of weighting the vote in elections so that the votes of higher tax payers counted for more than the votes of those who paid less in tax).

War.
As late as 30 July 1914 the Erfurt <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democrats</a> were calling, at a meeting with banners, for "War against the war". Two days later, as the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a> mobilised in support of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbia</a>, on 1 August 1914 the <a href="German%20empire">German empire</a> declared war in the <a href="Russian%20empire">Russian empire</a>. On 4 August 1914 a meeting tool place in Berlin of the (since <a href="German%20federal%20election%2C%201912">1912</a>) 110 <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">Reichstag</a> members to decide on the parliamentary party's position over the <a href="First%20World%20War">war</a>. Paul Reißhaus was one of those who believed that, war having been declared, the party should support parliamentary votes to provide "war credits" to finance the fighting. Slightly more than three months later, on 12 November 1914, a meeting of party members in Erfurt, acting under the influence of Reißhaus, backed the party's so-called "<a href="Burgfriedenspolitik">Burgfriedenspolitik</a>", which amounted to a comprehensive parliamentary truce for the duration of the war. The decision was resisted by left-wing party members from the outset and would lead, in 1917, to a <a href="Independent%20Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">split</a> of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> itself. Despite his initial public support for the leadership line, Reißhaus, like many on the political left, continued to be badly conflicted over political support for the war. On 21 December 1915, with slaughter on the frontline and acute deprivation on the home front mounting, he signed a declaration opposing the fifth vote for war credits and absented himself from the chamber before the actual vote was held.

On 25 March 1916 Reißhaus spoke out against the exclusion from the party of 18 <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> Reichstag members who had voted against war credits. The group of eighteen, known as the , went on to form the "Social Democratic Working Group" in the Reichstag, which adumbrated the <a href="Independent%20Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">wider party split</a> of 1917. Riehaus himself nevertheless stayed with the "mainstream" SPD. In January 1917 he gave a speech in Erfurt setting out his vision for the party and criticising the leadership: "The underlying cause of these splits is the overall political strategy which representatives of the party majority have been following since 4 August 1914 ... The former majority wanted to direct the party towards socialist reform. That is the clear and simple objective of the majority of representatives ... Getting rid of the capitalist social order was the defining goal of the old Social Democratic Party. Now they just want a seat at the table of government".

Postwar developments.
<a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319">Revolution</a> broke out in Erfurt on 8 November 1918. This was part of a wider revolutionary wave that had started in the <a href="Kiel%20mutiny">northern ports</a> earlier in the month. In Erfurt Reißhaus and quickly emerged as leaders of the city's <a href="Workers%27%20council">Workers' and Soldiers' Councils</a>. They called for the creation of a "German Socialist Republic", with freedom to assemble and hold street demonstrations, the lifting of censorship and the liberation of all political prisoners. In several German cities the revolutionary movements of those time clearly took inspiration from the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> which had broken out a year earlier and was still unfolding. In Erfurt the demands of the <a href="Workers%27%20council">Workers' and Soldiers' Councils</a> were seen by many in the local political establishment as relatively moderate. On 9 November 1919 , the city's venerable mayor,co-opted Reißhaus and a fellow SPD politician called Richard Friedrich to become members of the as representatives of the <a href="Workers%27%20council">Workers' and Soldiers' Councils</a>. The central part that Reißhaus had played in the formulation of the <a href="Erfurt%20Program">Erfurt Program</a> nearly thirty years earlier meant that his socialist credentials were still in good order: he carried considerable authority, and there are indications that it was as a result of his involvement and leadership that the city was spared much of the internecine violence that accompanied the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319">year of revolutions</a> in other German industrial cities.

In the aftermath of war Paul Reißhaus also made a return to national politics. In January 1919 was elected to the <a href="Weimar%20National%20Assembly">Weimar National Assembly</a>, representing the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> and Electoral District 36 (<a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>). The National Assembly was the body mandated to produce a constitution for a new post-imperial - some dared to use the adjective "republican" - <a href="Weimar%20Germany">Germany</a>. Election to the assembly took place through a far more democratic election than any that had gone before. Even women were permitted to vote, and for both sexes the minimum voting age was reduced to 20. As part of his own election campaign Reißhaus distributed a leaflet with a characteristically defiant message: "...accordingly, the National Assembly will have a composition that will hold back all capitalist and reactionary pressures. The old capitalist tyranny is defeated for good". In the event, things did not quite turn out that way.

The <a href="Weimar%20National%20Assembly">Weimar National Assembly</a> turned out to be the precursor to a new kind of <a href="Reichstag%20%28Weimar%20Republic%29">national parliament ("Reichstag")</a> for a new kind of <a href="Abdication%20of%20Wilhelm%20II">post-imperial</a> <a href="Weimar%20Germany">Germany</a>. In June 1920 Paul Reißhaus again secured election as SPD member representing Thuringia. However, he died on 21 September 1921. He was absent from the first Reichstag sitting of 24 June 1920, and there is no mention in the minutes of his having spoken in the new Reichstag. His party colleague <a href="Wilhelmine%20Eichler">Wilhelmine Eichler</a> took over his parliamentary seat. 

Personal.
Paul Reißhaus was married to Anna Schumann (1859–1945). They had two recorded children: Oswald Reißhaus (1877–1934) and Elfriede Reißhaus (1893–1944).

Tescelin le Roux

Tescelin le Roux ( – 11 April 1117), or Tescelin de Fontaine, Tescelin le Saur, Tescelin Sorus, was a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundian</a> knight, keeper of a castle on the road from <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to <a href="Dijon">Dijon</a>, and father of Saint <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a>.
His castle, which had been largely destroyed, was rebuilt in the 19th century and is now a pilgrimage destination for followers of Saint Bernard.

Family.
Tescelin le Roux was born about 1070, son of Tescelin (), a knight of the <a href="House%20of%20Ch%C3%A2tillon">lord of Châtillon</a> and Saruc de Grancey.
The sketchy available evidence indicates that Tescelin was a "miles castri", a dependent knight unrelated to his lord.
As a de Grancey, his mother may have been connected to the de la Ferte family, one of whom became the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem.
<a href="Alberic%20of%20Trois-Fontaines">Alberic of Trois-Fontaines</a> wrote in the 13th century that Tescelin's mother married Fulk, lord of Aigremont, as well as Tescelin's father.
She had a son named Gui by Fulk,

Tescelin is described as having a reddish complexion, almost yellow-haired, commonly known as Sorus, or Le Roux.
<a href="William%20of%20St-Thierry">William of St-Thierry</a> said he was "a man of large possessions, gentle in manners, a great lover of the poor, of devoted piety, and of an extreme zeal for justice ... He never took up arms except in defence of his own lands, or in company with his lord...".

In 1085 Tescelin married Aleth de Montbard ( – 31 August 1106).
Aleth, also called Alith, Elizabeth or Alix, was daughter of Bernard, lord of Montbar.
Her brother, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20de%20Montbard">André de Montbard</a>, was one of the founding members of the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>, with <a href="Hugues%20de%20Payens">Hugues de Payens</a>.
Their children were Guy, seigneur de Fontaine, Saint <a href="Gerard%20of%20Clairvaux">Gerard of Clairvaux</a>, Saint Bernard de Clairvaux (1091–1153), André, Barthélémy, Nivard, Abbé of Hautvilliers and Ombeline (1092–1141).
A chronicler of Saint Bernard says that his parents were "illustrious by their rank and high descent, but more illustrious by their virtues."

Career.
<a href="Fontaine-l%C3%A8s-Dijon">Fontaine-lès-Dijon</a> is a steep, tree-covered hill beside the highway from <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to <a href="Dijon">Dijon</a>.
Tescelin and his followers were assigned to protect this strongpoint.
A strong house was built on the hill in the 11th century, entrusted to Tescelin le Roux as seigneur de Fontaine.

Tescelin is often listed among the witnesses of ducal donations.
For example, he is found around 1100 at the time of the donation of the lands of Marcennay by <a href="Odo%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Odo I, Duke of Burgundy</a>, who was leaving for Jerusalem, in 1100 and 1101 in the second and third renewals of the donation of Marcennay, and between 1102 and 1111 during the judgment of the ducal court against <a href="Hugues%20de%20Chatillon">Hugues de Chatillon</a> concerning the forest of Marcennay.
Tescelin Sorus is among the signatories of a diploma of <a href="Hugh%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Hugh II, Duke of Burgundy</a>, in favour of the Monastery of Saint Marcellus at <a href="Chalon-sur-Sa%C3%B4ne">Chalon-sur-Saône</a>.
On 16 February 1106 Tescelin was one of the witnesses when <a href="Pope%20Paschal%20II">Pope Paschal II</a> consecrated the <a href="Church%20of%20Saint-B%C3%A9nigne%20de%20Dijon">Church of Saint-Bénigne de Dijon</a>.
He received "between his hands" the donation of the village of <a href="Pouilly%2C%20Moselle">Pouilly</a> by his cousin Milon de Montbard around 1113.
Tescelin is among the witnesses of the charter of foundation of <a href="Molesme%20Abbey">Molesme Abbey</a>.

Alèthe died in 1905 and was buried at the <a href="Abbey%20of%20St.%20Benignus">Abbey of St. Benignus</a> at Dijon.
The Abbot Jarenton had the images of her six sons engraved on her tomb.
Towards the end of his life, in 1116 Tescelin became a monk.
His death on 11 April 1117 is recorded in the register of deaths of the Church of St. Benignus at Dijon, where Alith had been buried many years earlier.

Legacy.
Saint Bernard was born in what is now the large tower of the present <a href="Couvent%20et%20Basilique%20Saint-Bernard">Couvent et Basilique Saint-Bernard</a>.
Tescelin's castle was held for three centuries by the Sombernon family, Tescelin's descendents in the female line.
During the reign of <a href="Louis%20XIII%20of%20France">Louis XIII of France</a> (1609-43) the castle was converted into a convent for the <a href="Congregation%20of%20the%20Feuillants">Congregation of the Feuillants</a>.
The convent was suppressed during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and the building used for a smithy.
The birthplace was restored and transformed from 1881 to 1897.
It has become a place of pilgrimage for followers of Saint Bernard.

Qvarqvare III Jaqeli () (died 1535) was a Georgian ruling Prince and <a href="Atabeg">Atabeg</a> of <a href="Samtskhe-Saatabago">Samtskhe-Saatabago</a> during 1518–1535. Member of the <a href="Jaqeli">Jaqeli</a> family and son of Atabeg <a href="Kaikhosro%20I%20Jaqeli">Kaikhosro I Jaqeli</a>. His failure to capture the throne at the death of his father Kaikhosro may have been caused by the ambition of his uncle <a href="Mzetchabuk%20Jaqeli">Mzetchabuki</a>, who had seized Atabeg's title from him. Despite of this Mzetchabuk Jaqeli declared Qvarqare as his successor. During his uncle's reign Qvarqvare actively involved in state affairs. In 1515 ill Mzetchabuk resigned from the throne and came to the Monastery as a monk. Qvarqvare couldn't ascend to the Meskhetian throne, because his second uncle <a href="Manuchar%20I%20Jaqeli">Manuchar I</a> had revolted. Qvarqvare went to <a href="Safavid%20empire">Safavid Persia</a>, became vassal of Shah <a href="Ismail%20I">Ismail I</a> and lived at his court in <a href="Tabriz">Tabriz</a> until his accession. In 1518 Qvarqvare commanded <a href="Qizilbash">Qizilbash</a> army and invaded <a href="Samtskhe">Samtskhe</a>. Persians dethroned <a href="Manuchar%20I%20Jaqeli">Manuchar I</a> and placed Qvarqvare on the throne.

Dionysusmosaic Dion

The Dionysusmosaic is the largest preserved mosaic found in excavations in <a href="Dion%2C%20Pieria">Dion</a>. It shows the epiphany of the triumphant <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>. In a chariot drawn by panthers, accompanied by two <a href="centaurs">centaurs</a>, he emerges from the sea, supported by a <a href="silenos">silenos</a>, with a cup of wine in his hand.

Location.
The ancient site, with significant excavations and an archaeological museum, is located just outside the modern village of Dion in the Greek region of <a href="Central%20Macedonia">Central Macedonia</a> in the coastal plain at the foot of <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a>, about 15 km from <a href="Katerini">Katerini</a> and about 17 km from the ancient <a href="Leivithra">Leivithra</a>.

Excavations.
In the summer of 1987 archaeologists found the most important <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> of the extensive excavation site (the excavations still last). Protected by the covering soil layer it is almost completely preserved.

Of course this precious find had to be protected but should also be accessible to the public. The archaeologists decided to name the place where the mosaic was unearthed "Villa of Dionysus". For over 20 years, the mosaic was sheltered from people and the sun under a roof structure. In order to be able to see the work from all sides, a footbridge was built, on which visitors could orbit it. The roof helped against the rays of the sun, but it was powerless against water and general decay. From year to year the condition became worse. Single mosaic stones (tesserae) dissolved from the ground, plants grew in the cracks. It was only a matter of time before this mosaic, which had remained largely intact for nearly two millennia, would be destroyed.

Restoration.
It was decided to create a special building for this work of art. It is located just behind the museum, west of it, and was baptized in the name of Archaeothiki. After completion of the building the mosaic had to be removed from the "Villa des Dionysos". In the fall of 2015, conservators, archaeologists and workers began this project. In order to be able to divide the mosaic into several parts, the position and shape of the individual mosaic stones were first recorded on the intended dividing lines. They were then removed. A special adhesive fabric and textile strips were applied to fix the remaining stones in their place. The mosaic was divided into several, transportable, plates. After that, these plates had to be separated from the underlying ground. At the edge, with long drills, close to each other, holes were drilled into the ground beneath the fixed object. With flat steel blades, which were cut into the holes at certain intervals, experts separated the mosaic from the ground. Then it was carefully raised to allow a suitable steel plate to be driven underneath. The Helpers covered the surface with a wooden plate. With several belt tensioners, the plates (steel plate and wooden plate) were fixed against each other so that no movement was possible during transportation. Via a ramp the parts, weighing up to 500 kg, reached a trailer and were transported to the Archaeothiki.

Meanwhile, in Archaeothiki, a precise image of the entire mosaic was spread on the ground. It was made on a scale of 1:1 to show the restorers where to place each single part. In order to stabilize the mosaic stones, in the next step, the carrier layer under the mosaic was removed and replaced by mortar. With steam, the curators dissolved the special adhesive fabric and removed the attached protective materials. In June 2017 the works had been finished.

Bengaluru–Chennai High-Speed Railway Corridor

The Bengaluru-Chennai High-Speed Corridor (or Bangalore-Madras High-Speed Railway Corridor) is a proposed 340-kilometer long <a href="high-speed%20railway%20line">high-speed railway line</a> that connects two major economic and state capitals in the southern parts of the Republic of India, <a href="Bengaluru">Bengaluru</a> and <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>.

Construction has yet to begin and the project still remains standing as a distant proposal. Several feasibility studies have been completed, notable by Germany and China, who have come to the conclusion that the costs of infrastructure improvement are too high for benefits to be obtained.

The proposal would see the journey times between the two cities reduced to around ninety minutes with upgrading work costing around 200Rs/km.

History.
The current journey from Bengaluru to Chennai run at 145 kmph and takes around seven hours to complete, with ticket prices starting from as little as rupees.

<a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> Chief Minister, Siddaramaiah, suggested that the state wanted to run <a href="Shinkansen">bullet trains</a> to Chennai, and was conducting talks with his counterparts in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> about the topic. He commented that the journey could be done in less that one hour though no studies had yet been conducted prior to those words.

A feasibility study by <a href="China">China</a> on the project was submitted to the Federal Government in June 2015. While Germany also proposed to conduct its own feasibility study at the same time. The then Railways Minister, Suresh Prabhu, suggested that the route would be one of the next high-speed railways to be implemented in India.

Japan Railway Technical Service (JARTS) and Oriental Consultants submitted a feisability study in early 2016 about constructing the high-speed railway line through a PPP with the government. In mid-2016, the government of Andhra Pradesh floated a Special Purpose Vehicle to support the creation of high-speed railways passing through the state. French state-owned company SNCF also expressed an interest in building a high-speed railway line too.

In early 2017, Indian Railways (IR) responded to a proposal by Elon Musk for a Hyperloop to connect the two cities in thirty minutes, saying that it would be unlikely due to government bureaucracy.

During the June 2017 opening of Bengaluru's Green Line, Japan’s Ambassador to India, Kenji Hiramatsu, suggested that the railway line should be built with support from Japanese development funds.

Description.
The high-speed railway line would mainly be built along side the existing railway between the two cities. However, a 38-kilometre viaduct between Bangarapet and Vaniyambadi, as well as a 44-kilometre viaduct between Katpadi and Arakkonam, would need to be constructed due to hilly terrain.

There would be two new railway stations built underground in Bengaluru, while Chennai would witness the high-speed trains, running at around 350 km/h, terminating at its existing central station.

<doc id="54934808" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54934808" title="Endre Bíró">
Endre Bíró

" Endre Bíró" (<a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="April%2022">April 22</a>, <a href="1919">1919</a> – <a href="Velem">Velem</a>, <a href="June%2013">June 13</a>, <a href="1988">1988</a>) was a Hungarian biochemist whose research findings in the biochemistry of the muscle and muscle contraction found international recognition. (His full name is Miklós Endre Bíró translated into English as Nicholas Andrew Bíró hence in his publications in English he is referred to as N. A. Bíró.)

Early Life.
Endre Bíró was born on April 19, 1919 into a liberal-minded Hungarian-Jewish family as the second son of Lipót Bíró and Emma Gráber.

Endre Bíró got an M.A. degree for teachers in physics and chemistry at the <a href="University%20of%20Szeged">Miklós Horthy University</a> of Szeged. He was awarded the University's prize for his work "The Determination of the Avogadro's Number Based on the Examination of Emulsions". He got his Ph.D. in organic chemistry and experimental physics in June 1942. 

After having finished university, Endre Bíró, taking into account the then prevailing social circumstances, did not even try to look for a job due to Hungary's anti-Jewish laws. ("By 1940 the number of Jews affected by anti-Jewish legislation in Hungary to the extent of being deprived of their livelihood was about 224,000." )

In 1942 he was drafted into labor service that was required of Jewish men during World War II, who, based on Hungary's anti-Jewish laws, were barred from serving in the Hungarian Army. Draft-aged Hungarian Jewish men were used as auxiliary troops of the Hungarian army. They were not allowed to bear arms, and towards the end of the war they were not allowed to wear military uniforms. 

In the summer of 1944 Endre Bíró defected his labor service unit in Transylvania, became a Soviet prisoner of war and before his return to Hungary he lived in Bucharest in 1944 and 1945. Endre Bíró first went to Brassó and then to Bucharest, where he received help from the JOINT.

Endre Bíró was already living in Budapest when he saw a report in one of the papers informing its readers that Albert Szent-Györgyi planned to come to Budapest to start a research institute.

In a motivation letter dated April 9, 1945 written to Albert Szent-Györgyi and preserved among Endre Bíró's papers, he writes, among others, as follows: "As indicated by the enclosed resume, even earlier the reason for my going to university was my intention to devote myself to pure scientific research. I felt I had a scholarly aptitude. However, in the previous regime, due to circumstances beyond my control, I was not able to achieve much in scientific research. I am firmly committed to my decision of dealing with pure scientific research, although I am aware that being a scientist does not mean a high salary."

Scientific Career.
Endre Bíró started his scientific career at the Biochemistry Institute of the Péter Pázmány University of Budapest in 1945, an institute that <a href="Albert%20Szent-Gy%C3%B6rgyi">Albert Szent-Györgyi</a> founded in the same year.

"It was Albert Szent-Györgyi who founded the first Hungarian school of biochemistry, the activities of which have been world famous since then. Among the researchers of the institute we can name, among others, Ilona Banga, Endre Bíró, Tamás Erdős. Mihály Gerendás, János Gergely, Ferenc Guba, Kálmán Laki and <a href="Brun%C3%B3%20Ferenc%20Straub">Brunó Ferenc Straub</a>." 

Remembering these times, one of Endre Bíró's colleagues writes as follows: "I started my career as a fresh university graduate at the Medical Chemistry Institute in 1950. Mátyas Rákosi, who was officially referred to as «best disciple of Stalin», had already instituted a reign of terror in the country, and the waves of the terror started to reach the Hungarian Academy of Sciences as well as the universities, including the Medical Chemistry Institute, at this time. Endre Bíró hardly survived the shameful times of 1944, and now he had to face another crisis. Colleagues who had a similar career benefited a great deal from the «new order» and thus became willy-nilly the tools of terror. Endre Bíró stayed aloof from this «solution». (...) Endre Bíró led an exemplary life. He respected science very much indeed, and he never treated it as a means for his career. Due to his modesty, he was pushed to the background in an unfair way... A professor heading an institute does not always have time for the junior research assistants. However, Zebi (as Enre Bíró was nicknamed for short) was always available when needed. We had a maxim: «Don't worry, Zebi will explain it!» " 

Albert Szent-Györgyi and his team, including Endre Bíró attended, the 6th International Congress of Experimental Cytology lasting from July 10 till July 17, 1947 in Stockholm. Dissatisfied with the Communist rule of Hungary, most members of the Albert Szent-Györgyi's team emigrated to the West. (Endre Bíró met Albert Szent-Györgyi the next time twenty-five years later in 1972 in America, in Cold Spring Harbor.)
Endre Bíró got a Ph.D. in biological sciences in 1955, and an advanced doctorate degree of biological sciences in 1967.

In 1950 the Communist regime changed the name of Pázmány Péter University into <a href="E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s%20Lor%C3%A1nd%20University">Eötvös Loránd University</a> and, a year later, made the medical faculty of the University into an independent medical school <a href="Semmelweis%20University">Semmelweis University</a>.

In 1953 Endre Bíró was invited to head the Animal Biochemistry Department of the Faculty of Natural Sciences of Eötvös Loránd University. However, as instructed by the Ministry of Culture, after a few years the department ended its activities, and within the Department of Genetics a small Biochemistry Research Unit was set up. In the beginnings, this research unit had only two full-time employees Endre Bíró and the recently graduated Béla Nagy. After Béla Nagy had gone to the United States, András Mühlrad became the second member of the research unit. 

Remembering these times, András Mühlrad remembers: "I have never known a researcher who was so much exempt from vanity or narrow-minded personal ambition. Endre Bíró was always ready to help his students and colleagues with good advice. His broad knowledge transcended biochemistry and included also the social sciences. His contact with people was characterized by the fact that he naively always assumed the best of all the people he came into contact with. Therefore, he hardly had any enemies. This is something rare in science where so much moral frailty can be observed even amongst the best researchers." 

"From 1962 on, the research unit employed new staff (Gabriella Kelemen, Miklós Bálint and György Hegyi). Back then this research group was poorly equipped, but this was largely offset thanks to the ingenuity of Endre Bíró. Based on his patented invention, the Hungarian Optical Works (MOM) started to produce the first Hungarian photometer, called UVIFOT, which could operate also in the ultraviolet range. 

In 1968 the Biochemistry Research Unit became independent of the Department of Genetics, and moved into spacious premises, located on the ground-floor and the basement of a university building under 3 Pushkin Street. The long-awaited event was enthusiastically celebrated by both the staff members and the students." 

In 1968 Endre Bíró became a university professor and the head of the newly established Department of Biochemistry.
In addition to extensive teaching activities, the Department of Biochemistry at the Eötvös Loránd University did research into the biochemistry of proteins and the biology of muscle contraction. The Department had internationally recognised results in the study of the structure of myosin. 

The activities of the Biochemistry Research Group and then of the Department of Biochemistry were centred on Endre Bíró's research topics. Endre Bíró published one of his most outstanding research findings together with András Szent-Györgyi jun. They pointed out that the activity of myosin Mg-ATP can be boosted with actin. Even by today's strict standards, the school of Endre Bíró had an outstanding achievement and contributed a great deal to the good reputation of Hungarian biochemistry.

Endre Bíró's interests were not limited to the natural sciences. He was a member of the circle of artists, scientists and scholars that emerged around philosopher, <a href="Lajos%20Szab%C3%B3">Lajos Szabó</a>. Lajos Szabó, an intellectual guru had some new disciples from each generation. Endre Bíró got acquainted with him through his brother, Gábor Bíró who was by seven years his senior. The circle of Lajos Szabó was by no means an organization with formalized rules. This was a company of friends and an open school with a multi-disciplinary approach. Between 1947 and 1950 Endre Bíró attended the lectures delivered by Lajos Szabó. These lecture seminars were sometimes also attended by the essayist <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Hamvas">Béla Hamvas</a> and the philosopher <a href="B%C3%A9la%20T%C3%A1bor">Béla Tábor</a>.

He translated extensive excerpts from <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s <a href="Finnegans%20Wake">Finnegans Wake</a> and wrote a detailed study on this work of fiction. Due to the Communist oppression of culture, these translations and the accompanying essay could not be published in Hungary. 

They were first published in 1964 in Yugoslavia in the Hungarian literary monthly "Híd" (Bridge). (This magazine for ethnic Hungarians living in Yugoslavia was open to the pursuits of avant-garde.) A Paris-based important literary magazine founded by Hungarian intellectuals who fled Hungary in 1956, "Magyar Műhely" (Hungarian Workshop) published the translation alongside with the essay on Finnegans Wake. This translation had a significant impact on post-modern Hungarian prose.

Ellis then spent a year taking a post-graduate teacher training course before gaining a diploma in the history of art from the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>. In 1928, Ellis returned to Regent Street Polytechnic as a teacher and continued to teach there until 1936. During this period he married his wife, <a href="Rosemary%20Ellis">Rosemary Ellis</a> (1910-1998), and the couple began working together on a number of artistic projects and commissions. Their work included posters for <a href="London%20Transport%20%28brand%29">London Transport</a>, the <a href="General%20Post%20Office">General Post Office</a> and <a href="Shell-Mex">Shell-Mex</a> plus several designs for book covers, most notably for the long-running "<a href="New%20Naturalist">New Naturalist</a>" series published by <a href="William%20Collins%2C%20Sons">Collins</a>.

During World War II, Ellis oversaw the move of the School of Art to new premises twice, first when the School's original premises were required for military use and on a second occasion when the new premises were destroyed in April 1942. Also during the war, Ellis was commissioned to record scenes in Bath for the <a href="Recording%20Britain">Recording Britain</a> project. In particular, in 1942 he was commissioned to depict examples of the decorative architectural ironwork seen on the city's buildings as the Ministry of Works were removing the iron to help the war effort. As well as simply painting examples of the decoration, Ellis intervened with the Ministry to save several important, early nineteenth century examples from being scrapped. Ellis also recorded the effects of the <a href="Bath%20Blitz">Bath Blitz</a> bombing raids on the city and the <a href="War%20Artists%27%20Advisory%20Committee">War Artists' Advisory Committee</a> purchased examples of these pieces and also his depiction of the <a href="VE-Day">VE-Day</a> celebrations in the city.

After the war, Ellis and his wife continued with their artistic collaborations and he continued, until 1972, as head of the Bath School of Art. In this role, by developing a pioneering art syllabus and recruiting highly skilled artists as teachers, Ellis had a lasting influence on many artists.

Howard B. Meek

Early life and education.
Meek was born in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20Massachusetts">Chelsea, Massachusetts</a>, on October 30, 1893, the son of Warren Lee Meek and Eliza Fowler (Reed) Meek. His father worked in the manufacturing industry. He attended the Chelsea public schools while growing up and graduated from <a href="Chelsea%20High%20School%20%28Massachusetts%29">Chelsea High School</a>. 

Meek obtained his B.S. in mathematics from <a href="Boston%20University">Boston University</a> in 1917.

Career.
Meek created the first collegiate education in the field of hotel administration at <a href="Boston%20University">Boston University</a> in 1918. This prompted the American Hotel Association to suggest to <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> that he give instructions along these lines in a program that they would sponsor. The new course at first was a department in the College of Home Economics that Meek taught for a few years. At the age of 29, Meek founded the <a href="Cornell%20University%20School%20of%20Hotel%20Administration">Cornell University School of Hotel Administration</a> in 1922, becoming its first professor and <a href="Dean%20%28education%29">dean</a>.The first class had four courses that Meek taught 21 students. He was known as the "father of the Cornell Hotel School." It was the first college level school established for the training of hotel managers.

The school grew to an alumni of three thousand that respected Meek as a hotel professor. This interested America’s foremost hotel man of the 1920s <a href="Ellsworth%20M.%20Statler">Ellsworth M. Statler</a>. He gave $10 million to finance Cornell's Statler Hall, a complex for the professional training of future hotel managers. Meek held the position of the Dean of Cornell University School of Hotel Administration for 39 years until he retired in 1961. At that time it was an independent college with a staff of over three dozen lecturers. Toward the end of his teaching career he established a research department at the Cornell Hotel School to serve the hotel industry. He was also influential in establishing a publications department there which prints training manuals, textbooks and magazines. Other countries worldwide have adopted Meek's courses. Of the school's five hundred full-time students, about 15 percent come from outside the United States.

Societies and professional affiliations.
Meek held various positions in societies associated with the hotel industry. He was an honorary life member of the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, the National Restaurant Association, the New York State Hotel Association and the Club Managers Association of America. He was also a consultant member for various associations and companies including the New York State Minimum Wage Board for the Hotel Industry, the American Statistical Association, the Ithaca Reconstruction Home Association, the American Economics Association, Cornell Society of Hotelmen, Ye Hosts, Point IV, AID Programs, and the Tompkins County Hospital.

Honors and awards.
Meek was known as the leading educator in the hospitality industry. In 1969 he received two honors for his 50 years of service to the industry: the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University library, the first and largest library collection of hotel and food service reference material, was named the Howard B. Meek Library, and the Howard B. Meek Visiting Professorship was established at <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> by the Cornell Society of hotel men.

Personal life.
Meek married Lois Ann Farmer of <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> in 1924. She was a lecturer at the College of Home Economics and taught food management in hotel administration for several years after they were married. They had two children, Lois Jean Meek and Donald Bagnall Meek. Meek went by the nickname "Don" to those that knew him. Meek died on July 16, 1969, in Pocasset, Massachusetts. His wife died in February 1973.

G. I. Lieftinck

Gerard Isaäc Lieftinck (3 August 1902 – 9 May 1994), known in print as G.I. Lieftinck, was a Dutch academic specialising in medieval European manuscripts.

Personal life.
The eldest of two boys and three girls, Lieftinck was born in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> in 1902 to Gerard Lieftinck (1875–1957), an entrepreneur and director of the tobacco brokerage J.H. Lieftinck & Son, and his wife Elisabeth Esser (1878–1963). He married twice, had two sons, and died in <a href="Deventer">Deventer</a> in 1994.

Education and career.
From 1920 to 1925 Lieftinck studied medicine at the <a href="University%20of%20Amsterdam">University of Amsterdam</a>. Thereafter he switched to Dutch literature which remained his focus until he completed his studies in 1931; his first article, about fifteenth century Dutch mystic Hendrik Mande, appeared shortly thereafter. In 1936 Lieftinck successfully defended his doctoral dissertation on the Middle Dutch <a href="Johannes%20Tauler">Tauler</a> manuscripts. 

After commencing his career as a volunteer at the library of the <a href="Erasmus%20University%20Rotterdam">School of Economics in Rotterdam</a>, Lieftinck worked at the <a href="University%20of%20Amsterdam">University of Amsterdam</a>, at <a href="National%20Library%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Koninklijke Bibliotheek</a>, and at <a href="Leiden%20University">Leiden University</a>, becoming <a href="Curator">Keeper</a> of Manuscripts at the latter institution in 1942.

Lieftinck’s inaugural lecture at Leiden, Paleografie en Handschriftenkunde (Amsterdam, 1963), outlined “how palaeography, once considered ‘ancilla philologiae’, ha[d] become an autonomous science, and how it ha[d] moved … towards codicology of the medieval book”. He held the position until his retirement in 1972, whereupon he was succeeded by <a href="J.%20P.%20Gumbert">J. P. Gumbert</a>. Lieftinck participated in the founding of the prestigious <a href="http%3A//www.palaeographia.org/cipl/cipl.htm"></a>, Comité International de Paléographie Latine, and played an important role in the design and implementation of the Catalog of Dated and Datable Manuscripts, a centrally important resource for codicologists.

He published dozens of articles and books in Dutch, French, and English on topics in manuscript studies and palaeography. The <a href="Free%20University%20of%20Brussels">Free University of Brussels</a>, where he occasionally lectured from 1965 through 1971, awarded him an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> in 1959.

Neukieritzsch station

Neukieritzsch station is a station on the <a href="Leipzig%E2%80%93Hof%20railway">Leipzig–Hof</a> and the <a href="Neukieritzsch%E2%80%93Chemnitz%20railway">Neukieritzsch–Chemnitz railway</a>s, which branches here, in <a href="Neukieritzsch">Neukieritzsch</a> in the German state of <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>. The <a href="Neukieritzsch%E2%80%93Pegau%20railway">Neukieritzsch–Pegau railway</a>, which has now been dismantled, also branched off here from 1909 until 1999.

Location.
The station is located at line-kilometre 21.128 of the Leipzig–Hof railway. It is the starting point of another main line to <a href="Chemnitz%20Hauptbahnhof">Chemnitz</a> and the station is located on this line at line-kilometre 0.323. In addition another line branched off in Neukieritzsch to <a href="Pegau">Pegau</a> from 1909 to 1999 and the station was located at line-kilometre 0.0. 

It is located about 200 metres east of the centre of Neukieritzsch, bordering <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%20176">federal road 176</a> "(Bornaer Straße)" and "Bahnhofstraße" (station street). 

The neighbouring stations on the Leipzig-Hof railway are <a href="B%C3%B6hlen">Böhlen</a> Werke and <a href="Deutzen">Deutzen</a>. Both are about four kilometres away. On the Chemnitz line the next stop is <a href="Lobst%C3%A4dt">Lobstädt</a>, which is three and a half kilometres away. The next stop on the dismantled route to Pegau was the halt of Droßdorf, which was about three and a half kilometres away.

History.
Construction of the <a href="Leipzig%E2%80%93Hof%20railway">Leipzig–Hof railway</a> commenced at the beginning of the 1840s. The line between <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> and <a href="Altenburg">Altenburg</a> was completed in 1842. On 19 September of the same year, a halt ("Haltepunkt") was opened in the middle of undeveloped land. This served both passenger and freight transport. The halt was needed to resupply locomotives with water and coal. On the day of its opening, the first train arrived at 9:00 am. This consisted of 25 carriages and carried 500 people. A crowd of people greeted the train at the station, which had been decorated for the occasion. There was no settlement at the station, but a state road passed next to it. It began in Leipzig and ran through <a href="Zwenkau">Zwenkau</a> and <a href="Borna%2C%20Leipzig">Borna</a> to Altenburg. This road was renovated during the construction of the railway and its route was also changed. Coming from Zwenkau, it crossed the line at a right angle in the area of the station. Thus, it was possible to transfer freight from rail to road.

A settlement developed around the station. First of all, a coal shed, a goods shed, a water loading point and a workshop were built. An inn was built in 1842. A brickyard, construction companies and the first residential buildings were added. 

Although located in the vicinity of Pürsten, the station was named after Kieritzsch, which was two kilometres to the northwest. After the formation of the municipality of <a href="Neukieritzsch">Neukieritzsch</a> in November 1935, the station was renamed after it on 4 October 1936.
The <a href="Neukieritzsch%E2%80%93Chemnitz%20railway">line to Borna</a> was opened on 14 January 1867. An entrance building with a station restaurant was built. Different dates have been given for the construction of the building, including 1863 and 1885. According to an article in the <a href="Leipziger%20Volkszeitung">Leipziger Volkszeitung</a>, its opening date is unknown. A passenger tunnel and a bridge over the railway were built in 1907 or 1910. The freight yard went into operation in 1907. Another line was added in 1909 with the commissioning of the <a href="Neukieritzsch%E2%80%93Pegau%20railway">line to Pegau</a>. Thus Neukieritzsch developed into a railway node. This line was dismantled in 1949, but it was reconstructed in 1957. During the electrification of the Leipzig–Hof line, which took place in 1962, the bridge was replaced by a new structure. Another bridge was built in 1971 because the bridge built in 1962 was closed to allow the construction of a road. The pedestrian tunnel was extended in 1973. The bridge built in 1962 was demolished in 1994. There have been no freight operations at Neukieritz station since 31 December 1994. The line to Pegau was dismantled in 1997.

Since 15 December 2013 Neukieritzsch has been operated as part of the <a href="S-Bahn%20Mitteldeutschland">S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland</a>, at first served by lines S4 (Hoyerswerda–Leipzig–Geithain) and S5 (Leipzig/Halle Airport–Leipzig–Zwickau), and since December 2015 by lines S3 (Halle-Trotha–Leipzig–Geithain) and S5 (Halle–Leipzig–Zwickau). Several local bus routes serve the station and link it with the centre of Neukieritzsch as well as with <a href="Pegau">Pegau</a>, <a href="Borna%2C%20Leipzig">Borna</a> and <a href="Geithain">Geithain</a>.

Facilities.
Platforms and tracks.
Currently, the station has four platforms. There is one island platform, one "house" platform (next to the entrance building) and an external platform. All platforms have a useable length of 135 metres with a height of 38 cm above the top edge of the rail.

It is planned to renovate the platforms from 2020 to 2023. The construction of three lifts is also planned to make the station barrier-free. Soundproof walls will also be built.

On track plans from about 1960 until 1990 there were always more than 20 tracks and two loading roads.

Signal boxes.
Over time the following signal boxes have been in operation. Pink rows indicate that the signal box is closed.
Between 2020 and 2023, all four signal boxes are to be taken out of service, demolished and replaced by an <a href="electronic%20interlocking">electronic interlocking</a>.

Sidings.
The Breunsdorf lignite works received a railway connection in 1905. In 1930, the company ceased operations. Two sidings, "Familie Lanzendorf" and "Baggermontageplatz", can be seen on track plans that were dated between the 1960s and 1980s.

Other facilities.
The following buildings still exist (year of construction in brackets):

There was also a "Bahnmeisterei" (track maintenance supervisor’s office), which was demolished in 1974.

Cameron Lake Celtic Caper

The Cameron Lake Celtic is a legend passed down from some of the earlier settlers on the Bruce Peninsula, Ontario at Cameron Lake. It is said that the Cameron Lake Celtic was the Captain of a steamer that was lost to the rocks of the tip of the Bruce Peninsula in the 1800s. After losing his ship and crew to the torturous waters of the area, The Celtic ended up on the shores of small inland Lake (Cameron) with only his bagpipes. It is said The Celtic was the only survivor since he was able to use his bagpipes as a flotation device. Injured and alone The Celtic would drone his pipes across the Lake at dusk to summon help. Sadly a few short weeks later The Celtic eventually died here. Accounts of bagpipe music droning across Cameron Lake at dusk are still reported today.

<doc id="54935641" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54935641" title="Rule against foreign revenue enforcement">
Rule against foreign revenue enforcement

The rule against foreign revenue enforcement, often abbreviated to the revenue rule, is a general legal principle that the courts of one country will not enforce the tax laws of another country. The rule is part of the <a href="conflict%20of%20laws">conflict of laws</a> rules developed at common law, and forms part of the <a href="act%20of%20state%20doctrine">act of state doctrine</a>.

In "State of Colorado v. Harbeck" 133 N.E. 357, 360 (N.Y. 1921) the court referred to :
The rule has been repeatedly applied in the United Kingdom, the USA, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Singapore and other countries. It has also been codified into statute in various countries.

History of the rule.
The earliest reported case on the rule is believed to be "Attorney General v Lutwydge" (1729) Bumb 280, 145 ER 674. In that case the English courts refused to enforce a bond for Scottish tobacco duties. In 1775 <a href="William%20Murray%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Mansfield">Lord Mansfield CJ</a> famously pronounced in "<a href="Holman%20v%20Johnson">Holman v Johnson</a>" (1775) 1 Cowp 341 at 343, 98 ER 1120 at 1121 that "no country ever takes notice of the revenue laws of another." In 1779 he repeated that position in "Planche v Fletcher" (1779) 1 Douglas 251, 99 ER 164.

English law.
Although the rule had been referred to an applied in a number of English cases from as early as 1729, the rule itself was not considered beyond doubt in England until the decision of the <a href="Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> in "<a href="Government%20of%20India%20v%20Taylor">Government of India v Taylor</a>" [1955] AC 491. In that case the House of Lords unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal (who had in turn unanimously upheld the trial judge) that the <a href="liquidator%20%28law%29">liquidator</a> of an English company could not pay out sums to a foreign Government because the tax claim was not justiciable in England.

The rule as it applies under <a href="English%20law">English law</a> is summarised in <a href="Dicey%20Morris%20%26amp%3B%20Collins">Dicey Morris & Collins</a> at Rule 3:
In "Re State of Norway's Application (No 2)" [1990] 1 AC 723 the Norwegian government sought the assistance from the English courts in collecting evidence in relation to a tax claim. The respondent resisted the application on the basis that it violated the revenue rule, but the House of Lords held that assisting with the collection of evidence would not violate the rule. <a href="Robert%20Goff%2C%20Baron%20Goff%20of%20Chieveley">Lord Goff</a> said "It is of importance to observe that that rule is limited to cases of direct or indirect enforcement in this country of the revenue laws of a foreign state. It is plain that the present case is not concerned with the direct enforcement of the revenue laws of the State of Norway. Is it concerned with their indirect enforcement? I do not think so."

In "QRS 1 Aps v Frandsen" [1999] 1 WLR 2169 it was held that to uphold a contractual provision between two private contracting parties for an indemnity against the payment of foreign taxes would not constitute an indirect enforcement of a foreign tax claim, and so was enforceable.

United States.
The revenue rule has been repeatedly applied by courts in the United States. The rule was first applied in the United States in 1806 in "Ludlow v. Van Rensselaer" 1 Johns. R. 94 (N.Y. 1806).

Initially the rule was also applied to claims for taxes made by other states within the USA. In "Maryland v. Turner" 132 N.Y. 173, 174 (1911) the courts of New York state refused to enforce a judgment debt relating to taxes due in Maryland. In "Colorado v. Harbeck" 133 N.E. 357, 360 (N.Y. 1921) it was held that there was a "well-settled principle of private international law which precludes one state from acting as a collector of taxes for a sister state and from enforcing its penal or revenue laws as such. The rule is universally recognized that the revenue laws of one state have no force in another." However in "Moore v. Mitchell" 30 F.2d 600, 600 (2d Cir. 1929) the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> limited the application of the rule in the interstate context.

In "Milwaukee County v. M. E. White Co." 296 U.S. 268, 268 (1935) the Supreme Court was asked to consider whether revenue laws of other states should be enforced under the <a href="Full%20Faith%20and%20Credit%20Clause">Full Faith and Credit Clause</a>. The Supreme Court declined to extend the full faith and credit provision to revenue statutes themselves, but limited its ruling to enforcement of tax judgments handed down in the courts of other states.

Canada.
The <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> has upheld and applied the revenue rule in "United States v. Harden" [1963] SCR 366.

Civil law jurisdictions.
<a href="Civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">Civil law</a> (as opposed to <a href="common%20law%20jurisdictions">common law</a>) jurisdictions will not generally entertain foreign tax claims on the basis that they are public laws, and therefore cannot be enforced outside of the state or territory. In the Swedish case of "Bulgariska Staten v Takvorian" (NJA 1954 s.268) the court held "a state cannot use a Swedish court to collect taxes or to have other contributions made to a foreign state".

Criticism.
The rule has been subjected to criticism. Professor Adrian Briggs of <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> has criticised it on the basis that it promotes the evasion of tax liabilities. Another commentator has called it "anachronistic and destructive". But other commentators have defended it, both as a matter of practice and principle.

Abrogation.
Nations can, and do, abrogate the rule on a bilateral basis by treaty. In the English courts enforced a claim for South African taxes under a bilateral treaty between the countries. 

However, whilst treaties to share information relating to taxable liabilities are common, or for relief from double taxation, treaties empowering nations to enforce each other's tax law are relatively uncommon. Brenda Mallinak records that in 2006 the USA had only five such treaties, despite having a large number of international treaties for tax information exchange.

X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) is a novel technique that exploits a <a href="coherent">coherent</a> <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a> <a href="synchrotron">synchrotron</a> beam to measure the dynamics of a sample. By recording how <a href="coherent%20speckle">coherent speckle</a> fluctuations in time, one can measure a time correlation function, and thus measure the timescale processes of interest (diffusion, relaxation, reorganization, etc.). XPCS is used to study the slow dynamics of various equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes occurring in <a href="condensed%20matter">condensed matter</a> systems. 

Advantages.
XPCS experiments have the advantage of providing us with the information of dynamical properties of materials (e.g. vitreous materials), while other experimental techniques can only provide information about the static structure of the material.This technique is based on the generation of a <a href="speckle%20pattern">speckle pattern</a> by the scattered coherent light originating from a material where some spatial inhomogeneities are present.

Monastery Agia Triada, Sparmou

The monastery Agia Triada, Sparmou (Greek Μονή Αγίας Τριάδας Σπαρμόυ, Moni Agias Triadas Sparmou) is dedicated to the Holy Trinity.

Location.
The monastery is situated in the west of <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> at a height of 990 m near the municipality of <a href="Elassona">Elassona</a>.

History.
The exact date of the foundation is not known. Records, however, prove that the monastery was inhabited since at least 1386. It is a <a href="stauropegic">stauropegic</a> monastery, subordinated directly to the <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch of Constantinople</a> (Istanbul).

The monastery's heyday began in the early 17th century, with its climax in the second half of the 18th century. The church was renovated in 1633. The oldest, very well-preserved icons come from this period. The cells of the monks were completed around 1739. The monastery became self-sufficient and had the financial resources to engage in external affairs. The most difficult years were these of the <a href="Ottoman%20Greece">Ottoman</a> reign.

The monastery was one of the liturgical schools of Orthodox Christianity as well as schools in Thessaloniki, Constantinople or Venice. Particularly educated monks not only ensured that the Greek language remained alive, but also educated the population. A library and a study room were set up, the bookbinding workshop was practiced by experienced monks from the 17th to the 19th century. Many of the manuscripts and books of that period were saved and are located in the Monastery of Panagia Olympiotissa. Some examples are exhibited in the museum.

During the Greek independence war against Ottoman rule the monastery supported the Greek fighters. Because of its location, far from the Turkish administration in Elassona, the monks could act relatively freely. They hid fighters and ammunition, cared for clothes and provisions.

From the middle of the 19th century the slow decline began, and in the second decade of the 20th century the last monks left the monastery. For about 80 years it was closed. After the introduction of the Metropolitan of Elassona, Basileios, the reconstruction began. In 2000, the first monks once again moved into the monastery.

The monastery.
A tower overlooks the high exterior walls, which are interrupted only by small, barred windows on the upper floors. In the northern part, four powerful retaining walls reinforce the statics of the outer wall, which is about one meter thick. The ground plan is a pentagon, the church (Katholikon) is the central building. The monks' cells and other rooms like the refectory are laid out arround the church. The wooden entrance door is covered with iron and is very stable.

To the inside of the monastery, the rooms of the second storey are supported by columns. Architecturally this way colonnades are formed, surrounding the church. Benches invite the visitor to rest. From the colonnades are the entrances to the museum and the small shop of the monks, as well as to the areas not accessible to the visitor of the monastery.

A small, very old well on the south side, donates holy water. In the south-west you can find the <a href="semantron">semantron</a> and the bell-tower of the monastery. By hitting the semantron with a hammer, the monks are called to prayer.

Four <a href="chapels">chapels</a> belong to the property, of which the chapel of Saint Haralambus is located on the site of the monastery. The Chapel of All Saints, the Chapel of the High Sacred Theotokus and the Chapel dedicated to John the Baptist are outside the grounds.

The church.
The church is 23 meters long, seven meters wide and the external walls are one meter thick. It is a simple, straight building, covered with natural stones and bricks. It consists of the antechamber, the church room and the altar room accessible only to the priests.

The small windows lay the paintings, the carvings, the icons in a half-dark. All the walls are painted with biblical motifs or motifs of saints. The ceiling is made of wood and is shaped into different patterns, painted in different colors. Several chandeliers with wax candles hang from the ceiling. They are decorated with porcelain bowls and ostrich eggs. The floor is made of marble with inlays.

The door to the altar room was adorned with gilded wood carvings and icons. The carvings of the iconostasis are pure craftsmanship. Some of the icons are more recent because the old originals were stolen.

The museum.
On quite a few square meters many exhibits are shown. Precious robes, the oldest icons of the monastery from the year 1633 and books, which were partly bound here. Old silver vessels used during the liturgy, precious embroidery and documents, which are witnesses of the monastery's history, are exhibited.

Literature.

St. Ignatius of Loyola College, East Timor

St. Ignatius of Loyola College, East Timor, is a coeducational, six-year secondary school opened by the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> in 2013 near the capital city of <a href="Dili">Dili</a>. 

History.
Early efforts.
<a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a> came to <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> in 1897 and built <a href="Sacred%20Heart">Sacred Heart</a> Church in <a href="Soibada">Soibada</a> and Colégio <a href="Nuno%20%C3%81lvares%20Pereira">Nuno Álvares</a>, a school for boys, when this was a <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> colony; it remains 98.6% <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>. They left in 1910 when all religious were expelled from Portuguese colonies, and were absent for some decades. Upon returning they ran two minor seminaries, St. <a href="Francis%20Xavier">Francis Xavier</a> in <a href="Dare">Dare</a> and <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20F%C3%A1tima">Our Lady of Fátima</a> in until 2000 when priests of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> Diocese of <a href="Dili">Dili</a> took these over. They also ran <a href="St.%20Joseph%27s%20High%20School">St. Joseph's High School</a> for the Diocese of Dili from 1993 until 2011, when the diocese resumed control of it. Jesuits stood by the people in their independence struggle and two Jesuits were killed in September 1999; they are seen as martyrs, Frs. Tarcisius Dewanto and Karl Albrecht.

Founding of Loyola.
After 2011 the Jesuits turned their attention to opening two of their own schools on a common campus near Kasait, not far from Dili: Colégio Santo <a href="Ignatius%20of%20Loyola">Inácio de Loiolá</a> and teacher education Instituto <a href="St.%20John%20de%20Britto">São João de Brito</a>. In 2013 Loyola opened with 86 seventh-grade students. It offers a six-year junior-senior high school program and is coeducational. Principal Fr. Plinio Martins insists on the parents' continuing responsibility to assist in their child's education. As a Jesuit school, its aim was expressed by the Jesuit <a href="Father%20general">Father general</a> in 1986, to form “the well-rounded person who is intellectually competent, open to growth, religious, loving and committed to doing justice in generosity to the people of God.” The school's motto is that of the Society of Jesus: <a href="Ad%20maiorem%20Dei%20gloriam">For the greater glory of God</a>. In light of the country's hard-fought independence struggle with <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> which succeeded in 2002, the Jesuits propose "to form critical, competent, and caring leaders, attentive to and shaped by values derived from the Ignatian tradition, the Catholic faith, and the cultural context of Timor-Leste." A video that conveys the spirit of the College is accessible online. 

Collaborative effort.
The school integrates with other Jesuit works in the new country: a mission parish with secondary school and health care program in <a href="Railaco%20Administrative%20Post">Railaco</a>, a public service Audiovisual Production House, and Jesuit Social Service Timor-Leste which fosters volunteerism, strengthens communities, and facilitates networking.

Platz der Alten Synagoge

The Platz der Alten Synagogue ("Square of the Old Synagogue)" is a square in <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg</a>, Germany. With a size of 130 square metres, it is the second largest square in the city after <a href="Minster%20Square%20%28Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau%29">Minster Square</a>. 

The square is named after the old <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>, which was destroyed during the <a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> in 1938. The synagogue had been built in 1869/1870 to the southwest of today's location of the square. Since 2016, there have been discussions to change the name to ""Platz der Zerstörten Synagoge" (Square of the Destroyed Synagogue)". In July 2017, the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> parliamentary fraction submitted a corresponding request to the city mayor, <a href="Dieter%20Salomon">Salomon</a>. In contrast to him and the majority of the city council, the Jewish community opposed the renaming.

The <a href="Theater%20Freiburg">Stadttheater</a> and the Kollegiengebäude II of the <a href="University%20of%20Freiburg">University of Freiburg</a> are located on the square. To the south on Sedanstraße is the "Platz der Universität", where the Kollegiengebäude I and the <a href="University%20Library%20Freiburg">University Library</a> are located.

From 1927 to 1939 and after 1945 until the 1980s, the entire area between Bertold Straße and Belfort Straße was named "Werthmannplatz" until the former synagogue site became "Europaplatz". The "Platz der Universität" has been so called since 2007.

During the "Rotteckring project," the square was redesigned in 2016. On the north-south axis, the street crossing to the inner city centre has been replaced by tram tracks and the previous lawn area replaced by continuous pavement. The newly designed square opened on 2 August 2017.

History.
Bastions, Ramparts and Rempartstraße.
In the 17th century, Freiburg was extended by <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Le%20Prestre%20de%20Vauban">Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban</a> to a fortress on behalf of the French King <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a>. In the area of today's square were the "<a href="Bastion">Bastion</a> Dauphin" (later Bastei St. Leopold) and a <a href="Rampart%20%28fortification%29">rampart</a>, which connected them with the Bastion de la Reyne (later Bastei Kaiserin) and her subsequent successor Kaiser-Bastei. At the last two's locations, there is now a University Mensa and Holzmarkt.

Until their departure on 29 April 1745, as a result of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20F%C3%BCssen">Treaty of Füssen</a>, the French blew up the bulk of their fortifications, but used the remaining <a href="Earthworks%20%28archaeology%29">Earthworks (archaeology)</a> as shelters. In spite of doubling the number of inhabitants during the following decades, it was not until 1845 that <a href="Freiburg%20Hauptbahnhof">Freiburg's train station</a>, which had been built outside the old part of the city, was opened. The <a href="Mannheim%E2%80%93Karlsruhe%E2%80%93Basel%20railway">railway line from Offenburg</a>, which ended there, led to a western extension of the city beyond its former fortifications. The design developed by Josephy Roesch, was approved by the Upper Rhine government on 29 March 1846, opening the way for new roads to the <a href="Wiehre">Wiehre</a> village as well as between the station and the old town.

After 1863, Ludwig Klehe, owner of the Hammerwerk Gaggenau, built a mansion on Bertholdstraße and later Rempartstraße on the site of the former Leopold Bastei, where Heinrich von Stein also live in 1869.

The "Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft", also founded in 1863, acquired the later site at Rempartstraße 15 at the end of the decade, to build a synagogue there. Since the mayor's office had planned to abolish the rampart and convert it into a road, the community undertook necessary construction measures to carry out the building of the new synagogue, such as embankments and stairs. In the autumn of 1869, the synagogue was built within a year by plans laid out by Georg Jakob Schneider, who had already designed plans for the <a href="Colombischl%C3%B6ssle%20Freiburg">Colombischlössle</a> (1859/1860), whose location was the Bastion Saint Louis.

The building to the south of the synagogue was built in 177/1778 or 1781 as a former garrison court in the place of the "Fauler Pelz" house and was converted into a breeding house at the start of the 19th century. In 1868, before the later <a href="Prisons%20in%20Germany">correctional facility</a> was completed, it became the Rampart barracks.

In keeping with the name of the barracks, "Rempartstraße" was constructed as far back as 1866 from parts of the "rampart", which was first included in address books across Freiburg from as early as 1810. However, the majority of Rempartstraße was located in the "Breisacher Tor" area, the other part of which was integrated into the new Gardenstraße. At the same time, Bertholdstraße was named after the Jesuitengasse and the former use of high schools and the university. The continuation of Rempartstraße on the opposite side of Bertholdstraße was called Rotteckstraße from 1865. From 1867, the area, like the rest of the city, was given house numbers starting from the top of the street, instead of the numbering that had previously taken place across four city districts.

Werderstraße.
Aided by the economic upturn after the <a href="Deutsche%20Reichsgr%C3%BCndung">founding of the German Reich</a> and the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871</a>, several streets were built to the west of Rempartstraße, a name still existing today. They were named after the <a href="Siege%20of%20Belfort">Siege of Belfort</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sedan">Battle of Sedan</a>, General Field Marshall <a href="Helmuth%20von%20Moltke%20the%20Elder">Helmuth von Moltke</a> and the German Kaiser <a href="William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm I</a>. Rempartstraße itself became part of Werderstraße. This street, named after the Prussian general August von Werder, was built in 1876 to link the Gartenstraße bridge (later replaced by Friedrich's Bridge and Kronen Bridge) with Berholdstraße, which replaced a wooden bridge over the <a href="Dreisam">Dreisam</a> in 1869. A memorial to the General also has been reminiscent of the former Villa Klehe since 1874. It was acquired by Wilhelm August Platenius around 1873, the first board of the <a href="Deutsche%20Bank">Deutsche Bank</a>, founded in 1870. In addition, the Werderstraße, more precisely the Alleegarten on the site of the former Bastei Kaiserin, was one of the discarded potential sites for the <a href="Siegesdenkmal">Siegesdenkmal</a> unveiled in 1876, with whom, in addition to the <a href="XIV%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">XIV Corps</a>, Werder was also honoured as its leader.

From 1872 to 1874, the Oberrealschule, later known as the Rotteck-Gymnasium, was built next to the Villa Platenius and Sedanstraße in accordance with plans developed by <a href="Heinrich%20Lang">Heinrich Lang</a>.

General Union of Lancashire and Yorkshire Warp Dressers' Association

The General Union of Lancashire and Yorkshire Warp Dressers' Association was a <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> representing workers involved in preparing yarn for weaving who were based in northern England.

The origins of the union lay in the Federated Society of Warpdressers, founded in 1891. Three years later, it was reformed as the "General Union", with local unions in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, <a href="Chorley">Chorley</a>, <a href="Halifax%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Halifax</a>, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="Nelson%2C%20Lancashire">Nelson</a>, <a href="Preston">Preston</a>, <a href="Rochdale">Rochdale</a> and <a href="Skipton">Skipton</a> affiliating. Unusually for a textile union, it covered workers in a variety of materials, including cotton, wool and <a href="worsted">worsted</a>. It was also unusual in that it did not provide any support for <a href="industrial%20action">industrial action</a>, but instead saw its principal purpose as an <a href="employment%20exchange">employment exchange</a>, helping unemployed members find work in other mills. Within Yorkshire, it also recruited twisters and drawers, but those workers in Lancashire instead joined the <a href="Amalgamated%20Association%20of%20Beamers%2C%20Twisters%20and%20Drawers%20%28Hand%20and%20Machine%29">Amalgamated Association of Beamers, Twisters and Drawers (Hand and Machine)</a>.

On formation, the union had only 1,179 members, but this steadily increased until 1914, when it peaked at 3,362. It affiliated to the <a href="Northern%20Counties%20Textile%20Trades%20Federation">Northern Counties Textile Trades Federation</a>. It lost members when the Chorley and Preston societies disaffiliated, but these later rejoined; however, membership did not recover, and by 1949 was down to only 1,040. Faced with this decline, the Bradford and Halifax societies merged with two unaffiliated bodies: the Leeds Warpdressers and the Textile Daymen and Cloth Pattern Makers, forming the <a href="Yorkshire%20Society%20of%20Textile%20Craftsmen">Yorkshire Society of Textile Craftsmen</a>, the new organisation maintaining its affiliation.

In 1970, the union dissolved, its remaining constituents gradually merging into the Association of Preparatory Workers.

Frederick Taylor (mass murderer)

Frederick Taylor was an English colonial property manager and agricultural capitalist in the Victoria region of Australia. He is best known as the main perpetrator of the <a href="Murdering%20Gully%20massacre">Murdering Gully massacre</a> which occurred in 1839 along <a href="Mount%20Emu%20Creek">Mount Emu Creek</a> near <a href="Mount%20Noorat">Mount Noorat</a>. This massacre resulted in the deaths of about 40 men, women and children of the Tarnbeere gundidj clan of the <a href="Djargurd%20Wurrung">Djargurd Wurrung</a> people. Taylor was also involved in other shooting deaths of Aboriginal people near <a href="Geelong">Geelong</a> and <a href="Lake%20Colac">Lake Colac</a>. After moving to <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a>, he was involved in frontier conflict there with the <a href="Gunai">Gunai</a> people. Despite his responsibility for the killings being well known and well documented, Taylor was never convicted and enjoyed high esteem in British colonial society until his death in 1872.

Early years and Arrival in Australia.
Frederick Taylor was born on the 25th of December 1810 in England. He came to the <a href="Port%20Phillip">Port Phillip</a> region in Australia in March 1836 and not long after was overseer at <a href="Charles%20Swanston">Charles Swanston</a>'s <a href="Indented%20Head%2C%20Victoria">Indented Head</a> station. He seems to have had strong connections with notable British people in India such as Captain Swanston and George McKillop.

Murder of Woolmudgin.
In October 1836, a head clansman of the <a href="Wathaurung">Wathaurung</a> named Woolmudgin (or Curacoine) came to Indented Head. Taylor mistakenly identified Woolmudgin as a person wanted for an armed attack. He tied Woolmudgin to a tree and placed a shepherd named John Whitehead as sentry while he went to notify the authorities. Whitehead later shot Woolmudgin and dumped his body in the <a href="Barwon%20River">Barwon River</a>. Whitehead was arrested and Taylor was placed on a ₤50 bond as a witness. At the subsequent trial, Taylor failed to appear and Whitehead was acquitted. Captain William Lonsdale wrote that he thought Taylor "entertained a strong suspicion that he had given strong encouragement to the prisoner [Whitehead] to commit the murder". Taylor then avoided any further legal scrutiny by fleeing to <a href="Van%20Diemen%27s%20Land">Van Diemen's Land</a>.

Lake Colac shooting.
Frederick Taylor returned to the mainland in 1839 and appears to have briefly been a licensed squatter in the <a href="Port%20Fairy">Port Fairy</a> region. There is a record of Taylor in association with another man named Arthur Lloyd shooting an aboriginal man dead at Lake Colac in 1839.

Murdering Gully Massacre.
Also in 1839, Taylor was appointed manager of George McKillop's and James Smith's "Strathdownie" station. In that year, having heard of an encampment of Tarnbeere gundidj and other people at a place called Puuroyuup within the station, Taylor went out to remove and punish them. While the aboriginals were asleep, Taylor with the aid of a number of shepherds and workers on horseback, formed a cordon around them and then fired at them indiscriminately. Somewhere between 35 and 40 men, women and children were killed. The bodies were thrown into waterholes, but were later removed and burnt due to survivors bringing attention to the scene by endeavouring to recover the corpses of their relatives from the waterholes.

Some of the survivors included Larkikok, Woreguimoni, Karn, Benadug and Bareetch Chuurneen. Many of these people went to the nearby Buntingdale Wesleyan mission to seek refuge and report the crime. With interest from authorities mounting, Taylor again fled the colony, this time absconding onto an American whaling vessel that was moored in <a href="Portland%20Bay">Portland Bay</a> and sailing to India. Taylor was tried "in absentia" by Crown Prosecutor James Croke and although Taylor's role was of a "very suspicious nature" he was acquitted due to evidence from Aboriginal people being inadmissible.

The massacre occurred on Taylor's Creek which was named after Frederick Taylor. It is notable that due to the killings, the creek was renamed <a href="Mount%20Emu%20Creek">Mount Emu Creek</a> and the station itself was given a new title in 1840 of "Glenormiston" by its new owner Niel Black.

South Asia.
Taylor spent the next few years in India and Ceylon, consolidating with contacts in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> with a view to return to Australia and set up new squatting interests. These people were Richard Sterling Jones, John Davison Smith, John Michael Loughnan and Henry Nicholas Loughnan. The Loughnans became particularly close to Taylor. J.M. Loughnan was a Captain in the 10th Bengal Cavalry, Fort Adjutant at Fort William in Calcutta and aide-de-camp to Governor General Lord Auckland. After attaining enough influence and organisation, Taylor prepared to return to Australia, choosing the newly occupied <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a> region to establish himself as a squatter.

Gippsland.
In early 1842, Taylor arrived in the <a href="Monaro%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Monaro</a> region of New South Wales with Richard Sterling Jones, William O'Dell Raymond and H.N. Loughnan with their flocks of sheep ready to overland into plains of Gippsland. Later that year they had established stations on <a href="Gunai">Gunai</a> land near modern day <a href="Bairnsdale">Bairnsdale</a> with Indian derived names such as Lindenow and Lucknow. Over the next fifteen years, Taylor was either overseer or license holder of a number of pastoral stations in that region including Deighton, Emu Vale, Swan Reach, Avon/Molly Plains and Lindenow. He was also assignee of Glencoe station. The were a number of <a href="Gippsland%20massacres">massacres of Gunai</a> people in this time period that involved groups of settlers shooting down the aboriginals, but it is not clear if Frederick Taylor was directly associated. There are three incidents though where Gunai people took revenge on shepherds employed by Taylor.

The first was in 1842, where a shepherd was killed on Taylor's Lindenow station; the second was in 1844 were two shepherds were killed on the same property; and the third was in 1847 on the Deighton holding where the aboriginals were rushing the shepherds' huts. The first two occurred when there was minimal police presence in the region and therefore it was up to the squatters to enforce control. Records of punishment given out by Taylor are absent but given his background it is unlikely that punitive missions were not organised. The third incident was marked by Sergeant McLelland of the <a href="Native%20Police">Native Police</a> being called out to the station. On his return to the Green Hills police barracks near <a href="Boisdale">Boisdale</a> he dispersed "20 blacks away".

While in Gippsland, Taylor also advocated for the importation of <a href="coolie">coolie</a> labour from India. In 1844 he endeavoured to bring some Indian coolie labourers over the <a href="Snowy%20Mountains">Snowy Mountains</a> and into Gippsland. They deserted en masse however due to Taylor treating them harshly. Taylor's reputation was again catching up with him, as the local Crown Commissioner, Captain Tyers, banned him from holding a pastoral license in 1844. However, due to pressure from his patrons in the Loughnan brothers, Taylor's ban was overturned in 1846.

From this point on, Frederick Taylor no longer received any trouble from his past. In fact, to all intents and purposes, he became a successful and respected colonist. He became rich trading cattle and other livestock products out of <a href="Port%20Albert">Port Albert</a>, wrote letters petitioning the Superintendent and advised other squatters on sheep washing innovations.

Castlemaine.
By the mid 1850s, Taylor gradually removed his interests from Gippsland to the <a href="Mount%20Alexander">Mount Alexander</a> goldfields area around modern day <a href="Castlemaine%2C%20Victoria">Castlemaine</a>. Taylor's Paddock near <a href="Yapeen">Yapeen</a> is named after him. His reputation in British colonial society apparently being so clean by this stage that he actually became a magistrate at Strathloddon and appeared as an expert witness at Legislative Council enquiries into mining and port related investigations. In 1858, Taylor was able to subdivide and sell much of his property around Castlemaine to gold miners.

Elsternwick.
In 1864, Frederick Taylor finally sold out of all his pastoral interests and moved to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. He dissolved his association with the Loughnans and was paid out an astonishing amount of ₤22,361. In 1868 he bought the prestigious <a href="Alfred%20Louis%20Smith">Alfred Louis Smith</a> designed Bonally house and acreage in <a href="Elsternwick%2C%20Victoria">Elsternwick</a>. This property was five acres fronting onto <a href="Port%20Phillip">Port Phillip</a> with an exquisite ornamental garden. The house still exists as the Bonleigh residence on Bonleigh Avenue in <a href="Brighton%2C%20Victoria">Brighton</a> and was recently valued at $6.5 million.

Death and Legacy.
Taylor died on the 14th of February 1872 at the Bonally mansion. His obituary claims he was an "an old and respected colonist". Taylor's total asset worth at his demise was £23,105. He never married and did not have an heir. In his will he left Bonally to his associate H.N. Loughnan, who moved into the residence and lived there until 1877. Frederick Taylor is buried at St Kilda cemetery with an impressive headstone. For a man who was involved in the killing of scores of people and the dispossession of entire clans, repercussions were negligible but unjust rewards were many.

National Society of Dyers and Finishers

The National Society of Dyers and Finishers was a <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> representing textile <a href="dyers">dyers</a> and related workers in the United Kingdom, principally in northern England.

The union was founded in 1851 as the Huddersfield Operative Dyers' Association and Relief Society. A small, local union, by 1880 it had only about 150 members. However, it then decided to expand its remit, admitting workers in related jobs, such as finishers, millers and scourers, and admit workers in other areas of Yorkshire and Lancashire. In recognition of this, it renamed itself as the Huddersfield, Bradford, Barnsley and District Dyers, Finishers, Millers, Scourers and Kindred Trades Association. The small Lancashire Cotton Skein Dyers Association merged with it in 1890, and by 1901, its membership had grown to 1,270.

In 1902, the union decided to begin admitting women, although they were only ever a small minority of members. It renamed itself as the "National Society of Dyers and Finishers" in 1908, membership having reached nearly 4,000. It became the National Union of Dyers, Finishers and Textile Workers in 1918 and four years later merged with the <a href="General%20Union%20of%20Textile%20Workers">General Union of Textile Workers</a> and the Yeadon, Guisley and District Factory Workers' Union, forming the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Textile%20Workers">National Union of Textile Workers</a>. <a href="Arthur%20Shaw%20%28trade%20unionist%29">Arthur Shaw</a>, general secretary of the Dyers and Finishers, became secretary of the new union.

Alfred (1818 ship)

Alfred was launched at Chittagong in 1818 and in 1820 her owners transferred her registry to Great Britain. She then traded around India and between Britain and India under a license from the EIC. Between 1827 and 1828 made a voyage to China for the British <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> (EIC) as an "extra ship", i.e., under charter. In 1845 she was condemned but new owners restored her and named her "Deutschland". She was last listed in 1857.

Career.
"Alfred" first appears in "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" in 1820. Her master is Wilkerson, her owner is Alexander, and her trade is London—India.

What the above table, drawn from various issues of "Lloyd's Register", hides is that between 1827 and 1828 she made a voyage to China under charter to the EIC.

Christopher Cantwell

Christopher Charles Cantwell (born 1980) is an American <a href="white%20supremacist">white supremacist</a> and <a href="white%20nationalist">white nationalist</a> political commentator and activist. Part of the broader movement called the <a href="alt-right">alt-right</a>, Cantwell attained notoriety during and immediately after his participation in the <a href="Unite%20the%20Right%20rally">Unite the Right rally</a>.

He grew up in <a href="Stony%20Brook%2C%20New%20York">Stony Brook, New York</a>, and in 2012 moved to <a href="Keene%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Keene, New Hampshire</a>.

Broadcasting and writing.
Cantwell began as a <a href="Men%27s%20rights%20movement">Men's rights activist</a> and has contributed to the <a href="A%20Voice%20for%20Men">A Voice for Men</a> website. In 2014 he wrote for <a href="CopBlock.org">CopBlock.org</a>, a police-critical organization. In the same year he was presented as one of three "Difference Makers" (for "fighting for their constitutional right to be total shitstains") on the "<a href="Colbert%20Report">Colbert Report</a>" which documented the "Free Keene Squad" harassing meter maids. He also co-hosted the <a href="anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalist</a> radio show "<a href="Free%20Talk%20Live">Free Talk Live</a>" but was suspended in May 2015, in his words, "for calling a <a href="social%20justice%20warrior">social justice warrior</a> a <a href="nigger">nigger</a> on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>" and, after a reinstatement, again and definitely in September 2015, also on accusations of racism.

Meanwhile, in December 2013, Cantwell started what he called "Some Garbage Podcast", disseminated through <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> and elsewhere, and in April 2015 renamed it "Radical Agenda" ("a show about common sense extremism"). In 2017, he deleted most of the episodes from YouTube after receiving warnings about community standards violations. He increasingly moved from libertarian anarchist to white-supremacist ideas, to the point that in 2017 he introduced a weekly "What Would <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a> Do?" segment by "Hadding," a frequent caller to the show who also runs a <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust-denying</a> site called National-Socialist Worldview.

In January 2016, Cantwell endorsed <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> for president. What he described as his "sorry excuse for a studio in Keene, New Hampshire," included a Donald Trump "God-Emperor" poster, a "<a href="Gadsden%20flag">Don't tread on me</a>" flag, a sign saying "White Lives Matter," as well as multiple guns lying on his desk.

Ideology.
Cantwell has self-identified as a member of the <a href="alt-right">alt-right</a>. The <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a> includes Cantwell in its list of people on the alt-right. The <a href="Southern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> has a profile of Cantwell, where it says that he advocates white nationalism with a libertarian spin.

Cantwell has identified as a <a href="libertarianism">libertarian</a> and used to endorse the <a href="non-aggression%20principle">non-aggression principle</a> (NAP). This is contradicted by his advocacy and endorsement of violence, but Cantwell has squared his endorsement of violence with the non-aggression principle by noting that the NAP allows for "retaliatory" violence against initial aggressors. By his own account, he was originally radicalized in 2009 after listening to a presentation by former <a href="Libertarian%20Party">Libertarian</a> presidential candidate <a href="Michael%20Badnarik">Michael Badnarik</a>.

In 2013, he was expelled from the libertarian <a href="Free%20State%20Project">Free State Project</a> for promoting violence.

Cantwell is an admirer of <a href="right-libertarianism">right-wing</a> <a href="anarcho-capitalism">anarchist</a> philosopher <a href="Hans-Hermann%20Hoppe">Hans-Hermann Hoppe</a>, who wrote: "There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and removed from society." This is the basis for Cantwell's frequent reference to "physical removal" - often made specific as "helicopter rides" in the manner of Chilean dictator <a href="Augusto%20Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a>, who had leftist opponents thrown out of helicopters over the sea.

Cantwell has also expressed admiration for <a href="Tucker%20Carlson">Tucker Carlson</a>, who, Cantwell says, "is basically telling white America to prepare for war as directly as he can get away with while remaining on <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a>. I couldn't agree with him more, and if he tells me to pick up a gun, I'm doing it." 

Participation in Unite the Right rally (and aftermath).
Cantwell participated in the Unite the Right rally held in <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville, Virginia</a> on August 11–12, 2017. He was featured by <a href="Vice%20News">Vice News</a> in a video about the rally, where he disputed a characterization of the rally as nonviolent, and said: “I'm carrying a pistol, I go to the gym all the time, I'm trying to make myself more capable of violence.”

On August 16, 2017, <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> said it had shut down Cantwell's Facebook and <a href="Instagram">Instagram</a> profiles due to statements he made in connection with the rally. On August 17, it was reported that Cantwell had been banned from online dating service <a href="OKCupid">OKCupid</a> after a woman reported receiving a message from him after watching his <a href="Vice%20News">Vice News</a> video.

A video of Cantwell choking back tears and weeping after hearing that an arrest warrant for him was out was published on August 16, 2017, and reported on by a number of news outlets.

On August 17, 2017, Cantwell wrote on his blog that he was preparing to turn himself in to the University of Virginia Police. He also said that <a href="PayPal">PayPal</a> had blocked him from withdrawing money for six months, and that he had removed it as a payment method, and that he had been completely banned from <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> and that Blubrry, the podcast service he used, had canceled his account so his podcasts were no longer available. In another blog post, he wrote that <a href="Venmo">Venmo</a>, <a href="Dwolla">Dwolla</a>, and <a href="Stripe%20%28company%29">Stripe</a> had also disabled his accounts, as had <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="MailChimp">MailChimp</a>, <a href="Match.com">Match.com</a>, and <a href="Tinder%20%28app%29">Tinder</a>. Nevertheless, on August 20 he resumed hosting the "Radical Agenda" with episode 343.

2017 Barcelona attack

A van was <a href="Vehicle-ramming%20attack">driven into pedestrians</a> on <a href="La%20Rambla%2C%20Barcelona">La Rambla</a> in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> on the afternoon of 17 August, killing 13 and injuring at least 100. Police said that two men had been arrested in connection with the La Rambla attack; another was reported as having been killed by police. In <a href="Ripoll">Ripoll</a>, a man was initially alleged to have rented the van, but he later told police his <a href="Identification%20document">ID</a> had been stolen by his brother.

The night before the Barcelona attack, an explosion occurred the <a href="Catalonia">Catalan</a> town of <a href="Alcanar">Alcanar</a> which leveled a building and killed one person. Josep Lluís Trapero, head of the <a href="Mossos%20d%27Esquadra">Mossos d'Esquadra</a>, the <a href="police">police</a> force of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, said it was related to the La Rambla attack. Nine hours after the Barcelona attack, police shot and killed five people in <a href="Cambrils">Cambrils</a> planning an additional attack.

The <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Spain">Prime Minister of Spain</a>, <a href="Mariano%20Rajoy">Mariano Rajoy</a>, called the attack in Barcelona a <a href="jihadist">jihadist</a> attack. <a href="Amaq%20News%20Agency">Amaq News Agency</a> attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> (ISIL). The attacks were the deadliest in Spain since the March <a href="2004%20Madrid%20train%20bombings">2004 Madrid train bombings</a> and the deadliest in Barcelona since the <a href="1987%20Hipercor%20bombing">1987 Hipercor bombing</a>.

Alcanar explosions.
On 16 August 2017, an explosion destroyed a house in <a href="Alcanar">Alcanar</a>. The explosion is believed to have killed two individuals, with police doing DNA testing to confirm. It also injured six other people and caused substantial damage to neighbouring houses. Police initially thought it was an accidental <a href="gas%20explosion">gas explosion</a>, but hours later believed stockpiled explosives had accidentally gone off. A Moroccan man was injured in the explosion and taken to the hospital, where he will be questioned by police. The explosive TAPT and 120 canisters of <a href="butane">butane</a> and <a href="propane">propane</a> were found inside the house. Catalan bomb squads carried out a controlled explosion at the property where the gas canisters were stored. There was speculation that the terrorists may have intended to take trucks loaded with explosives and combustible gas to attack the <a href="Sagrada%20Fam%C3%ADlia">Sagrada Família</a>.

Police said they were working under the hypothesis that the terrorists shot in Cambrils were connected to the Barcelona attack and Alcanar explosions. Police chief Josef Lluis Trapero believed terrorists were in the process of manipulating the gas canisters when they exploded, after which they decided to continue their plans by conducting more rudimentary vehicle ramming attacks. Spanish police have identified two bodies, with Spanish media speculating they may be of Abdelbaki Es Satty and Youssef Aallaa.

Second explosion.
A second explosion occurred at the same location during excavation, which may have been caused by a spark from a <a href="backhoe">backhoe</a> igniting a gas canister among the debris. At least nine people were injured, with one police officer in a critical condition.

Barcelona.
Vehicular assault on pedestrians in La Rambla.
At 16:56 <a href="Central%20European%20Summer%20Time">CEST</a> (<a href="UTC%2B2">UTC+2</a>) on 17 August, a white <a href="Fiat%20Talento">Fiat Talento</a> van was driven onto the <a href="sidewalk">pavement</a> of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>'s <a href="La%20Rambla%2C%20Barcelona">La Rambla</a>, crashing into pedestrians for about between <a href="Pla%C3%A7a%20de%20Catalunya">Plaça de Catalunya</a> and <a href="Liceu">Liceu</a> and stopping on a <a href="Joan%20Mir%C3%B3">Joan Miró</a> mosaic. Witnesses said the vehicle zigzagged at high speed down Las Ramblas, ramming pedestrians and cyclists. The driver then fled.

The first reports stated there had been two deaths and that dozens of people had been injured. The vehicle was reportedly hired in the neighbouring location of <a href="Santa%20Perp%C3%A8tua%20de%20Mogoda">Santa Perpètua de Mogoda</a>, along with a similar van, considered to be a getaway vehicle and found by 19:00 in <a href="Vic">Vic</a>.

In a police <a href="press%20conference">press conference</a> at 19:00 local time, a spokesperson confirmed the terrorist nature of the event, with one dead and 32 injured (10 seriously).

At about 20:20 local time, the Catalan government confirmed that 13 people were dead and at least 50 were injured. A suspect was in custody. Catalonia's president, <a href="Carles%20Puigdemont">Carles Puigdemont</a>, later announced another arrest.

Fatal stabbing and car theft.
After the ramming attack, a man stabbed a civilian to death and stole his car.

Ramming of police barricade on Avinguda Diagonal.
About two hours later, a white <a href="Ford%20Focus">Ford Focus</a> rammed a police barricade in <a href="Avinguda%20Diagonal">Avinguda Diagonal</a> and gunshots were exchanged, leaving an officer injured. The vehicle fled to neighbouring location <a href="Sant%20Just%20Desvern">Sant Just Desvern</a> and the driver abandoned the car near the building known as <a href="Walden%207">Walden 7</a>. The police found a man stabbed to death in the rear seat. Police believe the car was hijacked by one of the Ramblas attackers escaping the scene, and the driver murdered.

Cambrils.
Early on 18 August in <a href="Cambrils">Cambrils</a>, an <a href="Audi%20A3">Audi A3</a> automobile with five people on board was driven into a crowd of pedestrians before it overturned in the confluence of Passeig Miramar, Passeig Marítim and Rambla de Jaume I streets. Its occupants, who wore fake <a href="Explosive%20belt">suicide vests</a>, started attacking bystanders with knives; a 63 year-old woman died of stabbing injuries. 

A policewoman was also injured in the attack. A nearby policeman shot and killed four of the assailants and a fifth died of his injuries hours later. One of the assailants was filmed by bystanders being shot by police, including as he rushed towards policemen. The men were linked to the Barcelona attack according to the police. 

The final victim count in <a href="Cambrils">Cambrils</a> included one civilian killed and six others injured, including a Cuban tourist and a police officer.

Casualties.
Aside from seven attackers, 15 people of 8 different nationalities were killed: 13 on La Rambla, one stabbed in Barcelona by the attacker who stole his car, and one in Cambrils. Over 100 people from over 34 nations were injured, including 15 who were critically injured.

Suspects.
The police investigation points to a terrorist cell of twelve members. One, Younes Abouyaaqoub, who is suspected of being the driver of the Ramblas van, remains at large. Five suspected members were shot dead by police after the Cambrils attack; 4 suspects are in custody, and two others may have died in the Alcanar gas explosion. A day after the attack, the number of suspects arrested had risen to four.

Younes and Houssaine Abouyaaqoub.
Younes Abouyaaqoub was born on 1 January 1995 in <a href="M%27rirt">M'rirt</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. At the time of the attack, Abouyaaqoub was living in Ripoll, Spain. According to police sources, his identity documents were found in the second van which was intercepted by Catalan police in Vic. He is now considered the prime suspect as the driver responsible for the Ramblas attack. The manhunt centers in Girona. Abouyaaqoub's mother, speaking in a foreign language and translated into Spanish by a cousin, spoke to the press and said her son had been brainwashed by imam Abdelbaki Es Satty. Houssaine was one of the attackers killed in Cambrils.

Moussa Oukabir.
Moussa Oukabir, 18, was earlier named the prime suspect as the driver of the La Rambla vehicle. Later investigation named Younes Abouyaaqoub as the driver of the van. The van, a <a href="Fiat%20Talento">Fiat Talento</a> had been rented using the identity documents of a <a href="Ripoll">Ripoll</a> resident of Moroccan descent, who, according to the police was not personally involved in the attack. The man voluntarily turned himself in to the police station to report the theft of his documentation. He alleged that his younger brother, Moussa Oukabir, had stolen the documentation from him. 

Moussa Oukabir had an <a href="NIE%20number">NIE</a> (Numero de Identidad de Extranjero, i.e., identity number as a foreigner in Spain) since 2005. In 2014 and 2015, he played futsal for the local youth team of club de fútbol sala del Ripoll. In 2015, when asked on the social media website Kiwi what he would do in his first day as king of the world, he responded, "Kill the infidels and only spare Muslims who follow the religion."He was shot and killed by police after the Cambrils attack. His older brother remains in custody.

Said and Youssef Aallaa.
Said Aallaa, 19, was shot and killed by police after the Cambrils attack. He was Moroccan, born in <a href="Naour%2C%20Morocco">Naour</a>. "<a href="La%20Vanguardia">La Vanguardia</a>" reported that Aallaa's social media contained photographs of firearms and that his religiosity was evidenced by his membership in Islamic study groups. Aallaa had been living in Ribes de Fraser, a village near Ripoll. In 2014-105, he played futsal in the local youth team of club de fútbol sala del Ripoll 

Youssef Aalla might be one of the individuals killed in the Alcanar explosion.

Mohammed and Omar Hychami.
Mohammed Hychami was 24 years old; his brother Omar Hychami was 21. They both were onboard the Audi used to perpetrate the Cambrils attack and both shot and killed by police immediately following the Cambrils attack. Their names, place of birth (Morocco) and ages were released by the Catalonian police. The brothers' mother told the media Mohammed had said he was leaving on vacation and would return in a week; Omar, instead, left Thursday afternoon (August 17th, the day of the Ramblas attack).

Abdelbaki Es Satty.
Abdelbaki Es Satty, an imam at Ripoll, born in Morocco, is suspected by police of being one of the individuals killed in the initial explosion in Alcanar. 40 years old, he had been renting a room in the house with a man for four months. On 16 August, just before the attack, he told the man he was leaving for a trip to Morocco. In 2012, the imam left the prison in El Castellón, where he had been serving a four-year sentence because of drug trafficking. While in prison, he established a "special friendship" with , who is serving an 18-year sentence for his role in the <a href="2004%20Madrid%20train%20bombings">2004 Madrid Train Bombings</a>. Es Satty is also implicated in the 2006 "Operation Chacal", when five islamists were arrested for sending jihadis to fight in Iraq. Es Satty who had been employed as imam at the Ripoll mosque since 2015, quit "abruptly" in June. Investigators believe the imam might be aligned with the <a href="Salafist%20movement">Salafist movement</a>, but this might not be unusual, as one in three prayer centers in Catalonia also are. Es Satty is believed to have died in the initial Alcanar house explosion.

Arrests.
Three people, including the brother of Moussa Oukabir, were arrested in Ripoll. 

Mohamed Houli Chemlal, 20 (born in <a href="Melilla">Melilla</a>) who was wounded in the Alcanar explosion has also been detained. He studied at the Abat Oliba public institut public and played futsal in Escola de Futsal Ripoll.

A third man, Salh el-Karib the owner of an internet shop in Ripoll has also been arrested.

Claim of responsibility.
The ISIS-linked <a href="Amaq%20News%20Agency">Amaq News Agency</a> claimed the attack was carried out in response to the call for targeting states in the <a href="Military%20intervention%20against%20ISIL">anti-ISIS coalition</a>, of which Spain is a member, contributing about 400 soldiers training Iraqi army and police forces. Spain also has 150 soldiers in Mali as part of <a href="Operation%20Serval">Operation Serval</a>. According to "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>," Spain has also featured in ISIS propaganda supporting recovery of <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> and targetting the <a href="Sagrada%20Fam%C3%ADlia">Sagrada Família</a> basilica.

Reactions.
Domestic.
<a href="Mossos%20d%27Esquadra">Mossos d'Esquadra</a>, the police force of Catalonia, launched a "gàbia" (cage) operation to locate the perpetrators.

Jean Hamlin

Jean Hamlin (fl 1682-1684, last name occasionally Hamyln) was a French pirate active in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and off the coast of Africa. He was often associated with <a href="St.%20Thomas">St. Thomas</a>’ pirate-friendly Governor <a href="Adolph%20Esmit">Adolph Esmit</a>.

History.
Hamlin began his career in 1682, sailing from <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> in a small <a href="sloop">sloop</a> loaded with 120 men, with which he took the frigate "La Trompeuse" (The Trickster), which itself had changed hands between a number of pirates. He quickly looted eighteen Jamaican ships, causing Jamaica’s Governor <a href="Thomas%20Lynch%20%28governor%29">Thomas Lynch</a> to send two ships after him. The first missed him; the second, "HMS Guernsey", found Hamlin but was outpaced by the freshly <a href="Careening">careened</a> "Trompeuse", which “sailed three feet to his one.” Lynch recruited retired pirate turned pirate-hunter <a href="John%20Coxon%20%28pirate%29">John Coxon</a> to bring in Hamlin; Coxon was unsuccessful, so Lynch tried hiring buccaneer <a href="Jan%20Willems">Jan “Yankey” Willems</a>, who refused even to look for Hamlin.

With so much pressure on his operations, Hamlin left his hideout at <a href="%C3%8Ele-%C3%A0-Vache">Île-à-Vache</a> and sailed to St. Thomas where he was sheltered by Dutch Governor Adolph Esmit. Early in 1683 he began attacking English ships near <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> (letting a French ship go free), returning to St. Thomas where Esmit helped him sell off his plunder. He sailed for <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> off the African coast in May, capturing seventeen Dutch and English vessels. Some of his crew split off under a Captain Morgan, taking a prize ship with them; Hamlin returned to St. Thomas. Hamlin had reportedly been very cruel to the crews of captured ships, leading <a href="Nevis">Nevis</a>’ Governor William Stapleton to call him “John Hamlin, the arch murderer and torturer.”

The English found him there in late 1683 and the "HMS Francis" attacked. They were fired on not only by the 32-gun "Trompeuse" but by the Dutch fort, which infuriated the English. Finally the English captured and burned "Trompeuse", which exploded and set fire to another vessel left in the harbor. Hamlin escaped and Esmit protected him at <a href="Charlotte%20Amalie%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Charlotte Amalie</a> yet again. Hamlin formed a new crew late in 1684 for his ship "La Nouvelle Trompeuse" (The New Tricketer), which had been fitted out in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. Esmit was removed from his post by exasperated Dutch officials in October 1684, so Hamlin left for his old refuge at Île-à-Vache, and then to <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>. There are few records of his subsequent activities, though almost fifty of his former crew signed aboard the ship of privateer Jan Willems, who had previously refused to hunt down Hamlin.

The original "Trompeuse" which burned at St. Thomas was reportedly found by divers in 1990 but its authenticity is disputed. Legends persist that Hamlin’s loot – “treasure room was full of silver … over 24,000 pounds there” – is still aboard.

Cox and <a href="Patricia%20Devine">Devine</a> have conducted research on the cognitive structure of stereotypes, demonstrating that some stereotypes primarily serve as categorization cues, especially those stereotypes related to social groups with non-visible defining features, like gay men. Whereas other researchers have argued that people have an accurate "<a href="gaydar">gaydar</a>" ability that enables people to visually identify whether someone is gay or straight, Cox, Devine, and their colleagues argued that "gaydar" is simply an alternate label for using <a href="LGBT%20stereotypes">stereotypes</a> to infer <a href="Sexual%20orientation">orientation</a> (e.g., inferring that fashionable men are gay), and thereby serves the function of a <a href="Social%20dominance%20theory%23Legitimizing%20myths">legitimizing myth</a> to reduce the normative stigma associated with stereotyping. The researchers point out that past work arguing that people have accurate "gaydar" falls prey to the <a href="false%20positive%20paradox">false positive paradox</a> (see also the <a href="base%20rate%20fallacy">base rate fallacy</a>), because the alleged accuracy discounts the very low base rate of LGB people in real populations, resulting in a scenario where the "accuracy" of gaydar reported in lab studies translates to high levels of inaccuracy in the real world.

Niclas Gillis

Niclas Gillis (born April 20, 1989) is a Swedish writer, director, producer, actor and editor, as well as the founder and CEO of The Collectif. As a director, he is known for his intimate human depictions, austere sensibility, and dark tone; most notably <a href="Hold%20Me%20Down%20%282017%20film%29">Hold Me Down</a> (2017) and the <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>: “I, David” campaign. He had his first starring role as an actor in <a href="The%20Ape%20%282009%20film%29">The Ape</a> (2009), directed by Jesper Ganslandt; and plays the leading role in Pool (2018), based on the novel by Per Hagman.

Early life.
Growing up in the outskirts of Stockholm, Sweden, Gillis began his career as a commercial director at age 17. He worked as a trailer producer for European television at <a href="Viasat">Viasat</a> in London during his summer break from high school and freelanced as a graphic designer for <a href="EA%20Games">EA Games</a> during his one semester at Berghs School of Communication in Stockholm. At the age of 19, Gillis enrolled in SUNY College at Old Westbury and moved to New York. As one of the only caucasian male students living on campus, Gillis became troubled by the societal inequities he observed. After witnessing an 18-year-old girl have sex with a man on the floor of a crowded room for single dollar bills at a classmate's party, Gillis asked her if she was okay and was shocked to discover how common she described her struggle to be. The experience prompted him to more seriously study American history and its bearings on the present-day state of affairs, eventually leading him to make Hold Me Down.

Due to his lack of financial resources, Gillis only stayed at SUNY for one semester and resorted instead to autodidacticism to hone his craft as a filmmaker. Between 2009 and 2014, he worked as a contributing writer on film for The Last Magazine, a story analyst for <a href="Universal%20Pictures%20International">Universal Pictures International</a>, and as a director of promotional shorts for The Line Hotel, <a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>, and Native Son, among others; the last of which was compared to <a href="Pier%20Paolo%20Pasolini">Pier Paolo Pasolini's</a> <a href="Teorema">Teorema</a> by <a href="New%20York%20Magazine">New York Magazine</a>.

Hold Me Down.
In 2014, Gillis began work on the drama short film Hold Me Down by revisiting the prostitution ring he glimpsed five years earlier. The film came to depict a day in the life of a 19-year-old single mother who works as a stripper at an illegal nightclub to support her child in the South Bronx. It was based on interviews he conducted with women in the circuit, filmed on location in the Mott Haven Housing Projects and in an actual brothel, and featured a cast consisting entirely of women who had lived the type of life that they portrayed. His goal was to give the women who had suffered life in silence the opportunity to tell their own story. The film was produced by The Collectif, More Media and Bob Film Sweden with support from IFP, The Swedish Film Institute and Sveriges Television. Following its world premiere at the <a href="Gothenburg%20Film%20Festival">Gothenburg International Film Festival</a> in 2017, Hold Me Down has been lauded by critics for its authoritative realism and the outstanding performances of the cast, and the women involved are no longer engaged in prostitution.

In 2017, Gillis was granted development funds from The Swedish Film Institute to write Trouble Child, the feature film that will follow Hold Me Down.

<doc id="54936496" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54936496" title="Polanisia erosa">
Polanisia erosa

Polanisia erosa is a sticky, small to large high <a href="Annual%20plant">annual</a> <a href="Herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a> species of flowering plant in the "<a href="Cleome">Cleome</a>" family, <a href="Cleomaceae">Cleomaceae</a>, known by the common name large clammyweed. It has narrow clover-like leaves, and cream-coloured, frilly flowers with a yellowish centre, looking a bit like a small butterfly or a set of elk antlers. It naturally occurs in dry and sandy habitats in Texas and adjacent parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.

Taxonomy.
The famous American botanist <a href="Thomas%20Nuttall">Thomas Nuttall</a> was the first to describe large clammyweed in 1834, which he placed in a new genus and naming it "Cristatella erosa". <a href="Amos%20Eaton">Amos Eaton</a> included the species in 1836 in the genus "Cleome" as "C. erosa". In 1842, <a href="Stephan%20Endlicher">Stephan Endlicher</a>, an Austrian botanist who was the director of the <a href="Botanical%20Garden%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Vienna">Vienna Botanical Garden</a> moved the species to a new genus and renamed it to "Cyrbasium erosum", which is an <a href="Nomen%20illegitimum">illegitimate name</a>. In 1958 <a href="Hugh%20Iltis">Hugh Iltis</a> concluded the species could better be assigned to the genus "Polanisia", a name that has <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">priority</a> over "Cristatella", since it was already erected by <a href="Constantine%20Samuel%20Rafinesque">Constantine Samuel Rafinesque</a> in 1819, and made the <a href="Combinatio%20nova">new combination</a> "P. erosa". Iltis distinguished between two subspecies, the nominate and subspecies "breviglandulosa".

Description.
Large clammyweed is a small to large sticky but unscented annual herb of . It has branched or unbranched, green or purple stems with seated glands and <a href="Trichomes%23Aerial%20surface%20hairs">glandular hairs</a>. The long, green or purple <a href="petiole%20%28botany%29">leaf stalks</a> are often at an angle with the leaf blade. The leaf blade consists of three narrow, long and only wide, somewhat fleshy leaflets, the right and left halfs more or less folded towards each other (or conduplicate) with entire margins, a pointed top with a needle-like tip, the underside of the leaf with many, and the upper side with few glands. The <a href="Floral_symmetry%23Zygomorphic">bilaterally symmetrical</a> flowers are set in gland-covered <a href="raceme">raceme</a>s that are initially long but that keep growing to when fruits are ripe. Each individual flower is subtended by a <a href="bract">bract</a>s consisting of one or three entire bractlets, which have an oval shape and are long. The <a href="Pedicel%20%28botany%29">stalk of the individual flower</a> is 1−2⅓ cm (0.4-0.9 in) long. The four deciduous, eventually deflected, green to purple coloured, hairless <a href="sepal">sepal</a>s are <a href="Glossary%20of%20leaf%20morphology%23lanceolate">lanceolate</a> to <a href="Glossary%20of%20leaf%20morphology%23obovate">inverted egg-shaped</a>, 2½–3½ mm (0.1–0.14 in) long and ¾–1¼ mm (0.03–0.05 in) wide, with entire margins and a pointy tip. The four petals are mostly creamy white, oblong-ovate, consist of a more yellowish straight and narrow <a href="Petal%23Shape%20and%20size">claw</a> and a wide <a href="Petal%23Shape%20and%20size">plate</a>. The forward directed lower (<a href="Glossary_of_botanical_terms%23abaxial">abaxial</a>) pair is long and 2½–3 mm (0.10-0.12 in) wide the upper ⅔ deeply incised to create nine or ten finger-like lobes, often themselves bilobed at the tip (also described as a <a href="Glossary_of_botanical_terms%23lacerate">lacerate</a> margin). The upper ((<a href="Glossary_of_botanical_terms%23adaxial">adaxial</a>) pair is long and 3½–5 mm (0.12-0.20 in) wide, less deeply incised with four to six finger-like lobes. The tube-shaped <a href="nectar">nectar</a>ies are yellow, but become purple when drying and are 1-5½ mm (0.02–0.12 in) long. There are six to fifteen <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s that reach beyond the petals, consist of purple 1–1⅓ cm (0.4-0.5 in) <a href="Stamen%23Morphology%20and%20terminology">filaments</a> topped by purple, 1–1½ mm (0.04–0.06 in) long <a href="Stamen%23Morphology%20and%20terminology">anthers</a>, which do not coil when the pollen is released. The long <a href="Ovary%20%28botany%29">ovary</a> sits on the end of a <a href="gynophore">gynophore</a> that grows to a length of when the fruit is ripe, and is topped with a 2½–4½ mm (0.10–0.18 in) long style that persists and ends in a green stigma. The fruit is a <a href="Capsule%20%28fruit%29">capsules</a> of long and ¼–½ cm (0.1-0.2 in) in diameter, with a netted surface with or without some glandular hairs. Each capsule contains twelve to forty, globular to ovate, dark reddish brown seeds of 1½–1¾ mm (0.06–0.07 in), with a nobbly surface.

Subspecies.
"Polanisia erosa" subsp. "erosa" that grows in eastern Texas and adjacent Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma has about long nectaries, a gynophore when the fruit is ripe, and the largest petals are . In "Polanisia erosa" subsp. "breviglandulosa" from southernmost Texas however, those measuments are 1½ mm (0.06 in) for the nectaries, for the gynophore and for the petals.

Distribution and habitat.
Large clammyweed naturally occurs in Texas and adjacent parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, where it can be found in fields, prairies, sandy hillsides and open woodland.

The BOC said that they acted on an intelligence report relayed to them by the <a href="General%20Administration%20of%20Customs">General Administration of Customs</a> of China. The seizure was made in accordance to a Letter of Authority issued by BOC Commissioner <a href="Nicanor%20Faeldon">Nicanor Faeldon</a>.

2011 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts theft

The 2011 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts theft took place in two separate incidents during September and October of that year. In both instances the same thief took a small ancient stone piece that was openly exhibited, without a protective case, and smuggled it out of <a href="Montreal%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts">the museum</a>. One has since been recovered; however the thief remains unidentified and the whereabouts of the other are not known.

On September 3, one day before the anniversary of the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings, the only other theft in the museum's history, a visitor took a Roman marble head from its pedestal. In late October, he returned to take a <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> <a href="relief">relief</a>. The two works were collectively valued at $1.3 million, with the relief accounting for almost all of that amount.

The museum did not disclose the theft until February 2012 to avoid compromising the joint investigation by its insurance company and <a href="Suret%C3%A9%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec">Sureté du Québec</a>'s <a href="art%20theft">art theft</a> unit. <a href="Security%20camera">Security camera</a> footage allowed them to obtain a description of the thief; investigators believed he was local. A reward was offered for the return of the works.

In 2013, police were led to Simon Metke, an <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> man who had bought the Achaemenid piece for <a href="Canadian%20dollar">CDN$</a>1,400 during a visit to Montreal two years earlier, believing it to possibly be a replica, after it was seen on a wall behind him during a <a href="CBC%20News">CBC</a> interview unrelated to the case. The museum ultimately declined to buy it back from their insurer and it was put on the market in late 2016. Charges laid against him were disposed with a <a href="discharge%20%28sentence%29">conditional discharge</a> after he pled guilty to <a href="Possession%20of%20stolen%20goods%23Canada">possession of stolen property</a>. Metke's story inspired a character in <a href="Kevin%20Smith">Kevin Smith</a>'s 2016 film "<a href="Yoga%20Hosers">Yoga Hosers</a>", as well as the film's title.

Thefts.
On September 3, 2011, a visitor who came to the museum shortly after it opened removed a <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> <a href="relief">relief</a> depicting a soldier's head, produced during the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, which ruled Persia during the 5th century BCE. It was small and secured to the wall it was on only by an anchor, and otherwise unprotected by glass. The museum staff has not been able to determine how it was removed. Coincidentally, the theft occurred on the day before the 39th anniversary of the only other theft from the museum, the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings, all but one of which are still missing, the largest art theft in Canadian history.

The thief returned approximately eight weeks later, in late October, at the same time of day. This time he took a 1st-century Roman marble head, approximately the same size, from its pedestal. Like the earlier piece, it was secured there by an anchor, but otherwise unprotected, not even by a glass case.

Investigation.
When it discovered the pieces, both of which were part of the museum's permanent <a href="Collection%20%28artwork%29">collection</a>, missing, the museum called the <a href="Suret%C3%A9%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec">Sureté du Québec</a>'s (SQ) <a href="art%20theft">art theft</a> unit, the only one in any Canadian provincial police force, and <a href="AXA">AXA</a>, its insurance company, which also dispatched a team of art-theft specialists. They investigated the case jointly. After reviewing <a href="security%20camera">security camera</a> footage and interviewing museum staff who had been on duty the days of the thefts, they identified a suspect, a man tall who wore a baseball cap and dark jacket as he walked around the musuem. They believed he spoke French and lived in the Montreal area.

The museum did not publicly disclose the thefts until January 2012 in order to avoid compromising the investigation. When it did inform the news media, it released a description of the suspect and offered rewards for both the thief's identity and the safe return of the missing items. It put their combined value at $1.3 million, most of which was accounted for by the older, Achaemenid piece, with the Roman head valued at a mere $40,000.

John Fossey, an archaeologist, told <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a> later that he believed the two pieces had not been stolen to order but simply because they were "small [and] easy to put in the bag." Another expert involved, art-theft investigator Mark Dalrymple, observed that the case was similar to a series of 2004 thefts from the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Ontario">Art Gallery of Ontario</a> in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, which also involved small objects taken by visitors while the museum was open to the public, objects whose return he had secured. He said the museum was preparing photos for dissemination worldwide. "[N]o matter where in the world these pieces go, no one can sell them", he told "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>". He advised anyone in possession of the missing art to return it immediately.

Sale of relief.
Unbeknownst to Dalrymple or any of the other investigators, by the time he made that statement at least one of the missing pieces had already been sold. In November 2011 Simon Metke, a <a href="Yoga%20as%20exercise">yoga</a> teacher from <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, travelled to Montreal for a visit. A friend of his there had told him that someone he knew was selling what he described as a stone sculpture of a soldier, claiming it was a genuine antiquity. As a result of his own recent spiritual explorations, Metke had developed an interest in ancient cultures, and the friend thought he might be interested in buying the sculpture.

When Metke finally saw the sculpture, actually the Achaemenid <a href="relief">relief</a> that had been stolen from the museum a few months earlier, he was at first skeptical. He believed it might actually be a replica, something that he might otherwise find at modern stores that sell home decor. But he appreciated the workmanship that had gone into it.

The seller's asking price was <a href="Canadian%20dollar">CDN$</a>1,400. According to Metke's friend, the seller was motivated. "This other guy had to pay his child support you know and pay his rent," Metke recalled later. "He edged me on that it was worth a bunch more."

Still, Metke had some lingering doubts about the item. So he did a <a href="Google">Google</a> search on "Are there any <a href="Mesopotamian">Mesopotamian</a> artifacts missing?" After he had satisfied himself from the results that he was not buying something looted or stolen, he bought the item, believing that, with <a href="2012%20phenomenon">2012</a>, the last year in the <a href="Mayan%20Calendar">Mayan Calendar</a>, a month away, it was his destiny to acquire the artwork. "It symbolized part of my spiritual journey to me."

He thought "it would have been kind of fun" to take it to an "<a href="Antiques%20Roadshow">Antiques Roadshow</a>" production, or go to the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> himself and have it authenticated. For the time being, he packed the piece in his luggage and flew with it back to Edmonton, where the airline briefly lost the suitcase containing the relief upon his arrival. Once it was located, he took it home and put it in a <a href="meditation">meditation</a> area he had set up in his living room.

Later he moved it to a shelf in his bedroom, where he put it amid a collection of "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28franchise%29">Star Wars</a>" action figures, crystals and stuffed animals. A month after returning to Edmonton, he gave an interview to a <a href="CBC%20News">CBC News</a> crew for a story unrelated to the artwork he had just purchased. It was, however, visible on the shelf behind him in some shots.

Recovery of relief and arrests.
The interview eventually led to a tip to police. In late 2013 they obtained a <a href="search%20warrant">warrant to search</a> Metke's Edmonton condominium, and in January 2014 executed it. "The sun's coming in through the window, the bougainvillea flowers are glowing, the crystals are making rainbows," recalled Metke.

A team of <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP) from both <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> and <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, along with the SQ/AXA investigators, quickly located the relief. It was only then that Metke learned it had been stolen, and was indeed an authentic antique artifact 2,500 years old, not a replica. "I don't think he knew it was worth $1.2 million dollars either," he said of the seller. He felt, again, that it was destiny that had brought the relief to him. "[I]t sort of feels like it may have come to me to be protected so that it didn't get destroyed or lost."

At the time of the arrest, police suggested they had some leads on the identity of the thief. However, as of 2017 no arrests have been made. The whereabouts of the Roman head are also unknown.

Police charged Metke with <a href="Possession%20of%20stolen%20goods%23Canada">possession of stolen property over $5,000 in value</a>, possession of the proceeds of a crime, and possessing a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, after they also found drugs in the residence. Metke's girlfriend faced the former two charges related to the relief as well. Fossey, who was in Edmonton that day as well, flew home to Montreal with the relief that night. "It's a day I'll never forget, flying back with it in a box at my feet," he said later. 

The museum, however, would have to consider whether to buy it back from AXA, since once it was recovered it became the insurer's legal property; commonly a buyback clause in the policy allows a museum to do this by returning the money paid. The board said it would meet to consider the possibility. It decided not to, and in 2016 it was offered for sale at the <a href="Frieze%20Art%20Fair">Frieze Art Fair</a> for £2.2 million.

Trial.
The Crown later <a href="Stay%20of%20proceedings">stayed</a> two of the three charges against Metke, and all that it had laid against his girlfriend. In April 2017, he pled guilty to the possession of stolen goods charge. A statement of facts his lawyers agreed on with prosecutors said that while he clearly was unaware the relief had been stolen, he could have done more to assure himself that it was not. In return the judge gave him a <a href="discharge%20%28sentence%29">conditional discharge</a> with <a href="probation">probation</a> and <a href="community%20service">community service</a>. Both sides described the case as "unique" and "extraordinary".

"Yoga Hosers".
At the time of Metke's arrest, American filmmaker <a href="Kevin%20Smith">Kevin Smith</a> discussed the story on his <a href="podcast">podcast</a>, "<a href="SModcast">SModcast</a>", amused by Metke's description of the bougainvillea and crystals that morning. His co-host, <a href="Scott%20Mosier">Scott Mosier</a>, imagined how the RCMP might have spoken to Metke, saying "Open up, yoga <a href="hoser">hoser</a>!" The last two words became a minor <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a> among their fans.

In April, Smith announced he was working on a screenplay called "<a href="Yoga%20Hosers">Yoga Hosers</a>". He completed the film in time for the January 2016 <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. It was not based on Metke's story, but one character in the film, a <a href="yoga%20as%20exercise">yoga</a> instructor named Yogi Bayer, was inspired by Metke. <a href="Justin%20Long">Justin Long</a>, who played Bayer, attempted to contact Metke while preparing for the role; Metke did not respond until after Long had shot his scenes.

France has a <a href="consulate%20general">consulate general</a> in <a href="Erbil">Erbil</a> and Kurdistan Region has a representation in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. The ties between France and Kurdistan Region have been very close since the presidency of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterand">François Mitterand</a> (1981-1995), when his wife <a href="Danielle%20Mitterrand">Danielle Mitterrand</a> played an instrumental role in the campaign for the <a href="Iraqi%20no-fly%20zones">no fly zone over Kurdistan Region</a> in 1991. France has a military presence in Kurdistan Region, and Consul General Dominique Mas described their relations as being "historic" and "long-term".

History.
Mitterrand (1981-1995).
In 1982, First Lady Danielle Mitterrand played an active role in the formation of the <a href="Kurdish%20Institute%20of%20Paris">Kurdish Institute of Paris</a> by making public awareness around it. In 1989, she organized that 1,000 Kurdish refugees would be taken in by France with consent from the President and the government. She also visited Kurdistan Region in 1991, visiting refugees at the Iran-Iraq border, and again in July 1992 to witness the establishment of the <a href="Iraqi%20Kurdistan%20Parliament">Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament</a>. In 2011, <a href="Jonathan%20Randal">Jonathan Randal</a> wrote that: "In France, Danielle Mitterrand, the former President’s wife and vociferous defender of the Kurds and other downtrodden minorities, needed no encouragement to bring their plight to her husband’s attention. When in late March 1991 the Iraqi counteroffensive gathered steam, she alerted specialists inside and outside the government to prepare contingency plans. She had been sensitized to the Kurds by, among others, Bernard Dorin, a diplomat who abruptly gave up his career to work for the Kurds without knowing much about them."

Chirac (1995-2012).
In an interview with <a href="L%27essentiel%20%28newspaper%29">L'essentiel</a> in 2012, Kurdish President <a href="Massoud%20Barzani">Massoud Barzani</a> stated that Kurdistan Region had no direct relations with President <a href="Chirac">Chirac</a>, but had contacts to several ministers including Minister of the Interior <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>.

Sarkozy (2007-2012).
Under the presidency of Sarkozy, a French embassy office was opened in Erbil with the presence of French Foreign Minister Kouschner. In 2010, Kouschner described Sarkozy's approachment to the Kurds as being a revitalizing of their relations. In the same year, Massoud Barzani met with President Nicolas Sarkozy and Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner in Paris, where they signed a protocol strengthening ties in various fields, including trade, education and culture. Sarkozy commented at the relations and stated that: "France is happy with its friendship with Kurdistan and attaches great importance to this friendship."

Hollande (2012-2017).
Kurdish President <a href="Massoud%20Barzani">Massoud Barzani</a> has met with French President <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande">François Hollande</a> in Paris on three occasions; in 2014, 2015 and in 2016, while Hollande visited Erbil in 2014 and 2017. French Defence Minister <a href="Jean-Yves%20Le%20Drian">Jean-Yves Le Drian</a> met Kurdish officials twice in 2016, once at the <a href="Munich%20Security%20Conference">Munich Security Conference</a> and once in Erbil.

Military aid.
In August 2014, France sent soldiers to Kurdistan Region to train Kurdish soldiers (<a href="Peshmerga">Peshmerga</a>). In January 2015, 40 more soldiers were sent to the region. In August 2014, France also supplied Kurdish soldiers with an undisclosed amount of weapons and 20 tons of humanitarian aid.

<doc id="54937695" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54937695" title="Subsurface Circular">
Subsurface Circular

Subsurface Circular is a text-based <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> developed and published by <a href="Mike%20Bithell%20Games">Mike Bithell Games</a>. The game was released for <a href="Windows">Windows</a>-based <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s on 17 August 2017.

Gameplay.
"Subsurface Circular" is a loose take on text-based <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a>, with the game is presented in a three-dimension, third-person perspective. The player controls a robot detective in a futuristic setting, tasked to solve cases aboard a subway system below a human city that ferries around other robots that serve as the workforce. In the game, the robot detective must solve a case of a number of robots that have gone missing, by talking to other robots while they are on the subway cars, following various <a href="conversation%20tree">conversation tree</a>s, and at times, solving puzzles to help out a robot and get more information. The player acquires "focal points" on achieving certain goals, which then can be used to question other robots to get more information to solve the mystery.

Plot.
Theta One One, the playable character, is a Tek, assigned as a detective for other Teks on a subway system and serving his human masters, known as "management". During one night, one Tek, a fabricator, tells Theta One One of another Tek that had gone missing, and Theta One One decides to take the case. As the subway train circles the city, Theta One One talks to other Tek passengers, learning of a mysterious Red Tek that may be connected to the mystery, that a number of other Teks may have gone missing, and that there is growing resent to Teks by the human population in the city above. Eventually, Theta One One is able to upload the case details to management, upon which they inform the Tek that since it took the case without their instructions, the Tek will be apprehended. At the next station, two detective Teks arrive, preparing to deal with Theta One One, but the Tek is able to manipulate the pair to learn that over hundreds of Teks have gone missing over the last several months, and to management, they saw this as a <a href="Round-off%20error">rounding error</a> in Tek production, and thus why it seems Teks have gone missing. The detective Teks use an override access code to reset Theta One One to an unassigned position and leave him to get off later on the subway ride to take itself to fabrication and be reassigned.

Theta One One is still experiencing the sense of loss when at the next stop it meets an infantry Tek who seeks to confess its sins. Theta One One manages to cox this out of the Tek, and learns that it was part of the plan to overproduce infantry Teks that have been amassing outside of the city above, preparing to attack it. At the next stop, the same fabricator that Theta One One first talked to that night comes aboard, and reveals it was the Red Tek others spoke of, and is leading this plan. It planned to use the infantry Teks to kill management and have Teks take over which could run the city more efficiently; this would help the humans working low-level jobs to be able to pursue more constructive options while Teks replace their roles. Otherwise, without this change, the system will continue on the status quo, with management using Teks to replace humans, and hurting many humans in the process. Red Tek needed Theta One One to investigate as it did as to scout the current situation in the city from the Tek's perspective, providing its high-level intelligence to analyze the situation. At this point, Red Tek offers Theta One One a weapon and tells it that a choice to kill Red Tek or itself must be made; by killing Red Tek, Theta One One will be able to report to management about the infantry Teks and give them time to stop it, as to let the status quo remain; by killing itself, Theta One One would allow the Tek overthrow proceed. The game ends after the player makes either choice.

Development and release.
"Subsurface Circular" was developed by British video game designer and developer <a href="Mike%20Bithell">Mike Bithell</a> along with a small team. Bithell had been pitching another game idea during the March 2017 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>. He recognised that negotiations for launching development of this game would take several months, and wanted to keep busy during this time, thus starting development of "Subsurface Circular" shortly after his return. Bithell was inspired by old text adventure games such as those he programmed as a youth on the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a>, and decided to try creating a modern take on the genre with a short and focused narrative. He also wanted to explore the ideas of how robots will eventually replace humans as the primary workforce in the future, and how ethical and political issues around a sentient robotic workforce would be seen, comparing the situation to historical and modern-day insurgencies.

The game was announced and released for <a href="Windows">Windows</a>-based <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s on 17 August 2017. Bithell considers this as a first of his "Bithell Shorts", games that are short and inexpensive that allow him to experiment with narrative approaches, while he continued to work on his next major release. Bithell planned this as a short game, one that would "respect [ones] time" to be completed within a single play session and not linger and remain unfinished as many <a href="AAA%20%28video%20gaming%29">AAA</a> titles he felt can be. As he knew the game was short, he did not want to create great expectations for players, and opted to announce and release the game on the same day.

Reception.
"Subsurface Circular" was well received by professional critics. Praise was directed towards the game's engaging storytelling and writing.

"<a href="Polygon%20%28website%29">Polygon</a>" reviewer Colin Campbell welcomed Bithell's idea of creating a series of short, experimental and narrative-driven games. Campbell complimented "Subsurface Circular"s "rich narrative landscape" presented through its dialogue and characters.

Bradley considered the gameplay exceptional but "not groundbreaking by any means." Bradley noted that the graphics were "decent, but not spectacular," stating that they "have a cartoony look to them that fits with the television series." Bradley concluded, "This game is not the best shooter out there, but it is solid. It makes good use of the "MIB" license, and fans of the movie and cartoon should enjoy this game if they like first-person shooters at all."

Nautical Museum of Litochoro

The seafaring of the inhabitants of the Greek mountain village <a href="Litochoro">Litochoro</a> has a long tradition which is represented in the Nautical Museum (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> Ναυτικό Μουσείο Λιτοχώρου).

Location.
Litochoro is located on the eastern side of <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> in <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, 5 km from the sea and at an altitude of about 350 m. The museum is located in the municipal administration building.

History.
Until far into the 20th century, Litochoro was home to many shipowners and sailors. When the steamships displaced the sail ships, this era ended. In 1995 the members of the Association of the Retired Sailors of Litochoro were given the idea of documenting the legacy of maritime navigation and saving and preserving the cultural, maritime heritage of the place.

Between 1995 and 2002 maritime relics were collected within the (formerly) maritime families of the village. From 2002 to 2004 the exhibition pieces were gathered and brought together.

The "Nautical Museum of Litochoro", founded in 2004, is registered in the Greek Ministry of Culture as an "institution of cultural maritime heritage". Since its inception, the scope of the shown exhibits has been constantly expanded.

The museum.
The exhibits are either collected from the households of the former seafarers or were donated by shipowners or the navy. In front of the building are anchors, buoys, ships propellers and a torpedo. Although the museum is dedicated to merchant shipping, the tour begins with a model of a torpedo boat, which, in 1912, sank a Turkish warship in front of the port of Thessaloniki. Old pictures, some almost 100 years old, show proud families in the shipyard who supervise the construction of their ship. Other pictures show sailors on board or in port. In several showcases are impressive ship models. Many of these are original replicas of ships that were once home here. Others represent a cross-section of traditional Greek ships over the centuries.

This is followed by nautical devices such as <a href="compasses">compasses</a>, <a href="chronometers">chronometers</a> and <a href="sextants">sextants</a>. Although displaced by modern technology such as <a href="GPS">GPS</a>, these devices are still mandatory on board. If they fail or do not work correctly, threaten penalties. Furthermore, nautical charts and <a href="logarithm%20tables">logarithm tables</a> are needed to determine the exact position of the ship.

The men who have not returned from the sea are devoted to a memorial plaque. It is noticeable that sometimes whole families fell victim to <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon's</a> whims.

The exhibitions.
In the months of July and August separate exhibitions take place. The themes and the shown exhibits change every year. In 2016 ship models of the model builder Dimitris Maras were shown. In 2017, an exhibition will be held on the history of officer training in Greece.

The Wind-Up Doll

The Wind-Up Doll is a poem by <a href="Forough%20Farrokhzad">Forough Farrokhzad</a>.

Analysis.
Examining <a href="Forough%20Farrokhzad">Farokhzad’s</a> poems enables us to understand the environment in which she lived in. “The Wind-Up Doll,” written in the time of the Pahlavi kings, conveys the psychological frustrations of women in a restrictive time where women were treated like objects and are suppressed. At the end of the poem, the speaker sarcastically says, “Ah, so happy am I!” At that time, the monarch himself decided for the condition of women. For example, once he ordered prohibiting the use of the chador by women in public in 1935 even though society still had traditional views regarding women. In the poem "The Wind Up Doll", <a href="Forough%20Farrokhzad">Farrokhzad</a> challenges the restrictive role of Iranian women and presents the thoughts and emotions of women seeking greater respect and rights.

About the author.
<a href="Forough%20Farrokhzad">Forough Farrokhzad</a> (1935-1967) was one of the most influential Persian poets and is still the voice of women in Iran. She began composing poetry since she was 13 or 14. She married a man who was much older than her when she was 16 and divorced her husband soon after. Many of her poetries were focused on feminism and have remained important and significant after long time. <a href="Forough%20Farrokhzad">Farrokhzad’s</a> obsession with the society made her protest against the existing standards of living and that is why her poems have been banned since revolution of Iran in 1979. She was one of the first female poets who protested against inequality between genders and broke taboos in Iran. She died tragically in a car accident when she was only 32-years-old.

Anthony T. Rinaldi

Anthony T. Rinaldi is an American engineer, builder and a businessman who has been involved in the construction and development of high-rise residential towers, rental and condominium complexes, hotel structures and large commercial projects throughout New York City, Westchester, New Jersey, Florida and Arizona. On December 18, 2003, Rinaldi founded and launched The Rinaldi Group, LLC., a commercial general contracting and construction management firm located in Secaucus, New Jersey, outside New York City’s Lincoln Tunnel. As of 2016, The Rinaldi Group, LLC., has sales in excess of $300 million.

Early Life.
Rinaldi was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He is the only child and son of the late Anthony T. Rinaldi, II, a decorated police captain and Mary Rinaldi, an bowling prodigy in Missouri. Rinaldi's father was a 33-year veteran of the Hoboken Police Department, Hoboken, New Jersey and a World War II veteran where he was a member in Seabee, the United States Naval Construction batallion in the United States Navy. Rinaldi's mother on the other hand was an amateur bowling champion who competed throughout Hudson County, New Jersey, and who is also a hall of fame amateur bowler whose bowling accomplishments have been recorded in the National Bowling Museum & Hall of Fame, located in St. Louis, Missouri. Rinaldi's father was a significant figure in his life, although he died when Rinaldi was only 19 and a freshman in college.

Much of Anthony Rinaldi's correlation with Construction and development rose from the influence of his father who in his own service was working with the Naval Construction Battalions, construction force conceived as a replacement for the civilian construction companies after the United States was drawn into World War II.

Education.
Rinaldi attended the Secaucus High School in Secaucus, New Jersey and was a K-12 graduate of the Secaucus Public School System, where he excelled both academically as well as athletically. Having graduated with honors and a 3.4 out of 4.0 GPA (A-) and named to the Star Ledger’s 1st-Team All-State Honors in 1983, he was named twice to Who’s Who Among American High School Students both in 1981–82 and in 1982–83. 

In his youth Rinaldi received numerous athletic scholarships to play college baseball and was considered one of the top professional catching prospects in the nation, landing tryouts with the then California Angels, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cleveland Indians. However, considering his orthodox upbringing and influence of his father, Rinaldi chose the path of college over a professional career in baseball and pursued an engineering degree.

Professional Life.
Between the years 1997 and 2003, Rinaldi served two 3-year terms as the Trustee of the Board of Education and as the Chairman of the Buildings & Grounds Committee. Rinaldi also served as the Co-Chairman of the Technology Committee in the District of Secaucus, County of Hudson, New Jersey. After his freshman year, Rinaldi was voted Chairman of the Buildings & Grounds Committee for 5-years by multiple District presidents sitting on both sides of the political aisle, during which he led the District’s campaigning that ultimately resulted in the approval of a $7 million bond referendum for additions, alterations and MEPS (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing & Sprinkler) modernizations of 2-elementary schools, namely Clarendon and Huber Street Elementary School. Rinaldi and the firm led the design-teams of John Veisz of the architectural firm Faridy, Veisz, Fraytak and Brian Meade of Thomson Meade Vincentsen Consulting, and provided pro-bono value-engineering services and expertise that helped maintain the project’s overall budget by limiting change order extras to less than 1%. 

During his tenure in his second term, Rinaldi led a 1-year campaign that resulted in the approval of a $14 million bond referendum for the new ground-up construction of a 1,000 seat Performing Arts Center. Working together with the design team of John Veisz and Brian Meade, Rinaldi and his firm provided value-engineering, re-design services and expertise in assisting the District to finally make the overall project budget after two public bid attempts failed. 

Together with his co-chair, the District’s IT Manager & Network Administrator Alvaro E. Vega (the current IT Manager & Network Administrator of The Rinaldi Group) and the Board Secretary & Treasurer, Rinaldi led the charge of upgrading the District’s antiquated computer systems. The project provided the district administration with over 1,000 new computers, high capacity servers, state-of-the-art software and proprietary administrative system designs utilized by the school systems across four different buildings throughout the District.

S. Fannie Gerry Wilder

Sarah Frances "Fannie" Gerry Wilder (September 4, 1850 - April 26, 1923) was an American author.

Early life.
Sarah Frances Gerry was born in <a href="Standish%2C%20Maine">Standish, Maine</a>, on September 4, 1850. She was the daughter of Rev. Edwin Jerome Gerry (1820-1885) and Sophia J. Goodwin (1827 - 1898). Her father was settled over the Unitarian parish in that town seven years, then going to New York, where he was connected with the <a href="Children%27s%20Aid%20Society">Children's Aid Society</a> for five years, and finally accepted a rail from the Benevolent Fraternity of Churches to settle in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> as pastor of the Hanover Street Chapel, where he remained as minister for twenty-five years.

Gerry, although born in Maine, was essentially a Boston girl, as she was educated in the schools of that city and lived in the vicinity nearly all her life.

Career.
As S. Fannie Gerry grew to womanhood, her interest became naturally identified with her father's work, in assisting the poorer class among whom he labored. She was looked upon by the people of his parish as a sister, friend and helper. 

She was very fond of history and literature in her school-days, taking a high rank in composition during that time. After the death of her father, her desire became so great to place his work and life before the public, that it might serve to inspire others, that she wrote, in 1887, his memoir, entitled "The Story of a Useful Life: Edwin J. Gerry. 1820-1885".

Afterward she wrote for different papers and magazines, making a specialty of stories for children. Her love for the work increased every year, and in 1890 she published a book for young people, entitled "Boston Girls at Home and Abroad". She then published another book for young people, historical in character, entitled "Looking Westward: A Romance of 1620". 

She was an active member of the <a href="New%20England%20Woman%27s%20Press%20Association">New England Woman's Press Association</a>, and was connected with various other societies. She was elected secretary of the <a href="Arlington%2C%20Massachusetts">Arlington, Massachusetts</a>, branch of the Chautauqua Literary Social Circle for 1892.

Personal life.
On June 16, 1881 Sarah F. Gerry married Millard F. Wilder, a young business man of Arlington. They had one son, Edwin Gerry Wilder (February 29, 1884 - March 22, 1884), who died an infant.

She died on April 26, 1923, and is buried with her son and parents at Evergreen Cemetery, Leominster.

During the Friday Group’s <a href="S%C3%A9ance">séances</a> spirit leaders presented themselves by name and promised to help the group’s members in their spiritual training; such leaders are common in spiritualist literature and life. Through its spirit leaders the group was inspired to draw automatically in pencil, a technique that was not unusual at that time. When the hand moved automatically, the conscious will did not direct the pattern that developed on the paper, and, in theory, the women became artistic tools for their spirit leaders. In a series of sketchbooks, religious scenes and religious were depicted in drawings made by the group collectively. Their drawing technique developed in such a way that abstract patterns—dependent on the free movement of the hand—became visible.

Current microtransit providers include <a href="Bridj">Bridj</a>, Chariot, <a href="Lyft">Lyft Shuttle</a>, Split, and Via. It is form of public transportation in which routes can be dynamically generated.

The term may have emerged into widespread industry discussion around 2015. Various definitions of microtransit have been attempted:

IT-enabled private multi-passenger transportation services, such as Bridj, Chariot, Split, and Via, that serve passengers using dynamically generated routes, and may expect passengers to make their way to and from common pick-up or drop-off points. Vehicles can range from large SUVs to vans to shuttle buses. Because they provide transit-like service but on a smaller, more flexible scale, these new services have been referred to as microtransit.
and

Alternative transit services is a broad category that encompasses shuttles (shared vehicles that connect passengers to public transit or employment centers), paratransit, and private sector transit solutions commonly referred to as microtransit. Microtransit can include fixed route or flexible route services, as well as offer fixed schedules or on-demand service. In its most agile form (flexible routing, scheduling or both), microtransit and paratransit can be bundled under the category known as flexible transit services.

Sohrab Sepehri as a Nature Poet

<a href="Sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri</a> can be called a nature poet; throughout his poetry, he turns to the natural world to show that through nature they can find their true selves. Nature is visualization of God and it is manifestation of inspiration in <a href="Sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri’s</a> view so looking at every aspect of nature means paying attention to God. In fact through his poetry, <a href="Sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri</a> wants to convey that nature is alive and it has soul so people can see signs of God in all aspects of nature, even in mud and bur. <a href="Sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri</a> believe that everything is created for a valuable purpose in the nature and there is no futility in the world; therefore, all phenomena even those look ugly and hideous are manifestations of God (Isfahani, 2015).<br>

Sepehri's tendency to nature.
We can analyze the aspects of naturalism in all Sepehri's books. “The attractive aspects of Sohrab Sepehri’s poems are his tendency to nature, too much attention to natural effects and showing beautiful images of nature and world which make his poems interesting to read. In this way it is hard to find a poem among Sepehri’s poems that doesn’t imply nature and natural manifestations such as, flower, tree, forest, mountain and sea. Even this naturalism is notable in his first book, The Death of Color (1951); however, Sepehri talks about social and peripheral matters more because he has completely observed Nima Yoshij and his poetry. For example,

Silence has broken its bonds.

In the corner of a valley, a willow in full splendor stands.

In the twilight-colored sky

A white cloud passes by.

In his second book, The Life of Dreams (1953) the theme of his poems is naturalism so that the poet doesn’t have any purpose to compose the poetry except showing images of nature. This movement toward nature continues in his third book, Downpour of Sunshine (1958). The nature description in his fourth book, East of Sorrow (1961) leads us to Sepehri’s mental world and we see that Sepehri’s purpose of nature description is not only a simple description of nature and showing of its beautiful image, but the poet is looking for mysteries he cannot find in city and civilized urban life; therefore, he seeks refuge in the nature and talks about it. This nature description and naturalism is also considerable in his fifth book, The Sound of Footsteps of Water (1965). For example:<br>

Our garden was on the shadowy side of wisdom <br>

Our garden was the knotting place of feeling and foliage,

Our garden was in the focal point of encounter of eye, cage and mirror.

Our garden was perhaps an arc of green circle of bliss.<br>

(Footsteps of Water)<br>

This naturalism continues with a few differences in his sixth book, The Wayfarer (1966). Furthermore this attention to nature goes on again in his seventh book, Green Space (1967) with a few differences in expression. For example:

Frogs croak. At times, an owl hoots.

The mountain is so near: behind the ash and maple trees.

The plain is visible, not so the stones, nor the flowering bushes.

Shadows, like the loneliness of water, like the song of God, visible in the distance

(Lonely Exile)<br>

Finally in his last book, Us nil, us a look (1977) the presence of nature and natural objects are notable, but with another language and expression.” (Translation from original Farsi reference)<br>

<a href="sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri’s</a> most important book entitled Hasht Ketab or Eight books that is a compilation of his prior eight books of poetry. In Hasht Ketab or Eight books published in 1976, <a href="sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri</a> laments the loss of traditional Persian beliefs regarding courtesy and deeper connection between people. Furthermore, there are streaks of naturalism and nature description in <a href="sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri’s</a> poetry and this is notable in most poems of his books.<br>
“<a href="sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri</a> published his first poetry collection in 1951; entitled The Death of Color. In this Book, <a href="sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri</a> is affected by <a href="Nima%20Yooshij">Nima</a> and his manner.What makes up the content of his poems in this collection is issues such as futility, waiting for better days, the inner dilemma of the poet and loneliness. In addition, what governs the mood of the poems of this book, including the poems’ name is sadness and depression of romanticism. Two years later in 1953, <a href="sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri’s</a> second books, Life of Dreams published. The bitter mood of previous book is also visible in this book, but it has some signs of <a href="sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri’s</a> independence from Nima. In this regard, independence of <a href="sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri’s</a> style started from his second book and it continued in the other six books. Furthermore, following his independence from Nimaic poetry, the elements of surrealism were found in <a href="sohrab%20Sepehri">Sepehri’s</a> second book and the other six books because of his familiar with Western theosophy and its literary schools.” (Translation from original Farsi reference)

Grace Gemberling

Grace Gemberling (1903-1997) was an American artist known for the broad range of her subjects in paintings having a pronounced psychological as well as aesthetic impact. One critic said they conveyed a mood that was "ethereal, bold and engaged." Another said her work showed "a disciplined hand and a romantic eye" together with "a magical color sense." Known for her control of detail and successful handling of line and blocks of color, she was said to paint in a modernist style that stayed clear of abstraction and was remembered by a teacher and fellow artist as "the finest woman painter in Philadelphia during the 20s and 30s."

Early life and training.
Born in Philadelphia, Gemberling grew up in that city and at a farm her family owned in <a href="Selinsgrove%2C%20Pennsylvania">Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania</a>. She developed an interest in art while a student at <a href="Friends%27%20Central%20School">Friends' Central School</a>. With the encouragement of her parents, she enrolled in the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Academy%20of%20the%20Fine%20Arts">Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts</a> in 1920 and for the next three years she studied under <a href="Daniel%20Garber">Daniel Garber</a>, Hugh Breckenridge, and <a href="Arthur%20Beecher%20Carles">Arthur Carles</a>. Showing great promise as a student, she received the valuable <a href="Cresson%20Traveling%20Scholarship">Cresson Traveling Scholarship</a> in both 1923 and 1924.

Career.
 

Gemberling's career as a professional artist began after she returned from European travel in 1924 and decided not to continue attending classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. When in 1926 she exhibited with the Philadelphia Water Color Club, a reviewer said her painting, "Marine" was "gorgeous," and later that year when she exhibited at the <a href="The%20Plastic%20Club">Plastic Club</a>, the same reviewer praised a portrait of hers, "Anna Ruth," as "nicely spontaneous." Thereafter, her paintings appeared frequently in Philadelphia exhibitions and quite often received favorable notice. From 1930 onwards, she showed in other East Coast locations including the <a href="Corcoran%20Gallery%20of%20Art">Corcoran</a> Biennials of 1930 and 1935 in Washington, D.C.; the Salons of America and <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Women%20Artists">National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors</a> exhibitions of 1932 in New York; and exhibitions held by the <a href="North%20Shore%20Art%20Association">North Shore Art Association</a> of Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1932 and 1933.

Artistic style.
During the course of her career critics frequently noticed Gemberling's competent handling of color and her skill in design and execution. 

Critics singled out specific paintings for discussion. Regarding "Otakar Sevcik" C. H. Bonte of the "Philadelphia Inquirer" wrote: “Her so called ‘sketch’ of Professor Otakar Sevcik (1852-1936) is a creation of so much life, charm and dignity of coloring as to constitute a finished portrait." Of her "Amusement Park" Edward Alden Jewell of the "New York Times" wrote: "Grace Thorp Gemberling's "Amusement Park" young ladies look quite as indisposed as ever. Those who pin their admiration exclusively to subject will doubtless turn away from protagonists so depressing, but the judicious can hardly fail to admire this painter's astuteness in constructing a picture." 

In reviewing an untitled landscape Scott Chalfont wrote in an exhibition catalog: "So characteristic of Gemberling’s finest talent, in this landscape she takes a scene and makes it her own. From the wispy trees, to the dark skies and vibrant houses, the contrasts create a compelling painting." In 1938 a critic wrote: " As personal as are the creations of Grace Gemberling, there is extraordinary variety in her canvasses. The artist’s delineation of well-worn houses is unique as her interpretation of them in color, and there is nothing we like more than the simple but fruitful wedding of line and color mass. Control of detail is, in this case, an additional gift. Canvases may be flooded with subsidiary graphic or pigmental themes, but there is never confusion. Grace Gemberling is one of Philadelphia’s most promising painters.” 

Concerning the painting "Colonial Stairway" Chalfont wrote: "One of the more realistically interpreted compositions by Gemberling, this is clearly the “Montmorenci“ Stair Hall at Winterthur Museum. Wonder- fully rendered, this painting invites the viewer into the opulence of the interior and demonstrates her deep ap- preciation for the Winterthur Museum and the impressive collection within."

Exhibitions and awards.
The exhibitions in which Gemberling participated were mostly non-commercial. The two organizations that showed her work more than any others were both ones where she had been a student: She contributed paintings, watercolors, and drawings to nearly all the annual exhibitions held by the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts between 1927 and 1943 and to many of the annual exhibitions held at Friends' Central School between 1934 and 1955. Other non-commercial organizations that showed her work on multiple occasions included the Plastic Club of Philadelphia, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the North Shore Art Association, and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. Non-commercial organizations that showed her a single time included the <a href="Saint%20Louis%20Art%20Museum">City Art Museum of St. Louis</a> (1930), Salons of America (New York, 1932), Philadelphia Water Color Club (1926), <a href="National%20Academy%20Museum%20and%20School">National Academy of Design</a> (New York, 1932), <a href="Whitney%20Museum%20of%20American%20Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a> (New York, 1934), <a href="Society%20of%20Independent%20Artists">Society of Independent Artists</a> (New York, 1934), Studio House (Washington, D.C., 1936), Women's University Club (Philadelphia, 1938), Federal Art Project show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1938), and Everyman's Gallery (Art Alliance, Philadelphia, 1953).

Her relatively few exhibitions in private galleries included a solo exhibition at the Mellon Galleries in Philadelphia (1933), Gimbel Galleries in Philadelphia (1935) and group shows at the Boyer Gallery's two locations, Philadelphia, and New York (both in 1936). 

Gemberling was known for the number of important awards she had won. Most came from the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Academy%20of%20the%20Fine%20Arts">Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts</a>, which honored her twice with its highly valued student award, the <a href="Cresson%20Traveling%20Scholarship">Cresson Traveling Scholarship</a>, in 1923 and 1924, and twice with its Fellowship Prize, given by members of the Academy to one of its own (1931, 1940). It also awarded her the Lambert Purchase Prize and the <a href="Mary%20Smith%20Prize">Mary Smith Prize</a> for best painting by a Philadelphia woman artist, both in1930, and a Gold Medal for her painting "Landscape." She also won the Oliver Beck Figure Composition Prize from the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Women%20Artists">National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors</a> in1933.

Art teacher.
During the 1930s Gemberling gave art instruction in her studio in <a href="Bala%20Cynwyd%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania</a>. One of her students, <a href="Jane%20Piper">Jane Piper</a>, later became a well-known artist.

Personal life and family.
Gemberling was born on July 31, 1903. Her parents were Joseph Burton Gemberling and Lulu Sarah Thorp Gemberling who married December 28, 1898, and whose home was in "Ivy Cottage," Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Her father was born in <a href="Selinsgrove%2C%20Pennsylvania">Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania</a> in 1867 and died in 1943. He was a successful construction manager for a company that built bridges. Her mother was born in 1880.
Gemberling had an older sister named Josephine who performed in concert on the violin in the years prior to her marriage in 1927 to Donald Robb Cochran. The family spent summer vacations on the Gemberling farm in Selinsgrove. Gemberling was educated at Friends Central School in Philadelphia before enrolling in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. 

In the late 1930s Gemberling married a well known Philadelphia architect, W. R. Morton Keast, and remained married to him until his death. Keast had two daughters by a prior marriage. He and Gemberling had no children. Keast was the chief designer for the architectural firm run by <a href="John%20T.%20Windrim">John T. Windrim</a>. In the 1920s and 1930s he designed a number of major buildings in Philadelphia including the <a href="Franklin%20Institute">Franklin Institute</a>, the Municipal Court Building, the Wannamaker's Men's Store (now known as <a href="One%20South%20Broad">One South Broad</a>, and the <a href="Wells%20Fargo%20Building%20%28Philadelphia%29">Fidelity Bank Building</a>. He was born in <a href="Germantown%2C%20Philadelphia">Germantown</a> in 1888 and died Bala Cynwyd in 1873.

From the late 1940s through the 1960s Gemberling was active in Philadelphia society.

Gemberling was an avid gardener and member of the Philadelphia Society of Little Gardens. She died on December 26, 1997, and was buried in the West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd.

Other names used

Gemberling's full name was Grace Thorp Gemberling. Thorp was her mother's maiden name; it is sometimes given as Thorpe. She commonly used Grace Gemberling prior to her marriage although sometimes she would use Grace T. Gemberling. The "New York Times" usually referred to her as Grace Thorp Gemberling. In addition to these name usages, following her marriage she was also called Grace Gemberling Keast, Grace Keast, Grace G. Keast, or Mrs. W. R. Morton Keast.

Roman tomb in Brestovik

Roman tomb in Brestovik () is an ancient tomb, dating from c. 300, which was discovered in 1895 in <a href="Brestovik">Brestovik</a>, today a suburban village of <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, the capital of <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. Though evidence points to the tomb of a wealthy local, popular belief is that the "martyrs of <a href="Singidunum">Singidunum</a>", Hermylus and Stratonicus, were buried inside. As one of the most important monuments from the Roman period, the tomb is protected since 1948.

Location.
The tomb is situated in the village of Brestovik in Belgrade's municipality of <a href="Grocka">Grocka</a>, on the locality of "Vukašinova crkva". It is dug into the hill of "Zlatno brdo" ("Golden hill").

Discovery and explorations.
The tomb was discovered by accident in 1895. The owner of the lot, Vukašin Milosavljević, was planting seedlings in his plum orchard, when he hit the arch of the vault with his <a href="spade">spade</a>. He notified the authorities and in September 1895 , the curator of the <a href="National%20Museum%20in%20Belgrade">National Museum in Belgrade</a> and founder of the archaeology in Serbia, was dispatched to the site. He conducted the excavations and uncovered the entire tomb. It was conserved and protected in 1905, while the excavations have been done in 1955 and 1964. In 1964 the tomb was adapted the way it looks today and was open for visitors as the stone stairway was built to make the access easier.

Characteristics.
The structure was built in the late 3rd or an early 4th century. It is partially dug into the slope of the hill on which the modern village cemetery is today. The tomb is oriented in the east-west direction with the entrance being on the eastern side. It is approached by an elongated, entry section, which is cut into the slope. The tomb was built from crushed stone, river pebble and bricks, all connected with the Roman <a href="lime%20plaster">lime plaster</a> made with volcanic sand, and itself consists of three rooms:




The porch and the central room are partially visible from above the ground, while the chamber is completely embedded into the hill. Later excavations in 1955 showed that the complex wasn't built at the same time. The burial chamber is the oldest while the rest was built later. Today, all the rooms are empty as sarcophagi and sculptures were taken away - some looted long time ago and some disappeared after the tomb was discovered.

It is the first discovered ancient multi-chambered tomb in Belgrade. Characteristics point to the Roman (pagan) sepulchral structure, which probably belonged to the wealthy family which had an estate and a villa in the vicinity, probably of a noble or a military commander. The disposition of the edifice and parts of the sculptures show the connection with the pagan <a href="heroon">heroon</a>s and shrines of the <a href="Imperial%20cult%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">Imperial cult</a>. Considering the tomb's elements and their relations, it marks the link between the Antiquity and early Christian buildings, a progenitor type from which the complex Christian structures of the burial cult developed. Within its period, it shows the connections with other Late Roman monuments, up to 6th century, on the territory of Serbia, but also much wider, on the Balkans and the Middle East. Closest analogy can be found with certain tombs discovered in Syria.

Valtrović described it as one of the "most precious monuments from the Antiquity, not only in Belgrade, but in Serbia". It was protected on 12 February 1948 as the cultural monument of great importance by the Institute for protection of the monuments (Decision No. 200/48), and was declared a cultural heritage of great importance by the state in 1979 ("Službeni glasnik Socijalističke Republike Srbije, No. 14/79").

Saint Hermylus and Stratonicus.
Roman emperors <a href="Constantine%20I%20the%20Great">Constantine I the Great</a> and <a href="Licinius">Licinius</a> signed the <a href="Edict%20of%20Milan">Edict of Milan</a> in 313 which made Christianity one of the official religions in the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. Licinius, who ruled in the east, soon clashed with Constantine so he outlawed the Christians again. According to the church <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a> from the 5th century, Hermylus, a Christian, was imprisoned and managed to convert one of his guards, Stratonicus. Licinius ordered for both of them to be tortured and drowned, so in the end they were put in one coffin and, still alive, thrown below the <a href="Belgrade%20Fortress">Singidunum Fortress</a> at the <a href="Sava">Sava</a>'s mouth into the Danube, in 314 or 315. The coffin was stranded on the shore 18 <a href="stadion%20%28unit%29">stadia</a> downstream, allegedly near modern Brestovik. Local Christians buried them in the brick tomb embedded into the hill. They were canonized by the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox Church</a> and their feast day is 26 January.

This prompted clerics and theologians to conclude that the Roman tomb in Brestovik is actually a tomb of Hermylus and Stratonicus. Experts didn't find anything that would point to the Christian tomb. Furthermore, one of two discovered sarcophagi in 1895 was a "female" one, and it was apparently a family tomb for a man, woman and a child. In addition, Brestovik is much further from Belgrade than 18 stadia (c. ).

Despite protests from the experts, institutions and the owners of the lot, local clergy and worshipers entered the tomb in 2014, bringing icons, candles and flowers, and holding services, which partially damaged the monument. As the tomb leans on modern cemetery, the church offered to the owners to buy the lot from them so that an entrance directly though the graveyard could be build, but they refused. Supported by several professors from the Faculty of Theology, the church considers the tomb an "early Christian church", that third, unknown person, was also buried with two saints, and that local population removed the remains from the sarcophagi so that advancing Huns or <a href="Pannonian%20Avars">Avars</a> wouldn't desecrate the tomb.

In 2016 local clergy started an initiative to build a church over the tomb. Serbian Orthodox Church again tried to buy the property from the current owners who again refused and the Institute for the protection of cultural monuments stated that the tomb is under protection and that nothing can't be built over it, regardless of the ownership, unless the Institute allows it. Church archaeologists claim that the saints were originally hastily buried in the Grocka's region of Dubočaj, a bit to the west, and then were reinterred to the new tomb in Brestovik when it was built. They claim that existence of the windows in the chamber prove that it was a room with <a href="relics">relics</a> and that one of the faint fresco figures is actually a Virgin Mary with Jesus, with two halos. Archaeologists disputed all this, saying that the image of Virgin Mary with Jesus was not yet used in that period and that absolutely everything discovered in the tomb shows that it is a "classical mausoleum of the high positioned member of an aristocratic family, [probably] an official or employee in the administration of <a href="Singidunum">Singidunum</a>". The municipality of Grocka granted the permit to the Serbian Orthodox Church to build a church in Brestovik, but not on the location of the tomb as they can't do it without the Institute's permission.

However, there are many stories among the local population about other tombs, still undiscovered, embedded into the hills, but no archaeological works have been done other than this locality. The entire area is actually a possible archaeological site with numerous embedded tombs. Only this one was preserved, which doesn't exclude the possibility that there are other, undiscovered ones.

As of July 2016, the Institute was drafting the project of repairing the tomb from the moist damage and conservation of the frescoes in the burial chamber.

Rachel Parent is a <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>-based <a href="Activism">activist</a> for healthy eating and issues related to <a href="genetically%20modified%20organisms">genetically modified organisms</a> (GMOs) in foods. She is the founder of Kids Right To Know, a non-profit organization that educates young people about making healthy and environmentally sound food choices, while explaining the need for the testing and labeling of <a href="genetically%20modified%20foods">genetically modified foods</a>. 

Introduction.
Parent's interest in genetically modified foods began when she was 11 years old. She was required to research material for a school project and chose the subject of GMOs. During her research, Parent noticed there was a lack of independent testing concerning the long-term risks of GMOs. She also found it troubling that Canada did not require food manufacturers to put labels on genetically modified foods.
The Lang and O'Leary Exchange.
On the May 27, 2013 episode of the CBC television program <a href="The%20Exchange%20%28TV%20series%29">"The Lang and O'Leary Exchange"</a>, <a href="Kevin%20O%27Leary">Kevin O'Leary</a> criticized protestors belonging to the <a href="March%20Against%20Monsanto">March Against Monsanto movement</a> by saying, "<a href="Monsanto">Monsanto</a> should be held up as a hero because they’ve developed technologies that help underdeveloped countries increase productivity by 5 and 10 times. You’re an ignorant and stupid person if you say what Monsanto does is bad for human beings."

After the program aired, Parent challenged O'Leary to a debate, saying, "I want to respond to Mr. Kevin O'Leary's idiotic statement about 'stupid' people who protest against Monsanto. I challenge you, Mr. O'Leary, to have me on your show next week, and if you promise not to use the word 'stupid,' then I won't use the word fascist."

On July 31st, Parent appeared for a ten-minute <a href="http%3A//www.cbc.ca/player/play/2398965483">interview</a> on the "Lang and O’Leary Exchange" to debate her position that <a href="Genetically%20modified%20food%20controversies%23Regulation">GMO labeling</a> should be mandatory and that GMOs should be independently tested. O'Leary asked Parent if she thought she was a <a href="Lobbying">lobbyist</a> for the anti-GMO movement. O'Leary also asked Parent if she was a '<a href="shill">shill</a>' for groups adding, "You’re young, you’re articulate, you’re getting lots of media, and I’m happy for you on that. But I’m trying to figure out whether you really deep down believe this."

Meeting with health minister.
On November 5, 2014 Parent met with the then <a href="Minister%20of%20Health%20%28Canada%29">Canadian Health Minister</a>, <a href="Rona%20Ambrose">Rona Ambrose</a>, to discuss labeling of GMO food. The brief 45-minute meeting was the result of <a href="Global%20News">Global News</a> asking Ambrose if she would agree to meet with Parent.

Activism.
Parent has given many radio, television and magazine interviews. She also gave a number of presentations at the 14th annual <a href="Planet%20in%20Focus">Planet In Focus Film Festival</a> Green Living Show, Total Health Show, <a href="TED%20%28conference%29">TedX Toronto</a>, Australia UpLift Festival and the Toronto Veg Fest

In 2014, Parent was named one of Toronto's Top 20 under-20s by "<a href="Post%20City%20Magazines">Post City Toronto</a>" magazine 

On June 30, 2016, Parent met with Canada's current Minister of Health, <a href="Jane%20Philpott">Jane Philpott</a>, to discuss GMOs and labeling. Dr. Philpott was presented with a list of international organizations supporting GMO labeling that included the Ontario Public Health Association, <a href="Canadian%20Association%20of%20Physicians%20for%20the%20Environment">Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment</a>, <a href="American%20Nurses%20Association">American Nurses Association</a> and the <a href="British%20Medical%20Association">British Medical Association</a>.

The Kartudjara's traditional lands extended over from "Madaleri", north of <a href="Lake%20Disappointment">Lake Disappointment</a> around <a href="Canning%20Stock%20Route">Well 22</a> down southwest towards "Pulpuruma" (Well 12).

History.
Around the 1890s the Kartudjara pressured the <a href="Niabali">Niabali</a> to their northwest ofF Savory Creek, forcing them to move roughly 60 miles to Balfour Downs.

Gonzalez Hontoria de 16 cm mod 1883

The Gonzalez Hontoria de 16 cm mod 1883 was a Spanish <a href="Naval%20artillery">naval gun</a> developed in the late 1800's that armed a variety of warships of the <a href="Spanish%20Navy">Spanish Navy</a> during the <a href="Spanish-American%20War">Spanish-American War</a>. 

History.
The Hontoria guns were designed by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20Hontoria">José González Hontoria</a> a Spanish inventor, field marshal of marine infantry and brigadier of the navy. During the 1800's Spain lagged behind other European powers in industrialization and Spain imported weapons from <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a>, <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> and <a href="Schneider%20et%20Cie">Schneider et Cie</a>. During the 1860's and 1870's, Hontoria studied explosives, metallurgy, and industrial production with the aim of developing an indigenous arms industry.

Construction.
In 1879 Hontoria designed a series of naval guns ranging from to which would lay the foundation for his later guns. The 1879 series like <a href="Ord%C3%B3%C3%B1ez%20guns">Ordóñez guns</a> of the same period were <a href="Glossary%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech loading</a>, <a href="black%20powder">black powder</a>, <a href="Built-up%20gun">built up guns</a>, with steel A tube and <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> reinforcing <a href="hoop%20gun">hoops</a>. The 1883 series was a step forward in that they were breech loading, built up guns, with <a href="Forging">forged steel</a> A tube and forged steel reinforcing hoops. The Hontoria 1883 series ranged in size from to and were 35 calibers in length. They were produced by the <a href="Arsenal%20de%20la%20Carraca">Arsenal de la Carraca</a> in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cadiz</a> and the Royal Ordnance Works at Trubia in <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a>.

Criticisms of the 1883 series guns:

Naval Use.
16 cm Hontoria 1883 guns armed a variety of ships such as <a href="Ironclad%20warship">ironclads</a> and <a href="unprotected%20cruisers">unprotected cruisers</a> of the Spanish Navy.

Deimantas Narkevičius

Deimantas Narkevičius (born in <a href="Utena">Utena</a>, <a href="Lithuanian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Lithuanian SSR</a> in 1964) is a Lithuanian filmmaker and artist, who lives and works in <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>.

Film career.
Narkevičius graduated from the Art Academy in Vilnius as a sculptor, having spent a year in London in 1992-93. He was concerned site-specific objects and the newly independent <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>'s political history at a time when the removal of Soviet monuments (and particularly was making international headlines, but his interest in narrative and cultural memory led him to record interviews and conversations with artists, and then into artists' film and video.

His films deal extensively with the cultural legacy of Communism, and attempts to erase it after the fall of the Warsaw Pact regimes in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union two years later, with an emphasis on statues, sculptors, artists and moving images. The themes were developed through his early features and shorts, including "Europa, 54° 54' - 25° 19"' (1997), "Legend Coming True" (1999), and "Energy Lithuania" (2000).

In 2001, Narkevičius represented Lithuania at the <a href="Venice%20Biennale">49th Venice Bienniale</a>. He also exhibited in the 50th, two years later, in the 'Utopia Station' curated by <a href="Molly%20Nesbit">Molly Nesbit</a> and <a href="Hans-Ulrich%20Obrist">Hans Ulrich Obrist</a>. Describing his work's relationship with his nation's past in an interview with Obrist, Narkevičius said that, “Memory is a funny thing. I think our brain has a filter: you remember what you want to remember. And you recreate the stories of the memory in a way that you want to remember them and how you would like to create them.”

In "The Role of a Lifetime" (2003), commissioned by Brighton & Hove's <a href="Art%20and%20Sacred%20Places">Art and Sacred Places</a>, Narkevičius asked what it meant to be a filmmaker with a social conscience. He placed an interview with British director <a href="Peter%20Watkins">Peter Watkins</a> - whose politically-charged, fictionalised documentary-style works had addressed the <a href="Hungarian%20Uprising%20of%201956">Hungarian uprising</a>, the battle of <a href="Culloden%20%28film%29">Culloden</a>, and the <a href="La%20Commune%20%28Paris%2C%201871%29">Commune of Paris 1871</a>, and who had left the UK in frustration at censorship and neglect and living in Vilnius - over 1960s Super-8 footage of <a href="Brighton%20and%20Hove">Brighton & Hove</a>, and sketches by Lithuanian artist Mindaugas Lukosaitis of <a href="Gr%C5%ABtas%20Park">Grūtas Park,</a> the sculpture garden 80 miles south of Vilnius where many of the country's momuments ended up. Noting that some people considered the decision to save the statues "a disaster", Watkins described the park as a place to contemplate "man's unbelievable folly and inhumanity ... and sadly, the endless repetition of history."

His next film, "Once in the XX Century" (2004) played with the Lithuanian television footage, broadcast across the world, of the Lenin statue in <a href="Luki%C5%A1k%C4%97s%20Square">Lukiškės Square</a> being torn down in 1991. Recutting it in reverse, Narkevičius showed a jubilant crowd cheering the monument as it was hoisted from the back of a vehicle onto a plinth, being reunited with its legs, commenting on 'a moment of breakage in the country's history' in which 'dramatic political "[moments]" reveal an unnervingly undefined limbo'.

"The Head" (2007) consisted entirely of photographs and archive footage, made for <a href="East%20Germany">East German</a> television, documenting the creation of the world's second-largest head sculpture - a seven-metre-high <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> by Soviet <a href="Socialist%20realism">socialist realist</a> artist <a href="Lev%20Kerbel">Lev Kerbel</a> (1917-2003) - from its conception in 1968 to its unveiling in <a href="Chemnitz">Karl-Marx Stadt (now Chemnitz)</a> in 1971. Of "The Head," which also used footage of East German children talking about their role models, Narkevičius said: "Objects from that period are not a crime. They are rather testimonies to historical crimes, visual heritage of an era to be kept and appreciated: if we want to feel any compassion for what the people who lived then lost, and in order to separate individuals from their creatively inhibited artworks - even if the consequences of this aesthetical repression can still be felt in the Eastern Bloc ..."

In "Revisiting Solaris" (2007), Narkevičius filmed the final chapter of <a href="Solaris%20%28novel%29">Stanisław Lem's novel</a>, left out of <a href="Andrei%20Tarkovsky">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>'s 1972 <a href="Solaris%20%281972%20film%29">adaptation</a>, with Lithuanian actor <a href="Donatas%20Banionis">Dionatas Banionis</a> reprising his role as Kris Kelvin, reflecting on his brief time on the surface of Solaris before returning to Earth. He also re-used <a href="Eduard%20Artemyev">Eduard Artemyev</a>'s iconic soundtrack, using a series of photographs taken by Lithuanian Symbolist artist <a href="Mikolajus%20%C4%8Ciurlionis">Mikolajus Čiurlionis</a> in <a href="Anapa">Anapa</a> in 1905 to represent the planet, but he played up Lem's critique of the effects of electronic media on human relations, a theme less prominent in Tarkovsky's film but deeply relevant to Narkevičius' time.

In 2008, he won both the <a href="Lithuanian%20National%20Culture%20and%20Art%20Prize">Lithuanian National Culture and Art Prize</a>, and the <a href="The%20Vincent%20Award">Vincent Award</a> at the <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh%20Biennial%20Award%20for%20Contemporary%20Art%20in%20Europe">Vincent van Gogh Biennial Award for Contemporary Art in Europe</a>.

"Restricted Sensation" (2011) was a 45-minute feature film depicting the abuse of a talented young gay theatre director in the Lithuanian SSR in the 1970s, with the post-Stalinist re-criminalisation of homosexuality representing the oppressive cultural policy that took hold as <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a> assumed total power in the late 1920s. Narkevičius said he was not aiming to depict the explicit, illegal life of gays in the Soviet Union, although it can be read as a comment both on that period's homophobia and <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Russia">Vladimir Putin's persecution of Russia's LGBTQI population</a>; rather, the film comments on 'the distrust and intolerance of what is perceived as foreign to a particular country's culture' and was 'an attempt to identify the causes of the increasing prevalence of intolerance'.

His most recent work, "20.July 2015" (2016)"," traces the removal of several socialist realist sculptures from the Green Bridge in central Vilnius, that had been erected in 1952. Presented in immersive 3D - his first use of the medium - it culminates in the final removal of the monuments at 2am on 20 July 2015.
