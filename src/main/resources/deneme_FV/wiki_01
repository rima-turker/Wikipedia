Mark Lorimer

Mark Lorimer is a British dancer / choreographer best known for his work with the Brussels-based choreographers <a href="Anne%20Teresa%20De%20Keersmaeker">Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Hauert">Thomas Hauert</a>.

Training and start as a dancer.
Mark Lorimer was a student at the <a href="London%20Contemporary%20Dance%20School">London Contemporary Dance School</a>, and graduated in 1991. After that, he joined the dance company <a href="The%20Featherstonehaughs">The Featherstonehaughs</a> (a sister company of <a href="The%20Cholmondeleys">The Cholmondeleys</a>) of choreographer <a href="Lea%20Anderson">Lea Anderson</a>. Until 1993, he worked with them on various stage art projects, but also on films, local projects and an adaptation of <a href="Pier%20Paolo%20Pasolini">Pasolini's</a> <a href="Teorema%20%28film%29">"Teorema"</a> with theater and opera director <a href="Lucy%20Bailey">Lucy Bailey</a>. In 1993, he moved to Brussels to work with the Compagnie Michèle Anne De Mey on "Pulcinella", a dance production with a live version of the "Italian Suite" from <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky's</a> "Pulcinella".

Collaboration with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas.
His most important (and longest) collaboration, however, was the one he started with <a href="Anne%20Teresa%20De%20Keersmaeker">Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker</a> / Rosas in 1994. From "Amor constante, más allá de la muerte" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 1994) to "En Atendant" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 2010) he danced in ten new productions. He also performed in restagings of "Bartók / Mikrokosmos" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 1987), "Kinok" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 1994) and "Mozart / Concert Arias. Unmoto di gioia." (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 1992), and was a repetitor on "In real time" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, TG Stan and <a href="Aka%20Moon">AKA Moon</a>, 2000) and "Vortex Temporum" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 2013). In 2009, Mark Lorimer, with Rosas dancer Cynthia Loemij, also performed a choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker on "Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune" by <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a> for the film "Prelude à la Mer" by <a href="Thierry%20De%20Mey">Thierry De Mey</a>.

Collaboration with Thomas Hauert / ZOO.
Another important collaboration of Mark Lorimer was that between 1997 and 2005 with <a href="Thomas%20Hauert">Thomas Hauert</a> / ZOO. He danced in six new productions of the dance company, from "Cows in Space" (Thomas Hauert / ZOO, 1998) to "Modify" (Thomas Hauert / ZOO, 2004). For "5" (Thomas Hauert, Mark Lorimer, <a href="Sara%20Ludi">Sara Ludi</a>, <a href="Samantha%20van%20Wissen">Samantha van Wissen</a> and Mat Voorter / ZOO, 2003) the various then core members of the company created their own choreographies. For Mark Lorimer, that was "Nylon solution", a collaboration with Chrysa Parkinson.

Own choreographies.
In addition to "Nylon solution", Mark Lorimer has created some other own choreographies. Based on a duet with Cynthia Loemij, Mark Lorimer made the video installation "Mirror Modulation" for the exhibition "The Time That Is Left" by artist <a href="Manon%20de%20Boer">Manon de Boer</a> at the Frankfurter Kunstverein. His best known choreographies are the two choreographies he created with Cynthia Loemij: "Dancesmith - Camel, Wheat, Whale" (Cynthia Loemij and Mark Lorimer, 2013) and "To Intimate" (Cynthia Loemij and Mark Lorimer, 2011). These productions toured in Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Switzerland. He created "To Intimate" (Cynthia Loemij and Mark Lorimer, 2011) for Ovaal vzw, a Brussels dance organization he founded together with Cynthia Loemij. His most recent choreography is "Darwin's Gypsy Dance" (Mark Lorimer, 2016), that he created for five members of BODHI PROJECT, a dance company for postgraduate students at SEAD, the Salzburg Experimental Academy of Dance.

Collaboration with others.
In addition, Mark Lorimer also collaborated as a dancer with other choreographers: Bock and Vincenzi, Mia Lawrence, <a href="Jonathan%20Burrows">Jonathan Burrows</a>, <a href="Deborah%20Hay">Deborah Hay</a>, Alix Eynaudi and Boris Charmatz.

Work as a teacher.
Mark Lorimer also regularly teaches at <a href="P.A.R.T.S.">P.A.R.T.S.</a> (Brussels), ImPulsTanz - Vienna International Dance Festival (Vienna), <a href="Trinity_Laban_Conservatoire_of_Music_and_Dance">The Laban Centre</a> (London), <a href="London%20Contemporary%20Dance%20School">London Contemporary Dance School</a>, Panetta Movement Center (New York), <a href="Movement%20Research">Movement Research</a> (New York) and Manufacture (Lausanne).

Thomas Abernethy (explorer)

Thomas Abernethy (1803–1860) was a Scottish seafarer, <a href="gunner%20%28rank%29">gunner</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, and polar explorer. Because he was neither an officer nor a gentleman he was little mentioned in the books written by the leaders of the expeditions he went on, but what was said was very praising and he was awarded five <a href="Arctic%20Medal">Arctic Medal</a>s. He was in parties that, for their time, reached the furthest north, the furthest south (twice), and the nearest to the <a href="South%20Magnetic%20Pole">South Magnetic Pole</a>. In 1831, along with <a href="James%20Clark%20Ross">James Clark Ross</a>'s team of six, Abernethy was in the first party ever to reach the <a href="North%20Magnetic%20Pole">North Magnetic Pole</a>.

Early and personal life.
Thomas Abernethy was born in 1803 at <a href="Longside">Longside</a> in northeast Scotland and while he was a child his family moved to the nearby port of <a href="Peterhead">Peterhead</a>. His parents were James Abernethy, a stonemason, and Isabella Robertson. Thomas had an elder sister, Ann, born 1801, and twin brothers, James and William, born 1816. When Thomas was about twelve he was apprenticed as a merchant seaman on the <a href="sloop">sloop</a> "Friends" and it is known he travelled to the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> and twice to <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>. In 1819 he became a greenhand on the <a href="maiden%20voyage">maiden voyage</a> of the Peterhead whaling ship "Hannibal" which hunted <a href="bowhead%20whale">bowhead whale</a>s around <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> and in its third season it sailed into the <a href="Davis%20Strait">Davis Strait</a> on the western coast of Greenland where ice conditions can be much heavier. Abernethy married Barbara Fiddes, daughter of a ship's carpenter, in 1829 and they lived at <a href="Deptford">Deptford</a>, southeast London, near the <a href="Deptford%20Dockyard">Royal Naval docks</a>. They had no children.

Abernethy was nearly six feet tall and well built – there are no known photographs or portraits of him. He had dark hair and a ruddy complexion. In 1829 <a href="John%20Ross%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Ross</a> described him as "decidedly the best-looking man in the ship" and he thought that men of his appearance were best able to endure cold. <a href="Clements%20Markham">Clements Markham</a> described him as "a handsome man with a well-knit frame, and was resourceful and thoroughly reliable".

Arctic with Parry, 1824–1827.
Northwest Passage.
Sir <a href="William%20Parry%20%28explorer%29">William Parry</a> became famous for many Arctic naval expeditions, particularly in trying to discover a route for a <a href="Northwest%20Passage">Northwest Passage</a> through the <a href="Canadian%20Arctic%20Archipelago">Canadian Arctic Archipelago</a>.
For his third attempt, in 1824 Parry took the vessels "<a href="HMS%20Fury%20%281814%29">HMS Fury</a>", under <a href="Henry%20Parkyns%20Hoppner">Henry Hoppner</a>, and "<a href="HMS%20Hecla%20%281815%29">HMS Hecla</a>" with Parry himself in command and Abernethy signed on as one of the 75-strong "Hecla" crew. He was an <a href="able%20seaman">able seaman</a>, just one rank above <a href="ordinary%20seaman">ordinary seaman</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Leaving London in May 1824, the expedition reached <a href="Lancaster%20Sound">Lancaster Sound</a> but ice meant they had to winter at the <a href="Brodeur%20Peninsula">Brodeur Peninsula</a> in the northwest part of <a href="Baffin%20Island">Baffin Island</a>. Several shore parties explored the region but there is no record of Abernethy's involvement. When free of ice they voyaged down Prince Regent Inlet but "Fury" became wrecked (at Fury Beach) and "Hecla",
with both crews, returned to London in October 1825. Abernethy was paid off and left the navy to again become a merchant seaman. Very belatedly, in 1857, he was awarded an <a href="Arctic%20Medal">Arctic Medal</a> for his service.

North Pole.
In 1827 Parry again took "<a href="HMS%20Hecla%20%281815%29">HMS Hecla</a>" this time in an attempt to reach the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a> using small boats and sledges. Second in command was <a href="James%20Clark%20Ross">James Clark Ross</a>
and assistant surgeon was <a href="Robert%20McCormick%20%28explorer%29">Robert McCormick</a>. Abernethy took part, now promoted to the rank of <a href="petty%20officer">gunnery petty officer</a>. Departing London in March 1827 they sailed to <a href="Spitsbergen">Spitsbergen</a> where they found a safe anchorage at Sorgfjord, <a href="Ny-Friesland">Ny-Friesland</a> in the far north. Abernethy participated in the expedition north but, beset by difficulties they turned back at 82° 45' N – a record for furthest north that stood for almost fifty years. On the expedition's return Abernethy was enlisted in the Royal Navy on a permanent basis and eventually received his second Arctic Medal.

Arctic, with John Ross, 1829–1833.
Northwest Passage.
In 1829, Sir <a href="John%20Ross%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Ross</a> led another Northwest Passage expedition and appointed Abernethy to join the crew of "Victory", a sailing ship and steam paddle steamer of 30 <a href="horsepower">horsepower</a>. <a href="James%20Clark%20Ross">James Clark Ross</a>, Ross's nephew, was second-in-command. By October they had reached <a href="Prince%20Regent%20Inlet">Prince Regent Inlet</a> and then far south into the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Boothia">Gulf of Boothia</a> where they anchored for the winter at Felix Harbour.
They formed good relations with the local <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> who drew knowledgable maps of the region which showed that there was no seaway to the west from where they were, or any further south in the Gulf although there was a narrow strait to the north (<a href="Bellot%20Strait">Bellot Strait</a>). Following the guidance of the Inuit they experimented with dog sledges and were able to cross the <a href="Boothia%20Peninsula">Boothia Peninsula</a>. A small party led by James Ross, including Abernethy, explored northwards but were unable to locate Bellot Strait. Again James Ross chose Abernethy for a westward expedition starting on 17 May 1830, crossing the Boothia Peninsula and the sea ice of <a href="James%20Ross%20Strait">James Ross Strait</a> to <a href="King%20William%20Island">King William Island</a>, reaching a point at the north of the island which Ross named after Abernethy. They went a way down the northwest coast of the island and then, 200 miles in a direct line from their ship, they returned on 13 June – after a journey of one month they looked like "human skeletons". Abernethy was on another sledging expedition to the south confirming that there was no way out from the Gulf of Boothia in that direction. Only by September could "Victory" head north but they only got a few miles before they were frozen in again for the next winter.

North Magnetic Pole.
On 15 May 1831 Abernethy was on James Ross's team of six which attempted to reach the <a href="North%20Magnetic%20Pole">North Magnetic Pole</a>. They were equipped with a <a href="dip%20circle">dip circle</a> and on 1 July they reached where the angle of dip was 89°59'. For two days they retested using different observers at slightly different locations attaining an average 89°59'28" so discovering a slight daily change in the position of the magnetic pole. This was the first time the magnetic pole had been reached and, inevitably, they erected the Union Jack. Ross decided to explore a few miles further north before turning back so he chose Abernethy as his sole companion. On returning to the ship Ross named an island they passed after Abernethy. In 21 days they had travelled about 300 miles and the map they had been able to draw remained the standard for over 100 years.

By late August 1831 "Victory" was free of ice but immediately became trapped again. Through the winter they hunted for food – as well as catching seals Abernethy was good at shooting hares and grouse so becoming called "the gamekeeper". By May 1832 they realised there was little hope of the ship becoming free of the ice that year so they left "Victory" using their own small boats/sledges hoping to find "Fury"'s boats, abandoned by Parry in 1825.

Return home.
A three-strong advance party, including Abernethy, located the scene of "Fury"s wreckage and the entire expedition was able to use the stores and boats left there and build a substantial shelter, "Somerset House". In July Prince Regent Inlet cleared of ice but by August they found Lancaster Sound completely blocked so they had to return to Fury Beach for the next winter in Somerset House. On 14 August 1833 Abernethy spotted an open lead in the sea ice and so they set off rowing at 4:00 next morning, eventually reaching Cape York (the cape at the northwest point of the Brodeur Peninsula). At <a href="Navy%20Board%20Inlet">Navy Board Inlet</a>, after a spell of 20 hours continuous rowing, a distant sail was spotted so the men rowed on but the ship sailed out of reach. They then spotted a second ship, also sailing away, but they were spotted and rescued by the <a href="Port%20of%20Hull">Hull</a> whaler "Isabella". The captain told them they had been given up for dead two years previously "not by them alone, but by all England". By the time they reached Hull, where they received a civic reception, they had been away for four years and 149 days – Abernethy was paid £329:14:8d in back pay at double rates. He was later awarded his third Arctic Medal. John Ross wrote of Abernethy "I have no hesitation in recommending him strongly to the Admiralty ..." so they promoted him to HMS Seringapatam. By now James Ross regarded him as an essential member of any future expedition.

Antarctica with James Ross, 1839–1843.
Ross Sea, 1839–1841.
With <a href="James%20Clark%20Ross">James Ross</a> in command of the ships "<a href="HMS%20Erebus%20%281826%29">HMS Erebus</a>" and "<a href="HMS%20Terror%20%281813%29">HMS Terror</a>", three-mast <a href="barque">barque</a>s, Abernethy set off on a scientific expedition to <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> in 1839, supported by the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>. <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>, later Sir Joseph but then a young naturalist, took part but because it was a naval expedition he had to be appointed as assistant surgeon. Throughout the expedition a major aim was to take magnetic readings at various ports of call starting with <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a>, <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>, <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, <a href="St%20Helena">St Helena</a>, <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, and the <a href="Crozet%20Islands">Crozet</a> and <a href="Kerguelen%20Islands">Kerguelen</a> islands. In a storm the <a href="boatswain">boatswain</a> was swept off "Erebus" so two boats were launched to rescue him, unsuccessfully. Abernethy was in command of one boat but, just as it got back to "Erebus", the other boat was hit by a wave and all four crew were washed overboard. Abernethy cast off again and was able to rescue them.

When they reached <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a> they learned that the <a href="United%20States%20Exploring%20Expedition">Wilkes expedition</a> and <a href="Jules%20Dumont%20d%27Urville%23The%20second%20voyage%20of%20Astrolabe">D'Urville expedition</a> had already sighted Antarctica so Ross decided to explore a different unknown region. <a href="Robert%20McCormick%20%28explorer%29">McCormick</a> (from Parry's north polar days) who was ships' surgeon and Abernethy became close associates – and in New Zealand the pair collected natural history specimens. Ross chose 170°E as the longitude to follow south and this turned out to be the future usual route for Antarctic voyages. The ships headed into what became known as the <a href="Ross%20Sea">Ross Sea</a> reaching <a href="pack%20ice">pack ice</a> at 66°55'S in January 1840 – they then forced their way into the pack ice, the first time this had been attempted. <a href="Raoul%20Amundsen">Amundsen</a> wrote "Few people of the present day are capable of rightly appreciating this heroic deed, this brilliant proof of human courage and energy ... These men were heroes ...", and <a href="Robert%20Falcon%20Scott">Scott</a> wrote "... all must concede that it deserves to rank among the most brilliant and famous [Antarctic expeditions] that have been made. ... few things could have looked more hopeless than an attack upon the great ice-bound region" They then emerged into open sea at 69°15'S and, sailing further south hoping to reach the <a href="South%20Magnetic%20Pole">South Magnetic Pole</a>, they spotted land and mountains which they named <a href="Victoria%20Land">Victoria Land</a> and the <a href="Admiralty%20Range">Admiralty Range</a>, and cleared <a href="Cape%20Adare">Cape Adare</a>. With Abernethy as coxswain their first boat reached a coastal island, <a href="Possession%20Islands">Possession Island</a>, but they did not reach the Antarctic mainland. Onward, they crossed the latitude of <a href="James%20Weddell">Weddel</a>'s record of furthest south and landed on <a href="Franklin%20Island%20%28Antarctica%29">Franklin Island</a>. 

Soon, in the distance, they spotted what McCormick described as "a stupendous volcanic mountain in a high state of activity" and, getting closer, "a dense column of black smoke, intermingled with flashes of red flame". Hooker wrote of "a sight so surpassing everything that can be imagined". Ross named it <a href="Mount%20Erebus">Mount Erebus</a>, after his ship and the nearby mountain became <a href="Mount%20Terror%20%28Antarctica%29">Mount Terror</a>.
Sailing east they reached a 200-foot ice cliff which they called the Great Southern Barrier, now the <a href="Ross%20Ice%20Shelf">Ross Ice Shelf</a>, and followed it so reaching 78°4'S. By depth sounding adjacent to the ice they determined the ice was floating and was therefore 1000 feet thick. At a low point in the ice cliffs they could see from the masthead "an enormous plain of frosted silver" and they were certain there was no open sea further south. After following the barrier for over 250 miles and with the Antarctic winter approaching they returned to the west but, near Mount Erebus, could not get ashore. They were 160 miles from the south magnetic pole – 700 miles nearer than anyone had been before. After passing Cape Adare, they again succeeded in breaking through the pack ice and reached <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> on 6 April 1841 to be greeted by <a href="John%20Franklin">John Franklin</a> and crowds of well-wishers. As is happens "Erebus" and "Terror" were the last vessels to navigate the Ross Sea using only sail.

Weddell Sea, 1841–1843.
For more magnetic readings, they left for <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> in July 1841 continuing to New Zealand's <a href="Bay%20of%20Islands">Bay of Islands</a>. In November they set sail south,
this time heading south along 146°W hoping to again reach the Ross Ice Shelf. This time they became trapped in the pack ice and it took 58 days to reach through 800 miles of pack to open water. They sighted what became <a href="Edward%20VII%20Land">Edward VII Land</a> and, reaching their new furthest south of 78°9'S, they again saw the Ice Shelf. With the sea beginning to freeze solid, Ross headed north and set course for the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>. The two ships became pinched between two barrier icebergs and collided several times with both ships severely damaged and facing capsize. "Terror" managed to sail clear but "Erebus" was trapped with the only means of to escape being to "stern board" (sailing stern first) with Abernethy as ice-master. Abernethy "one of the most experienced icemen of our day – ever vigilant and on the watch" was able to guide them through a gap hardly wider than the ship. At last, after rounding <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, they reached <a href="East%20Falkland">East Falkland</a> in April 1842 and refitted the ships. For more magnetic readings they sailed for <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, arriving in September but it was too early in the season to head south again so they took extended readings and then returned to the Falkland Islands, setting off on 17 December down 55°W aiming to reach the Antarctic coast at 40°W through the <a href="Weddell%20Sea">Weddell Sea</a>. This time they failed to penetrate any distance into the pack ice so they retreated, heading for the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> arriving in April 1843, and sailing home via <a href="St%20Helena">St Helena</a>, <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension Island</a> and <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. They arrived back in England on 23 September 1843, after which Abernethy has been briefly lost to history.

Searches for John Franklin's lost expedition party.
With James Ross, 1845–1849.
In 1845 Sir <a href="John%20Franklin">John Franklin</a> commanded an expedition along with <a href="Francis%20Crozier">Francis Crozier</a> who had been on Ross's Antarctic expedition, again using "Erebus" and "Terror", and again trying to find a Northwest Passage. In what became known as <a href="Franklin%27s%20lost%20expedition">Franklin's lost expedition</a>, both ships were eventually lost and 129 men were to die but Abernethy had not been included in the vast crew. By 1847 fears developed over what had happened so in 1848 three expeditions set off to search for Franklin, the main one commanded by <a href="James%20Clark%20Ross">James Ross</a> in "<a href="HMS%20Enterprise%20%281848%29">HMS Enterprise</a>", with <a href="Robert%20McClure">Robert McClure</a>, <a href="Francis%20McClintock">Francis McClintock</a> and Abernethy as icemaster; and "<a href="HMS%20Investigator%20%281848%29">HMS Investigator</a>". The ships were accompanied by steam <a href="pinnace%20%28ship%27s%20boat%29">pinnace</a>s.The ice was exceptionally bad in Lancaster Sound but they were able to winter at <a href="Port%20Leopold">Port Leopold</a>. Early next season they carefully checked in <a href="Peel%20Sound">Peel Sound</a> by sledge, not realising this had actually been Franklin's route, and returned to "Enterprise" after 500 miles and 39 days. Ross presumed Franklin had got beyond <a href="Melville%20Island%20%28Northwest%20Territories%20and%20Nunavut%29">Melville Island</a> from where he would try and escape south to a region covered by one of the other search expeditions. Only by 28 August 1849 after they had sawed a two-mile canal could their ship be freed from the ice but to the west they found continuous ice. Although trapped, the ships drifted east for 250 miles at about 10 miles per day from where, starting on 24 September, they headed home.

With John Ross, 1850–1851.
The <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> offered rewards for finding (or even hearing news of) Franklin so 
the 73-year-old <a href="John%20Ross%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Ross</a> set off with "Felix", a steam <a href="schooner">schooner</a>, with Abernethy as <a href="Master%20%28naval%29">master</a> of the vessel.
At this time he was describing Abernethy as "my old shipmate". Ross sought Abernethy's advice about crew which led to many of Abernethy's relatives being signed on.
"Felix" left <a href="Ayr">Ayr</a> on 20 May 1850 but at <a href="Loch%20Ryan">Loch Ryan</a> in a near mutiny many of the crew had gone ashore and got drunk so Ross had to leave eight of them behind,
including Abernethy himself. A letter from Ross to the <a href="Hudson%20Bay%20Company">Hudson Bay Company</a>
and a report in the "Shipping Gazette" were bitterly critical of Abernethy,
blaming him for instigating the whole thing. All the same, "Felix" set sail with Abernethy again on board. 
Meeting other search ships off <a href="Cape%20York%20%28Greenland%29">Cape York</a> (the cape on the northwest coast of Greenland), it was found that translations of different local Inuit accounts variously said that nearby Franklin's party had not been seen at all or that everyone had been murdered. At the later official Admiralty Board of Enquiry Abernethy said he had never believed the murder story. Ross credited Abernethy and Charles Phillips with finding the graves of three of Franklin's men near the shore of <a href="Beechey%20Island">Beechey Island</a> at the entrance to <a href="Wellington%20Channel">Wellington Channel</a> although Phillips later said he had been called to the scene. Ross wintered on <a href="Cornwallis%20Island%20%28Nunavut%29">Cornwallis Island</a> and next year searched the island and Wellington Channel. Again Ross found Abernethy drunk and his spirit allowance was stopped – later in an open letter to the "Nautical Standard and Steam Navigation Gazette" Ross said he had lost all confidence in Abernethy due to his insubordination and intemperance. In August 1851 when the ice melted they returned home with Ross saying "we parted good friends at last". Abernethy was awarded his fourth Arctic Medal.

With Edward Inglefield, 1852.
In 1852, succumbing to public pressure, the Admiralty dispatched five search vessels on a new expedition and <a href="Jane%20Franklin">Lady Franklin</a> funded a sixth vessel, her own steam yacht "<a href="Auxiliary%20Steamship%20Isabel%20%281850%29">Isabel</a>", a two-masted <a href="brigantine">brigantine</a>, under <a href="Edward%20Augustus%20Inglefield">Edward Inglefield</a>. Abernethy was ice master and second in command of "Isabel". Contrary to instructions Inglefield explored around <a href="Baffin%20Bay">Baffin Bay</a> and reached <a href="Wolstenholme%20Bay">Wolstenholme Bay</a>, near <a href="Cape%20York%20%28Greenland%29">Cape York</a>, where Franklin and his men had supposedly been murdered. However, they found nothing suspicious buried in the cairn that had been said to be their burial place. 
Sailing on north they reached <a href="Smith%20Sound">Smith Sound</a> and discovered it provided a hitherto unknown entrance to the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>. On 29 August, with a heavy swell, thick fog, and ice forming, on Abernethy's advice that they only had four or five days before they would be trapped, they turned to the south and reached <a href="Beechey%20Island">Beechey Island</a> to leave surplus stores for the ships there. They left earlier on the same day that McCormick arrived – in his book McCormick wrote of his disappointment about having missed his "old shipmate and friend at both the Poles, Abernethy." After surviving severe storms they abandoned the thought of overwintering and in ferocious weather returned home in November 1852 for Abernethy's fifth and last Arctic Medal.

Death, assessments and legacy.
For most of Abernethy's married life he had been away at sea. In 1854 his wife Barbara died, aged 44, with her husband at her side, and Abernethy returned to live in Peterhead. In 1857 he married Rebecca Young but he was only to live for another three years. He died of "ulcersation of the stomach" on 13 April 1860 and his wife erected a gravestone in Peterhead Old Kirkyard. The local newspaper carried a very brief death notice.

According to Alex Buchan, Abernethy's biographer, in the 19th century Naval officers were almost always from the landed gentry and they had purchased their commissions. Certain of their superiority, they wrote accounts of their expeditions keeping the credit for themselves. Indeed, at the end of an expedition, commanders often required any records kept by the crew to be given to them for inclusion at their discretion in the official report. Possibly because of this Abernethy left no written records. According to <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">SirJoseph Hooker</a>, a distinguished scientist, concerning crewmen, "And where have you seen or heard that their services are in the least appreciated? The Admiralty have not as much as sent a letter of thanks to the men". 

Although Abernethy has largely disappeared from history his contributions were sufficiently outstanding for accounts to have been left of him, even though he was neither an officer nor a gentleman. <a href="Clements%20Markham">Sir Clements Markham</a>, who had been president of the <a href="Royal%20Geographical%20Society">Royal Geographical Society</a> and who had known Abernethy well, wrote in 1921 "The gunner of the "Erebus" must not be left out, as he was a very exceptional character and had very wide Arctic experience ... Abernethy was a splendid seaman". In 1828 Sir John Ross had described him as "the most steady and active, as well as the most powerful man in the ship".

Three capes were named after Abernethy: in <a href="Wolstenholme%20Fjord">Wolstenholme Fjord</a> in <a href="Baffin%20Bay">Baffin Bay</a>, on <a href="King%20William%20Island">King William Island</a>, and on an island west of <a href="Ellesmere%20Island">Ellesmere Island</a>. In 1983 <a href="Abernethy%20Flats">Abernethy Flats</a> on <a href="James%20Ross%20Island">James Ross Island</a> was also given his name. His gravestone still stands and in 2016 his biography was published.

North East Asian Mathematics Competition

The North East Asian Mathematics Competition (NEAMC) is a three-day mathematics competition held in a predesignated location in North East Asia.

It is a qualifying competition by Competition Academy for invitation to the World Mathematics Championships.

General information.
Location.
The location of the NEAMC changes annually. There are now at least two venues held annually and any institution may host it (with significant discounted perks).

Eligibility.
The Senior Competition is open to all students in Grade 12 (Year 13) or younger during the month of the event.

The Junior Competition is open to all students in Grade 9 (Year 10) or younger during the month of the event.

The competition.
History.
SEAMC and NEAMC are three-day events for school students located in South East and North East Asia, respectively. Participants work alone and in teams, as well as listen to mathematician guest speakers.

SEAMC was conceived at the turn of the millennium by Steve Warry, a teacher at <a href="Alice%20Smith%20School">Alice Smith School</a> in Kuala Lumpur who believed that mathematics could be a spectator sport. In pursuit of this, he organised the South East Asian Mathematics Competition (SEAMC) for March 2001, although he died a week prior to the competition. NEAMC was organised in February 2014 by Malcolm Coad of <a href="Nanjing%20International%20School">Nanjing International School</a>, China as a parallel event to SEAMC.

Format.
SEAMC, NEAMC and all other WMC qualifying competitions have:

School teams engage within the Communication skills rounds.

The Collaboration skills rounds are in buddy teams of three (the Open round involves 2 buddy teams working together).
The Challenge are skills rounds undertaken as individuals.

Three skills rounds are (subject specific skills and procedures) knowledge based,
three are (plan and execute) strategy focused and three depend upon (new and imaginative ideas) creativity.

So each strategy, creative and knowledge skill category is engaged in alone, in school teams and in buddy teams.

Background.
<a href="The%20Boat%20Race">The Boat Race</a> is a <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29%23Side%20by%20side">side-by-side rowing</a> competition between the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). First held in 1829, the race takes place on the <a href="The%20Championship%20Course">Championship Course</a>, between <a href="Putney">Putney</a> and <a href="Mortlake">Mortlake</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> in south-west London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Oxford went into the race as champions, having won the <a href="The%20Boat%20Races%202017">2017 race</a> by a margin of one and a quarter lengths, with Camridge leading overall with 82 victories to Oxford's 80 (excluding the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201877">1877 race</a>, officially a dead heat though claimed as a victory by the Oxford crew).

It will be the third time in the history of The Boat Race that all four senior races – the men's, women's, men's reserves' and women's reserves' – were held on the same day and on the same course along the <a href="Tideway">Tideway</a>. Prior to 2015, the women's race, which <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race%201927">first took place in 1927</a>, was usually held at the <a href="Henley%20Boat%20Races">Henley Boat Races</a> along the course. However, on at least two occasions in the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, the women competed on the Thames between <a href="Chiswick">Chiswick</a> and <a href="Kew">Kew</a>. Cambridge's women went into the race as reigning champions, having won the <a href="The%20Boat%20Races%202017%23Main%20races">2017 race</a> by 11, lengths, and led 42–30 overall. For the sixth year, the men's race was sponsored by <a href="The%20Bank%20of%20New%20York%20Mellon">BNY Mellon</a> while the women's race has BNY Mellon's subsidiary Newton Investment Management as sponsors.

<doc id="54741721" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54741721" title="Mistake fare">
Mistake fare

A mistake fare is a type of pricing error used in respect to the airline industry. It occurs when an airline accidentally puts the wrong price for a ticket listing on their website. Multiple companies and individuals have formed businesses that revolve around informing their customer base when a mistake fare is posted.

Concept.
Mistake fares are a pricing error in the airline industry that occurs as a result of a mistake on the seller end. When searching for these, customers will generally not find any, and the ones they find will not necessarily be a place they want to go to. Mistake fares can wildly range in price, some going so low as to even be free. There are different types of mistake fares, one of which is nicknamed the "fat finger fare." It refers to data entry mistakes or a misplaced decimal point. Another one includes the ability to get a cheaper flight by paying in a different currency. There have been multiple companies that were created to help people find these fares, including <a href="Airfarewatchdogs">Airfarewatchdogs</a> and <a href="Scott%27s%20Cheap%20Flights">Scott's Cheap Flights</a>.

Growth.
Mistake fares have received coverage, both in concept and in execution, by numerous sources. These include <a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a>, <a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>, and <a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>. Los Angeles Times writer Terry Gardner stated that the social media website <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> is the "new darling for travelers," due in part to the easy by which people can find mistake fares.

Compliance.
Mistake fares' capacity for working depends on the willingness of companies to comply with the mistake fares when they are made. Whether a mistake fare will be honored depends on the company as well as the laws and policies that a company has to adhere to. Federal regulations created certain restrictions to an airline's ability to refuse to honor mistake fares. There has been efforts to change regulations, including by the Department of Transportation in 2015. Such a change could pose a risk to the mistake fare industry if it allowed airlines to refuse such fares. However, the DOT also requires that airlines reimburse you for any non-refundable plans related to the ticket and your travel. In the past, consumers were largely opposed to the act of taking advantage of mistake fares; in more recent years however, they have become significantly more okay with this. USA Today writer Christopher Elliott noted the reason for this was that customers became more aware of certain practices done by airlines to, in the public perception, take as much money from consumers as possible. One argument on this situation is that the airlines employ a double standard. On one hand, branding consultant Talaya Waller argues that airlines take just as much advantage as consumers do, and are allowed to do so. On the other hand, website editor Kyle Stewart points out that a mistake made by the consumer is treated as the fault of the consumer's, but a mistake by an airline is not the fault of the airline. According to Skift writer Grant Martin, airlines go to lengths in order to prevent mistake fares from spreading. One tactic for this including monitoring public forums for posts about mistake fares. As Martin points out, the level of compliance a person may expect is based on the circumstances. For instance, some protections exist for standard flights with simple errors, while others - such as a mistake fare that was sold to residents of Denmark which required all buyers to claim that they lived in Denmark, do not.

Andrea Moor is a Brisbane-based actor known for with roles in theatre, film and television. She is also a stage director and teacher/lecturer. 

Early career to mid 2000's.
Moor was born in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, raised in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> and moved to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> in 1979. At 19 she travelled to London to study at <a href="East%2015%20Acting%20School">East 15</a> and returned to Sydney after a year. She enrolled at the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">National Institue of Dramatic Art</a> (NIDA) and graduated in 1985. 

She appeared in productions by all the major Sydney theatre companies including, <a href="Sydney%20Theatre%20Company">Sydney Theatre Company</a>, <a href="Ensemble%20Theatre">Ensemble Theatre</a>, <a href="The%20Stables">Stables Theatre</a>, Marion Street Theatre and <a href="Belvoir%20%28theatre%20company%29">Belvoir</a>. She travelled to England with the Sydney Theatre Company production of <a href="David%20Williamson">David Williamson</a>’s play "<a href="Emerald%20City%20%28play%29">Emerald City</a>." 

Moor was also appearing in films and on television including 59 episodes in the series <a href="Heartbreak%20High">Heartbreak High</a>.  She was also at times listed as Andrea Moore.     
Career 2005-.
Moor's parents were residents of Brisbane and following her fathers death she moved back to Brisbane with her family to be closer to her mother.

She subsequently appeared in many productions for Brisbane-based theatre companies <a href="La%20Boite%20Theatre%20Company">La Boite</a> and <a href="Queensland%20Theatre%20Company">Queensland Theatre Company</a>.

While continuing as an actor Moor moved into directing from 2007 as an assistant director. In late 2008 she had her  first role as director with the production of "Beautiful" at the Loft.   She directed plays for the Queensland Theatre Company and in 2014-2015 she was appointed a Resident Director at Queensland Theatre Company a joint position with <a href="Jason%20Klarwein">Jason Klarwein</a>. The role included “working on a range of projects from mainstage productions to works in development, youth programs and repertoire meetings.” For the second half of 2015 Moor's role moved to being Artistic Associate. Of the role of director Moor said, “While I love directing, and still find it incredibly challenging, at my heart I’m an actor.”  

Teaching.
Moor had studied at the the <a href="Atlantic%20Theater%20Company">Atlantic Theatre Company</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, the acting school founded by <a href="David%20Mamet">David Mamet</a> and <a href="William%20H.%20Macy">William H Macy</a>, which uses a technique known as <a href="Practical%20aesthetics">Practical Aesthetics</a>, the Atlantic Technique. 

Moor introduced this technique to Australia in 1994 and in 1998 she together with Melissa Bruder established the the “the official Sydney Annex of the , NYC.” She has run workshops on the technique at NIDA, <a href="Western%20Australian%20Academy%20of%20Performing%20Arts">Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts</a> (WAAPA), <a href="Queensland%20University%20of%20Technology">Queensland University of Technology</a> (QUT), <a href="London%20Academy%20of%20Music%20and%20Dramatic%20Art">London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts</a> (LAMDA), and Practical Aesthetics Australia (PAA) and in group settings. 

She had been offered teaching roles in institutions but wanted to investigate further on techniques to teach acting. In 2013 she was awarded her PhD as a Doctorate of Creative Industries. Her thesis was entitled "Contemporary Actor Training in Australia: A comparative survey of the efficacy of the acting methodologies implemented at four leading Australian actor-training institutions - National Institute of Dramatic Art, Queensland University of Technology, Victorian College of the Arts, and Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts." She then accepted a five-year role as Senior Lecturer and Head of Acting at Queensland University of Technology.

Moor describes her career as ‘reinventing myself or adding strings to my bow just in order to survive.’' She said that the combination of acting, directing and teaching will not lead to a secure financial future where she would have sufficient money to retire while a permanent teaching position offers more financial stability .Her studies had the unexpected advantage of giving her greater insight into her own work as an actor and director. She is on the boards of Queensland Theatre (formerly Queensland Theatre Company)and Metro Arts

In 2014 she was awarded a Churchill Fellowship. In her submission she wrote, "The purpose of this fellowship was to enlighten me as to current theatre practice in with particular focus on the work of outstanding female theatre directors, in order to enrich and challenge my own practice as theatre director and provide a benchmark for reflection of my own practice." 

Review acting.
Maureen Strugnell in a review in Stage Diary wrote of Moor's performance in "<a href="Vincent%20in%20Brixton">Vincent in Brixton</a>" as the mother of <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Vincent Van Gogh</a>,Andrea Moor is compelling in this role, suggesting by everything she does the effort that it takes to keep on functioning in a world that has lost all meaning. Whether she is rushing manically about the kitchen as in the opening scene, or moving with achingly painful slowness as the depression takes hold again, we watch fascinated. When she sits still, head in hands, she personifies despair and prefigures later portraits by Van Gogh of sorrowing women.

Joe Bullet

Joe Bullet is a South African action film. It stars <a href="Ken%20Gampu">Ken Gampu</a>. After being stored and not being seen for decades, it has now finally been re-released.

Background.
The producer of the film was Tonie van der Merwe. Independently released in 1973, it played at the Eyethu cinema in Soweto. And after just 2 screenings the film was banned. This was done because the South African government at the time were concerned about the influence it may have on black South Africans. For about 40 years the original film reels were stored in a box in the back of van der Merwe's garage gathering dust. He hung on to the reels every time he moved home.

The film was restored by Gravel Road Distribution under the supervision of it's original producer, Tonie van der Merwe.
Screenings.
The film was scheduled to appear at the MoMA annual film preservation festival in 2014. According to "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" in October 18, 2014, the film was to be screened at the New York fest on November 8th and 13th. 
It was announced on Jan 24, 2017 on "Channel24.co.za" that after 44 years the film was to be screened at the The Bioscope Independent Cinema in Johannesburg on January 24th and at The Company Gardens in Cape Town on January 25th.
Story.
A local soccer team gets caught up in the criminal underworld scene. It features Ken Gampu in the lead role playing the part of a strong action man, Joe Bullet. Described by "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" as being modeled on something between Shaft and James Bond, Joe Bullet drives sports cars, drinks, does karate, shoots guns throws knives and climbs up mineshafts. Singer Abigail Kubeka also has a role in the film.

Re-release.
The film will be available to the public in Blu-ray format on September 11. It's part of the Vault series from 88 Films which is a British film label.

<doc id="54741842" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54741842" title="Nanoparticle deposition">
Nanoparticle deposition

Nanoparticle deposition refers to the process of attaching <a href="nanoparticle">nanoparticle</a>s to solid surfaces called substrates to create <a href="coating">coating</a>s of nanoparticles. The coatings can have a <a href="monolayer">monolayer</a> or a multilayer and organized or unorganized structure based on the coating method used. Nanoparticles are typically difficult to deposit due to their physical properties.

Challenges.
Nanoparticles can be made from different materials such as metals, ceramics and polymers. The stability of the nanoparticles can be an issue as nanoparticles have a tendency to lower their very high <a href="surface%20energy">surface energy</a>, which originates from their high surface-to-bulk ratio. Bare nanoparticles tend to stabilize themselves either by sorption of molecules from the surroundings or by lowering the surface area through coagulation and agglomeration. Usually the formation of these aggregates is unwanted. The tendency of a nanoparticle to coagulate can be controlled by modifying the surface layer. In a liquid medium, suitable ligand molecules are commonly attached to the nanoparticle surface, as they provide solubility in suitable solvents and prevent coagulation.

Deposition methods.
There are multiple different coating methods available to deposit nanoparticles. The methods differ by their ability to control particle packing density and layer thickness, ability to use different particles and the complexity of the method and the instrumentation needed.

Langmuir-Blodgett.
In the <a href="Langmuir%E2%80%93Blodgett%20film">Langmuir-Blodgett</a> method, the nanoparticles are injected at air-water interphase in a special <a href="Langmuir%E2%80%93Blodgett%20trough">Langmuir-Blodgett Trough</a>. The floating particles are compressed closer to each other with motorized barriers which allow to control the packing density of the particles. After compressing the particles to the desired packing density, they are transferred on a solid substrate using vertical (Langmuir-Blodgett) or horizontal (Langmuir-Schaefer) dipping to create a monolayer coating. Controlled multilayer coatings can be made repeating the dipping procedure multiple times.

The benefits of the Langmuir-Blodgett method include a firm control over the packing density and the layer thickness achieved that have been shown to be better than with other methods, the ability to use different shapes and materials of substrates and particles and the possibility to characterize the particle layer during deposition for example a <a href="Brewster%20angle%20microscope">Brewster Angle Microscope</a>. As a disadvantage, a successful Langmuir-Blodgett deposition requires optimization of multiple measurement parameters such as dipping speed, temperature and dipping packing density.

Dip coating and spin coating.
The <a href="Spin%20coating">spin</a> and <a href="Dip-coating">dip coating</a> methods are simple methods for nanoparticle deposition. They are useful tools especially in creating self-assembled layers and films where the packing density isn't critical. Accurate and vibration-free sample withdrawal speeds can be used to have control over the film thickness. Creating high density monolayers is typically very difficult since the methods are lacking the packing density control. Also, the volume of nanoparticle suspension required for both spin coating and dip coating is rather big which may be an issue when using expensive nanoparticle materials.

Other methods.
Other possible deposition methods include methods utilizing particle self-assembly by solvent evaporation, doctor blade, <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a> and transfer printing. Some of these methods like solvent evaporation are extremely simple but produce low-quality films. Other methods such as the chemical vapor deposition are effective for certain types of particles and substrates but are limited in particle types that can be used and require heavier instrumentation investments. Also hybrid methods such as combining self-assembly to Langmuir-Blodgett have been used.

Nanoparticle coating applications.
Coatings and thin films made from nanoparticles are being used in various applications including displays, sensors, medical devices, energy storages and energy harvesting. Examples include

Project termination

PROJECT TERMINATION.
Project as the task performed within a specified time and goals so as to reach a certain output. It has to be put aware that project termination steps and procedures are very important for successful and failed projects. Every project has its specified time for it to end due to many reasons that may be positive or negative so to terminate a project does necessarily mean it’s a failure or anything to do with prematurely abandoned project. From the given facts above any project has to officially end at some points. Now we will take a look on when to terminate a project and who are responsible for project termination. 

VARIETIES OF PROJECT TERMINATION.
The followings are various ways to terminate a project
It occurs when the project has successfully completed or it has failed and much has to be done on the organization administrative part including transferring to its intended users and conducting all the final activities. The processes to include are the auditing of the final budget, new task assignment to the team members and any material assets of the project are transferred according to company policies or contractual conditions . 
The project becomes a formal part of the parent organization. This is when a project becomes promoted to a formal status within a particular organization. The project has been terminated and its success leads to its additional on the organizational structure.
This method of project termination looks like a common way but originally one of the complicated method for handling successful projects. The resources of the project including the team members are being integrated within an organization’s structure by following the project’s reached conclusions. 
Termination by this method of starvation may happen for a number of reasons that may a placated sponsor, general budget cuts or political reasons. In this category project is being cut off from the financial support or the budget is being decremented until the project cannot stand viable and the major reason for this kind of termination is to avoid embarrassment for the senior management due to project failure (Martin, 2007). 

WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT PROJECT TERMINATION?
A principal investigator is the one entrusted with the role of conducting a timely review of the project development phases, through close monitoring of the project progress. So the closing date for the project should be decided by the principal investigator after proper chain of communication with other important/critical project stakeholders. This project principal investigator has to be aware of the clear preparations of the financial and technical reports .

VARIOUS REASONS FOR THE PROJECT TERMINATION.
Objectives or goals have been met. One of the most important key issues on the project is to reach the defined goals. If the project progress has been evaluated and all the goals set for the project has been accomplished just ahead of time/schedule so it can be handled over to the sponsors/users. This is where the proper processes of project termination would take place .<br>

Less availability of the resources for the project performance to be taking place. In every project that takes place resources used they do vary from one kind to another. IT projects are different from other projects and so the resources do vary. At some cases facilities may be in a short supply than how it has been initially planned in turn it may lead to huge effect on the project. When the facilities are no longer available to help personnel perform various activities on the project it may be among the reasons for the project to be terminated.

<br>
Project does not meet company goals, on every company or organization there are strategies and objectives to be used as a map for different activities taking place within an organization. so when the project is taking place and objectives are not clearly stated or well documented to indicate the expectations to be gained from the project deliverable it becomes a total confusion, even the project team will not understand the work extent. Also on the cases when project objectives does not meet any of the company goals or doesn’t match the strategies of a particular organization/company then it’s not worth working on it. The procedures for project termination may take place to avoid chaos within a particular organization .

<br>
Project exceeds the budget, many of the projects run under the supply of funds through various monetary investments. A project may not give a maximum profit out the given investment but if the cost involved does not bring some profitable turnover or the investment is too high than predicted profit from the project it becomes worth scrapped. Looking at this factor that in every project life cycle there is a very important part of project planning where the project manager or project team gets a chance to use different tools to estimate the cost that a particular project will incur, so if it happens that the project gets way too expensive it gives a reason for it to be terminated.
<br>
Failure in the testing process, during project closure a testing process must take place and it is everyone expectation to see that a project brings out positive results during testing especially to the project owners/sponsors and it is very sad to see a project fail during testing. However in some cases the project might have done everything they could to ensure that the project succeeds but still it couldn’t the best choice is to put an end into a project rather than spending more energy and resource to an empty result investment .<br>

Change of Company/Organization Structure, Any project must work under broad organizational environment and so every project relies much on the structure of a particular organization and in situations where the company management hands changes the project may fail to proceed or exist or it may no longer be needed under the new management and hence be an enough reason for its termination.

GENERAL OVERVIEW.
In general when project termination occurs without completing identified objectives. A note has to be taken that emotional elements may be involved in one way or another. <br>
The most problematic situation is that many project termination represents failure. Some of the individuals may feel personally responsible for the particular project termination and may feel depressed as a result. Leaders of the organization must have mitigation plans to accommodate the negative effects of the project termination on the employee morale and the whole organization. <br>

One crucial thing that project managers must ensure is to make sure that objectives for any undertaken project are well defined and clear documented so as to reduce the certainty of project failure which leads to project termination in a negative way, <br>
this situation leads to embarrassment for most of the people within an organization or among the project team. <br>
Proper procedures should also be followed before termination of any project undertaken so as to make sure the whole process does not affect any of the organization reputable activities or operations to their targeted stakeholders.

Competition Report.
<a href="Gay%20McKenna">Gay McKenna</a> of Dublin had already secured three Irish Derby titles when he sent a team to the 1972 event, in an attempt to emulate his brother in law Tom Lynch, and secure a fourth crown. Two bitches called Congress Daisy and Catsrock Daisy were considered serious contenders for McKenna and would provide the opposition for English raider Suburban Gent, double <a href="St%20Leger%20%28Irish%20greyhounds%29">St Leger</a> champion Time Up Please, Itsachampion and the <a href="1971%20Irish%20Greyhound%20Derby">previous year’s finalists</a> Gahans Wood and Butlers Glen.

In the first round Congress Daisy recorded the fastest time of 29.15 closely followed by other winners Moordyk Sandy (29.18), Bedhust (29.20) and Eighthouses (29.20). In round two Catsrock Daisy (the recent <a href="Easter%20Cup%20%28greyhounds%29">Easter Cup</a> winner when trained by Sammy Easton) set the best time of 29.04. Congress Daisy recorded 29.11 and Ballykilty won in 29.18.

In the first semi-final Ballykilty beat Agamemnon in 29.14 but the old campaigner Kerryman (who was unbeaten going into the semis) failed to make the final again. Bedehust beat Catsrock Daisy in the second semi to remain unbeaten whilst a third race that was marred by trouble, ended with victory for Butlers Glen from Waggy Champion. In the third semi both Time Up Please and Congress Daisy were surprise eliminations.

The undefeated Bedhust was found to be lame and was withdrawn from the final which left Catsrock Daisy as the even money favourite and duly wrapped up that fourth title for McKenna. She broke well from the traps and maintained a lead all the way. Waggy Champion finished strongly to finish second and only lose by a neck.

Arthur Silliman House

The Arthur Silliman House is a private house located at 116 South Main Street in <a href="Three%20Rivers%2C%20Michigan">Three Rivers, Michigan</a>. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1979, and now houses The Historic Silliman Home and Blacksmith Shop.

History.
Arthur Silliman was born in 1831 in White Deer Valley, Pennsylvania to Alexander Silliman. In 1845, Samuel Silliman, one of Arthur's brothers, moved to <a href="St.%20Joseph%20County%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph County</a> and sent back glowing reports. Inspired by his son's success, Alexander Silliman moved his family to the same area in 1847. Arthur Silliman went into the blacksmith trade in the 1850s, first renting a building on Portage Avenue in Three Rivers. In 1864 he purchased two lots at the corner of Michigan and Main streets near this site, and constructed his own shop.

In 1867 Silliman sold his shop and purchased this plot of land next to the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">St. Joseph River</a>. He likely constructed this house soon after, in about 1868. The building served both as as the Silliman family home and as Arthur Silliman's blacksmith and wagon-building shop. He used the house for a number of years, and in 1903 deeded it to his daughter, Sue I. Silliman. Sue Silliman was a librarian and state historian for the Michigan <a href="Daughters%20of%20the%20American%20Revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a>. Her love of history prompted her to donate the house too the city of Three Rivers just before her death in 1945.

However, the city soon sold the house to the Three Rivers World War Veterans Home Association, and it was subsequently refurbished to provide a home for the local American Legion post. In 1976 the house was sold to the General Telephone Company of Michigan. The company proposed to donate the house to the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution on the condition that funds were raised for its restoration. These funds were raised, and in 1980 restoration work was begun. The restoration was completed the next year, and the house was deeded to the DAR. The house was opened to the public as a museum, and continues to operate as the The Historic Silliman Home and Blacksmith Shop.

Description.
The Arthur Silliman House is located on a sloped, narrow lot on the bank of the St. Joseph River, very close to the river itself. The house is a three-story rectangular flank-gable brick structure on a fieldstone foundation measuring 40 feet by 24 feet. Because of the slope of the lot, the lowest story is exposed on the river side, but underground on the opposite side. The windows are six-over-six lights with brick, segmental arch heads.

The house as originally built contained a blacksmith's shop on the first floor, living quarters (a hall, kitchen, dining room, living room, and two bedrooms) on the second, and open storage space on the third. There were no internal staircases connecting the floors, only exterior stairs.

Portland Road, Notting Hill

Portland Road is a road in <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a>, in the <a href="Royal%20Borough%20of%20Kensington%20and%20Chelsea">Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea</a> that was built as a speculative development in the 1850s. The road has been noted for its division into three sections of different wealth: the section between Holland Park Avenue and Clarendon Cross/Hippodrome Place being one of the most expensive places to buy a house in London, a section of terraced houses further north being also very expensive but less so than the lower reaches of the road, and a section at the northern end that was one slums and is now working class social housing and is described as being north of an "invisible line" that divides it from the privately owned sections of the road.

Location.
The road runs from <a href="Clarendon%20Road">Clarendon Road</a> in the north to <a href="Holland%20Park%20Avenue">Holland Park Avenue</a> in the south and is crossed by Hippodrome Place and Clarendon Cross. It is joined on its western side by <a href="Penzance%20Place">Penzance Place</a> and <a href="Pottery%20Lane">Pottery Lane</a>, and on its eastern side by Ladbroke Road. The part above Clarendon Cross was originally known as Montpellier Terrace and the part north of that as Portland Road North. The houses on the west side in the southern end of the road were originally known as Portland Gardens.

History.
Portland Road was built by speculative developers in the 1850s on a strip of land between the affluent <a href="Ladbroke%20Estate">Ladbroke Estate</a> to the east and the <a href="Norland%20Estate">Norland Estate</a> to the west, home to the <a href="Potteries%20and%20Piggeries">Potteries and Piggeries</a>, one of the most notorious slums in London. At first all the houses were rented and in the southern part occupied by well-off tenants with households of more modest means further north.

Winterbourne House was built between the wars in the northern part of the road behind Heathfield Street as part of the clearance of what was by then slum housing. It was partly occupied by people who worked in the adjacent <a href="Notting%20Hill%20Brewery">Notting Hill Brewery</a>. In the late 1930s, the far larger <a href="Nottingwood%20House">Nottingwood House</a> was built at the far northern end of the road on the site of the brewery and slum housing.

In the twentieth century the road began to decline with most of the houses being in multiple occupation.

Slum landlord <a href="Peter%20Rachman">Peter Rachman</a> owned property in the road.

From the 1960s the road began to be colonised by the middle classes again. In the later twentieth century, the road was blocked to vehicle traffic immediately below the junction with Hippodrome Place and Clarendon Cross, an action which has been seen as crystallising the class differences between the northern and the southern parts of the road. By the early twenty-first century, the southern end of the road had become a "ghetto" for bankers. It has been used as a case study of the <a href="gentrification">gentrification</a> of London streets.

The Light of Smiles

The Light of Smiles is the fourth album by American rock musician <a href="Gary%20Wright">Gary Wright</a>. It was released in January 1977 on <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> as the follow-up to his commercial breakthrough, "<a href="The%20Dream%20Weaver">The Dream Weaver</a>". The album was produced by Wright and recorded in Los Angeles in 1976. Aside from drums and orchestral strings, the music was created entirely on <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s and other keyboard instruments. The lyrics reflect Wright's preoccupation with spirituality, particularly the teachings of Indian <a href="yogi">yogi</a> <a href="Paramahansa%20Yogananda">Paramahansa Yogananda</a>.

Although the album failed to match the commercial impact of its predecessor, "The Light of Smiles" was moderately successful and received a favorable response from some music critics. In the United States, it peaked at number 23 on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"s albums chart, while the single "Phantom Writer" reached number 43 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">Hot 100</a>.

Background and recording.
<a href="Gary%20Wright">Gary Wright</a> began writing songs for "The Light of Smiles" while on tour in 1976, having become a popular concert draw with the success of "<a href="The%20Dream%20Weaver">The Dream Weaver</a>".<ref name="Welch/MM"> Available at <a href="http%3A//www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/yes-peter-frampton-gary-wright-jfk-stadium-philadelphia">Rock's Backpages</a> (subscription required).</ref> Recording started in Los Angeles during the summer, with Wright using members of his tour band, including keyboardist Peter Reilich and drummer Art Wood, and session musicians <a href="David%20Foster">David Foster</a> and <a href="Jim%20Keltner">Jim Keltner</a>, both of whom had contributed to "The Dream Weaver". In early June, <a href="Chris%20Charlesworth">Chris Charlesworth</a> of "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" reported that the new album would be "a logical development" of its predecessor and focus solely on sounds generated through keyboard instruments, particularly <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s.<ref name="CC/MM"> Available at <a href="http%3A//www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/gary-wright-wright-at-last">Rock's Backpages</a> (subscription required).</ref> Played mainly by Wright, Foster and Reilich, the range of keyboard instruments includes <a href="clavinet">clavinet</a>, organ, and <a href="Moog%20Music">Moog</a>, <a href="Oberheim%20Electronics">Oberheim</a> and <a href="ARP%20Instruments">ARP</a> synthesizers. Foster also provided arrangements for orchestral strings on some of the songs, such as the title track, "Time Machine", "I Am the Sky" and "Who Am I".

On "I Am the Sky", Wright gave a songwriting credit to the late Indian <a href="guru">guru</a> and <a href="Kriya%20Yoga">Kriya Yoga</a> teacher, <a href="Paramahansa%20Yogananda">Paramahansa Yogananda</a>. The latter's poem "The Light of Smiles", taken from his book "Metaphysical Meditations", appeared on the LP's inner sleeve. During the recording sessions, Wright and Foster also contributed to <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>'s first album for <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>, "<a href="Thirty%20Three%20%26amp%3B%201/3">Thirty Three & 1/3</a>", with Wright playing synthesizer on "<a href="See%20Yourself">See Yourself</a>", one of the album's two Yogananda-inspired tracks. Having been introduced to Yogananda's book "<a href="Autobiography%20of%20a%20Yogi">Autobiography of a Yogi</a>" by Harrison in the early 1970s, Wright subsequently acknowledged the guru as a lifelong influence. The front cover of "The Light of Smiles" includes a portrait of Wright painted by John Silletto.

Release and reception.
Warner Bros. issued "The Light of Smiles" in January 1977, with "Phantom Writer" as the album's lead single. Wright toured extensively to promote the release. In his 2014 autobiography, he regrets choosing "Phantom Writer" for the single, and cites this decision as an example of his "smug" belief that, after his hit singles "<a href="Dream%20Weaver">Dream Weaver</a>" and "<a href="Love%20Is%20Alive%20%28Gary%20Wright%20song%29">Love Is Alive</a>" in 1976, "anything I released would be hugely successful". Wright says he should have edited down "Water Sign" instead for release as the lead single.

Although it failed to match the commercial success of "The Dream Weaver", the album proved popular. On the U.S. charts compiled by "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine, it peaked at number 23, while "Phantom Writer" reached number 43 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">Hot 100</a>.

"Billboard"s reviewer recognized "The Light of Smiles" as an advance on "The Dream Weaver", in that "Wright proves himself even more highly developed as a virtuoso of blending ethereal sounds into a brilliantly commercial texture." The reviewer also said: "His arrangements are increasingly varied and dynamic, his voice is more flexible and feathery than ever. This is softly pulsating, spacey music that never gets boring or pretentious."

In his review for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", <a href="Stephen%20Holden">Stephen Holden</a> admired the album for blending "the erotic and the spiritual into an overawed romanticism" with a subtlety that he found lacking in other examples of contemporary "mystical <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a>", and for Wright's use of musical virtuosity "as elements of song structure and not as side trips or self-justifying entities". He said that although the Yogananda-inspired lyrics engaged with spirituality on a more superficial level than artists such as <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href="Andy%20Pratt%20%28singer-songwriter%29">Andy Pratt</a> and Harrison applied in their work, "such sweetness issuing from one who sounds like <a href="Stevie%20Winwood">Stevie Winwood</a> beatified is almost impossible to dislike." Holden concluded by saying that "The Light of Smiles" was "even sweeter than its predecessor" and so would "cinch Gary Wright's position as prince of the new guru rock". Writing in "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Record%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Record Guide</a>", however, <a href="Dave%20Marsh">Dave Marsh</a> dismissed the album with a one-star review. Marsh grouped it with Wright's next two releases as examples of the artist's overindulgence and propensity for "a spacy, mystical froth of synthesizers and remarkably poor vocalizing".<ref name="Marsh/RS"></ref>

Cheloctonus jonesii

Cheloctonus jonesii is a species of <a href="scorpion">scorpion</a> in the family <a href="Hemiscorpiidae">Hemiscorpiidae</a> (Liochelidae) native to southern Africa.

Description.
Up to 9 cm (3.5 in) long, it is variable in appearance; all black in northern <a href="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a> and brown with yellow legs in <a href="Mpumalanga">Mpumalanga</a>. The legs are otherwise rust-coloured. It has a heavy-set body with stocky legs and stout arms (pedipalps) with short pincers (<a href="Chela%20%28organ%29">chelae</a>). Its <a href="cephalothorax">cephalothorax</a> around 11 mm long and broader (11.5 mm) across. The tail is around 3.5 cm (1.4 in) long. British naturalist <a href="R.%20I.%20Pocock">R. I. Pocock</a> described the scorpion in 1892, naming it after the person who collected the specimen in the Murchison Range in what was then Transvaal, C.R.Jones.

Habitat.
"Cheloctonus jonesii" is native to Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland and eastern South Africa, where it is especially common in KwaZulu-Natal, there reaching densities of two burrows per three square metres. In <a href="Jozini">Jozini</a>, densities of four per square metre have been reported. It lives in areas of clay-based soil with annual rainfall of 800–1250 mm (30–50 in), shunning waterlogged locales. It excavates a vertical burrow around 18 cm (7 in) long, generally located at the base of a tuft of grass or among multiple tufts. The scorpion takes 2–3 nights to complete this, using its pincers to loosen the ground and then pedipalps and pincers as spades to carry the soil away.

It eats dung beetles, which fall into its burrow. "C. jonesii" has also been reported killing the <a href="red-billed%20quelea">red-billed quelea</a>.

Among creatures that prey on "C. jonesii" are large centipedes of the genus "<a href="Scolopendra">Scolopendra</a>", the ground foraging <a href="red-billed%20hornbill">red-billed hornbill</a> ("Tockus erythrorhynchus") and <a href="eastern%20yellow-billed%20hornbill">eastern yellow-billed hornbill</a> ("T. flavirostris"), <a href="bushveld%20gerbil">bushveld gerbil</a> ("Gerbilliscus leucogaster"), <a href="Cape%20porcupine">Cape porcupine</a> ("Hystrix africaeaustralis") and <a href="lesser%20red%20musk%20shrew">lesser red musk shrew</a> ("Crocidura hirta").

D'ror Yikra

D'ror Yikra (also spelled Dror Yikra, Deror Yikra and Dror Yiqra) is a <a href="piyyut">piyyut</a> (Jewish religious song or hymn) traditionally sung during Sabbath meals, particularly the first meal of Friday evening. It was written in 960 CE in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Córdoba</a> in Spain by the poet, linguist and musician <a href="Dunash%20ben%20Labrat">Dunash ben Labrat</a> (915-70), who is said to have been born in <a href="Fez%2C%20Morocco">Fez, Morocco</a> but moved to Spain after a period of study in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> under the rabbinic scholar <a href="Saadia%20Gaon">Saadia Gaon</a>.

The Poem.
The poem consists of six four-line stanzas with the rhyme-scheme a a a a, b b b b, c c c c, etc. The first stanza is as follows:

The first letters of each line in this stanza, and also in stanzas 2, 3, and 6, make up the name "DUNASH".

Metre.
The poem was unusual for the time since unlike previous piyyutim, its language is entirely Biblical, rather than a mixture of Biblical and later Hebrew. Secondly, Dunash was apparently the first Jewish poet to write Hebrew using Arabic quantitative metres (up to his time, Hebrew poetry had been based on stress, not on quantity). Dunash's two innovations caused a revolution in Jewish poetry and influenced all later poets.

The metre itself is the <a href="hazaj%20meter">"hazaj"</a> metre (called in Hebrew , "ha-mishqal ha-marnin"), which is based on a repeated rhythm of short-long-long-long, a rhythm which it shares with the well-known <a href="Adon%20Olam">Adon Olam</a>. It is sung to two or three different tunes, not all of which, however, follow the rhythm of the metre.

Biblical references.
The poem is full of Biblical references and quotations, sometimes adapted to suit the demands of the metre. For example, the opening words are based on Leviticus 25:10: "You shall proclaim release throughout the land" and Jeremiah 34:15: "Proclaim a release for them". "He will keep you as the apple (or pupil) of His eye" is based on Deuteronomy (32:10): “He engirded him, watched over him, guarded him as the pupil of His eye”. "Pleasant is Your name" is based on Psalm 35:3: "Sing hymns to His name, for it is pleasant"; and "Repose, rest" comes from Numbers 22:19 ("sit and rest").

<doc id="54742270" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54742270" title="George Freedman">
George Freedman

George Freedman (<a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, New York, USA, 6 March 1936 - Sydney, NSW, Australia, 21 July 2016) was Australia’s "leading" Interior Designer/ Interior Architect from 1970 until a younger generation became prominent in Sydney during the 1990s. Born in New York, where he studied architecture at Syracuse University, Freedman arrived in Sydney in 1968 and later designed many prestigious interiors, often including custom-made furniture. His notable interior schemes included executive suites for the Bank of New South Wales (1970) and the State Bank of NSW (1985), cultural institutions including Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum/Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (1988), businesses, government premises, restaurants, residences and historic monuments, including a refurbishment of the Queen Victoria Building shopping centre (2009)[3].

In 2005, Freedman was described by The Sydney Morning Herald as ‘the Godfather of Interior Design’. He was recognised by design and architecture industry experts for his daring and widely emulated combinations of colours, inventive uses of materials, attention to detail, and commitment to high-quality furnishings (often imported signature classics)[5]. He was respected also for his sophisticated understandings of optical perception and volumetric manipulations of interior space. For this reason he was highlighted by design writers as practising more like an architect than his colleagues who were educated as interior decorators and designers[6]. Although he never finalised his American degree studies to register as an architect, Freedman worked repeatedly with Sydney’s leading architects of the late-twentieth century—including Glenn Murcutt, Peter Stronach, Richard Johnson and Ken Woolley. He also trained some of Sydney’s outstanding younger architects and designers—including Iain Halliday, Sam Marshall, Stephen Varady, William MacMahon, Arthur Collin, Robert Puflett, Tim Allison and his late-career partner, Ralph Rembel. In 2005 the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW Chapter) awarded Freedman Rembel an Interior Architecture commendation for its design of executive offices at the AMP Insurance building overlooking Circular Quay.

Freedman’s 1970s and 1980s furniture designs, often finished with luxury European veneers and eye-catching flourishes, were often promoted in Australia’s most stylish design magazines, especially Belle and Interior Design. His cocktail trolley for Bilson’s restaurant (1988) is in the collection of Sydney’s Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. He was a Fellow of the Design Institute of Australia and the Academy of Design Australia. 

Early Life.
Freedman was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Nathan Freedman, a colour designer for an American paint manufacturer, and Rose Freedman (née Hirsch). His childhood memories included riding horses in Manhattan’s Central Park, and their home interior paint colour was changed every second year to challenging new colours. 

Education.
From 1949 to 1953, Freedman attended Manhattan High School, then studied architecture at Syracuse University and began working from 1960 with architects Kahn and Jacobs, where he worked on the American Airlines’ first class lounge at John F. Kennedy Airport. He abandoned the final year of his degree to travel to Europe; initially Ibiza, with his partner; Ronald Vance. During 1963 and 1964, he exhibited and sold artworks in Amsterdam and Brussels, then worked as an interior designer for architects Tandy Halford and Mills in London.
Returning to New York in 1968, Freedman joined the international planning unit of leading furniture manufacturers and interior designers Knoll and Associates. He worked with director Florence Knoll, who maintained close ties with many European and American leaders of modern design. Freedman’s projects with Knoll included the United States pavilion for the 1970 Osaka World Fair and offices for accountants Price Waterhouse in Buffalo, NY.

Life in Australia.
In 1969, Knoll despatched Freedman to Sydney to ‘Manhattanise and Internationalise’ the executive and boardrooms for the Bank of New South Wales, one of Australia’s oldest banks (founded in 1817 and renamed Westpac in 1982).

While working on this project, Freedman began a personal relationship with prominent Sydney decorator Neville Marsh—who employed him as a designer with Neville Marsh Interiors in 1970. To exploit Freedman’s international experience, they agreed that the practice should ‘go modern’, and in 1973, the business was rebranded Marsh Freedman Associates (MFA).

As well as designing interiors for some of Sydney’s most prestigious and prosperous families, MFA created sophisticated fine dining rooms for some of Sydney’s outstanding restaurateurs, notably Anne Taylor (Taylors, 1984); Tony and Gay Bilson (Berowra Waters Inn, 1976; Kinselas, 1983; Treasury, 1992, and Ampersand, 1998; Damien and Josephine Pignolet (Claudes, 1981); Helen and Malcolm Spry (Chez Oz, 1985); Leon Fink (Bilsons and Quay, 1986, 1988), and Armando Percuoco (Buon Ricordo Ristorante refurbishment, 2007).

During the late 1980s, Neville Marsh retired from Marsh Freedman Associates and Freedman continued to practice as George Freedman Associates (with Robert Chester and Sam Marshall). In 2002 he appointed a younger architect, Ralph Rembel, as his business partner and renamed the practice 'Freedman Rembel'. This practice was dissolved in 2010, when Freedman joined architects Peddle Thorp and Walker as Head of Interior Design (but he continued consulting to his existing private clients).

Personal Life.
Freedman was widely known for his waspish wit, warm laugh, home cooking, Negronis, and devotion to his dogs (owned in pairs shared). 
His initial partner from New York was Ronald Vance who he travelled with throughout the England and Europe. He subsequently met Neville Marsh, both his business and personal partner in 1969. During the 1990's Freedman cared for Marsh and was supported by Andrew Bryan. In 2005 he met and later exchanged vows at Saint Chapelle in Paris with psychologist Peter O'Brien. In 2014 they had a formal same sex wedding in New Zealand. Freedman died from cancer in Sydney in 2016, aged 80. Within Centennial Parklands there is a dedicated hoop pine tree for George Freedman. Visitors are encouraged to leave a stone.

NGC 2539

NGC 2539 is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> in the constellation <a href="Puppis%20%28constellation%29">Puppis</a>, located at the north edge of the constellation. It was discovered by <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> on January 31, 1785. It is a moderately rich cluster and with little central concentration, with Trumpler class II1m.

Characteristics.
Mermilliod and Mayor studied 11 <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>s within the cluster, the brightest of which was mag 9.509 and of spectral type K5I-II, and two non-members. Three of this stars where found to be spectographic <a href="binary%20star">binaries</a>, while further studies indicated that one of them is a triple system. Two more are suspected douple stars. Further studies revealed seven variable stars, 5 eclipsing binaries, one <a href="delta%20Scuti%20variable">delta Scuti variable</a> and one <a href="gamma%20Doradus%20variable">gamma Doradus variable</a>, with the gamma Doratus variable star membership being questionable. From the eclipsing binaries, one is field star and in a further study one more eclipsing binary (specifically a <a href="W%20Ursae%20Majoris%20variable">W Ursae Majoris variable</a>) was found to lie at the background.

The core radius of the cluster is 1.98 parsecs (6.5 light years), while the tidal radius is 15.2 parsecs (50 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 2539, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. The diametre of the cluster based on the location of possible members is estimated to be 7.4 parsecs (24 light years).
151 stars, probable members of the cluster, are located within the central part of the cluster and 455 probable members are located within the angular radius of the cluster. <a href="19%20Puppis">19 Puppis</a>, visible near the edge of the cluster is a foreground star. The <a href="Turnoff%20point">turn-off mass</a> of the cluster is at 3.1 . The <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> of the cluster is 0.14, higher than the solar one. The age of the cluster has been estimated to be as high as 630 myrs.

Jane's ATF: Advanced Tactical Fighters

Jane's ATF: Advanced Tactical Fighters is a 1996 <a href="combat%20flight%20simulator">combat flight simulator</a> developed and published by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>. It is part of the <a href="Jane%27s%20Combat%20Simulations">Jane's Combat Simulations</a> franchise.

Reception.
In "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>", Denny Atkin wrote, "Stripped of multiplayer mode, "ATF" is little more than another USNF data disk with a nice multimedia aircraft encyclopedia. But once you take on a human player, the game takes on new life, and becomes one of the most purely "fun" flight simulator experiences in existence today." Steve Wartofsky called "ATF" an "evolutionary rather than revolutionary step" for Jane's Combat Simulations, but argued that it "sets the standard for offering players a truly complete piece of work." While he found its graphics to be a "mixed bag", he enjoyed the game overall, and highlighted its encyclopedia as its best feature.

Writing for "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>", Dan Bennett called "ATF" "a solid, good-looking sim with a lot of variety and some really nice trimmings." Although he found the game to be overly difficult, he summarized it as a product that "belongs in every air combat fan's collection."

In 1996, the editors of "Computer Gaming World" nominated "ATF" for their "Simulation of the Year" award, which ultimately went to "<a href="EF2000%20%28video%20game%29">EF2000</a>". They wrote that "ATF" "makes up for its aging engine by providing the best multiplayer environment of any modern sim."

In November 2015 it was reported that from January 2016, Frankel would be editor-in-chief of "AnOther". Frankel has also contributed to "<a href="Dazed">Dazed & Confused</a>" since 1998. When <a href="Alexandra%20Shulman">Alexandra Shulman</a> announced in 2017 that she was stepping down as editor of <a href="Vogue%20%28British%20magazine%29">British "Vogue"</a>, it was speculated that Frankel might be a contender to succeed her due to her experience and the inclusivity of her vision.

In 1999, Frankel was the fashion journalist selected by the <a href="Fashion%20Museum%2C%20Bath">Fashion Museum, Bath</a>, to pick out the most representative look for that year for their <a href="Dress%20of%20the%20Year">Dress of the Year</a> collection.

Her first book, "Visionaries", which was published by the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in 2001, was a collection of her interviews with designers.

Frankel was a close and supportive friend of Alexander McQueen from the beginning of his career, and from early on, had McQueen's permission to write his authorised biography.

<doc id="54742946" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54742946" title="Male expendability">
Male expendability

Male expendability is the idea that society can better cope with the loss of a typical man than with the loss of a typical woman. This belief is characteristic of <a href="patriarchy">patriarchal</a> orders.

Øystein Gullvåg Holter argues that the male-led Russian government's belief in male expendability contributed to their delay in seeking international help during the <a href="Kursk%20submarine%20disaster">Kursk submarine disaster</a>, in which an all-male crew was lost. He notes, "If 118 women had been killed, alarm bells regarding discrimination against women would probably have gone off around the world." He notes that able-bodied males were viewed as a more legitimate target during wars in <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnia</a>, <a href="Kosovan%20War">Kosovo</a>, <a href="Timorese%20War">Timor</a>, <a href="Rwandan%20War">Rwanda</a>, and <a href="Chechnyan%20War">Chechnya</a>.

Ivana Milojević notes that while patriarchy assigns the role of <a href="sex%20object">sex object</a> to women, it assigns to men the role of violence-object, with male expendability being corollary to the sexual objectification of girls. Films such as "<a href="They%20Were%20Expendable">They Were Expendable</a>" or "<a href="The%20Expendables%20%282010%20film%29">The Expendables</a>" often are about all-male combat teams. Michael D. Clark notes that <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> considered gay men expendable by means of <a href="Nazi%20work%20camp">Nazi work camp</a>s and <a href="Nazi%20medical%20experiments">Nazi medical experiments</a>. <a href="Manosphere">Manosphere</a> critics of feminism have argued that poor and working-class men "are cannon fodder abroad and expendable labor at home, trapped beneath a glass floor in jobs nobody really wants -- farm workers, roofers, garbage men -- and injured at far higher rates than women." <a href="Walter%20Block">Walter Block</a> argues in "The Case for Discrimination" that male expendability is the result of women's being the bottleneck of reproductive capacity in a population.

Marantette Bridge

The Marantette Bridge, also known as the Railroad Street Bridge, is a historic vehicle bridge, now closed to traffic, located at Railroad Street over the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">St. Joseph River</a> in <a href="Mendon%2C%20Michigan">Mendon, Michigan</a>. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2001.

History.
One of the first settlers in Mendon was the Indian trader Patrick Marantette, who arrived in 1833 to manage a trading post located at the site of the <a href="Marantette%20House">Marantette House</a> near this bridge on the south side of the river. The first local bridge over the St. Joseph River was constructed in 1839 about two-thirds of a mile upstream from the Marantette Bridge. In the late 1850s, the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%20and%20Indiana%20Railroad">Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad</a> first proposed a line through Mendon, and in anticipation, Patrick Marantette platted the portion of his land north of the river, including the current Railroad Street. There was apparently no bridge serving Railroad Street until 1873.

The 1873 bridge was replaced in 1876. The current bridge was probably built in about 1900. The bridge was constructed by the <a href="Massillon%20Bridge%20Company">Massillon Bridge Company</a> located in <a href="Massillon%2C%20Ohio">Massillon, Ohio</a>. The bridge served vehicular traffic until 1984, when it was closed.

Description.
The Marantette Bridge is a single span, eight panel steel <a href="Pratt%20truss%20bridge">Pratt through-truss bridge</a> with pinned connections. It measures 141 feet in length and 16 feet in width, and is supported with rubble fieldstone abutments. The bridge has a wooden plank deck, now severely deteriorated, set atop steel stringers and supported by transverse girders. The upper structure is constructed of channels connected by cover plates.

<doc id="54743347" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54743347" title="Ticketer">
Ticketer

Ticketer is the brand name for a range of <a href="electronic%20ticket%20machine">electronic ticket machine</a>s provided by British company Corvia Ltd, primarily for usage on <a href="buses">buses</a>. The "innovative" <a href="Cloud%20computing">cloud-based</a> system, first marketed on a small scale in 2008, has since developed into a rival to the three major ticket issuing systems used by bus companies throughout Britain.

History and development.
Ticketer was developed in the mid-2000s by two former employees of Wayfarer Transit Systems, a major supplier of public transport fare collection systems. The company they set up dealt with small, independent bus operators, many of which used Wayfarer machines but wanted a simpler system which was easier to upgrade and configure in-house. In partnership with a <a href="Mobile%20app%20development">mobile app developer</a>, the company set up a prototype consisting of a <a href="Thermal%20printing">thermal printer</a> and a <a href="Mobile%20computing">mobile computer</a> running on the <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> platform. Independent operator <a href="Courtney%20Buses">Courtney Buses</a> trialled this system during 2007 and 2008; a modified version was then designed and offered for sale under the Ticketer brand. In 2009 the newly formed company Corvia Ltd bought the rights to the system and began to market it widely, particularly to independent bus operators.

Features.
There are three parts to the Ticketer system's hardware: all are generic "off-the-shelf" products which can be replaced individually if necessary. A rugged touch-screen mobile computer with an in-built <a href="GPS%20tracking%20unit%23Data%20pushers">GPS beacon</a> forms the control unit. This is connected to a thermal printer. A <a href="Card%20reader%23Smart%20card%20readers">smartcard reader</a> with <a href="ITSO%20Ltd">ITSO compatibility</a> is mounted alongside this. The built-in <a href="GPS">GPS</a> means that the ticket machines double up as a tracking device, and they communicate back to the office via <a href="GPRS">GPRS</a>.

Corvia licenses out the Ticketer system per machine, allowing for an unlimited number of concurrent uses of the ticket machine. Ticketer requires no depot infrastructure to run; instead, it is run as a cloud-based <a href="software%20as%20a%20service">software as a service</a> (SaaS). Older ticket issuing systems required machines to be returned to a depot for data transfer—either wirelessly via a <a href="local%20area%20network">local area network</a> or physically using an external module into which the machine would be docked.

Messages between the driver and depot can also be sent via the ticket machine and fares can easily be changed through an online portal. All configuration of fares, route data and graphical features on tickets (such as operator logos and customised advertisements—a feature developed in 2017) is done through a <a href="Secure%20communication">secure</a> web-based interface accessible through any device with online access. Updates are downloaded to machines in real time via GPRS.

Since early 2017 Ticketer has fully supported <a href="contactless%20payment">contactless payment</a>, and has been used on buses in order to introduce such technology. The system collects such payments from one customer into one large transaction, which cuts down on charges received when dealing with card payments. Around the same time, separate <a href="Barcode%23Matrix%20%282D%29%20barcodes">2D barcode</a> scanners were introduced and can be added on to the system, and barcodes have started to be printed on certain types of ticket.

Products.
There are four types of ticket machine sold under the Ticketer brand, with different hardware designs for different purposes. All hardware is manufactured in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and the software is also developed in the UK. Tickets from each system are similar; most differences are attributable to the different printers used.

Ticketer Large.
The 'most popular' ticket machine, Ticketer Large, is designed for busy urban routes. It is a fixed point solution, with an <a href="ITSO%20Ltd">ITSO</a>-compliant <a href="smart%20card">smart card</a> reader, printer and an <a href="electronic%20point%20of%20sale">electronic point of sale</a> machine. This was the original Ticketer system; the other three machines, which differ only in their hardware, were developed by Corvia at the request of bus operators who had special requirements.

Ticketer Compact.
A smaller version of the large system, Ticketer Compact, is designed for buses where passengers alight away from the driver. The printer is smaller and the card reader is mounted on top of it. There is no <a href="QR%20code">QR code</a> reader. It is used especially by "community bus" operators which use small vehicles with non-standard interior layouts.

Handheld ETM.
A completely mobile machine, named 'Handheld ETM', was launched in 2014. It is an all-in-one solution designed for instances where fixed machines cannot be used, with the same functionality. The control unit, printer and card reader are mounted together in a portable case which can also be fixed inside a bus if necessary. Users include operators of occasional services or routes on which tickets would rarely be issued (such as school buses).

Ticketer in a Case.
This is identical to the Ticketer Large but is mounted onto the side of a <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> case and can be operated by mains power. It is intended for semi-mobile solutions, such as where a machine may need to be used outside the bus.

Usage.
Ticketer has been used by a range of UK bus operators, such as:

Most early users were small independent operators and municipally owned bus companies, but the placing of orders in early 2017 by the <a href="Oxford%20Bus%20Company">Oxford Bus Company</a> and <a href="First%20Glasgow">First Glasgow</a> suggests the large transport groups such as <a href="First%20Group">First Group</a> and Go-Ahead Group may adopt Ticketer more widely. Until Ticketer was launched, most bus companies used ticket machines from one of three rival companies: Metric Group Ltd's Almex system, the Wayfarer system of Parkeon, and <a href="Vix%20Technology">Vix Technology</a>'s Vix-ERG system.

Problems.
In the case of Reading Buses, 11,500 pre-paid <a href="smart%20cards">smart cards</a> had to be reissued so they were able to work with Ticketer.

Diocese of Sarsenterum (Latin: "Dioecesis Sarsenterensis") was a Latin <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="diocese">diocese</a> in the area of present <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>.

History.
The Diocese of Sarsenterum was established during the Second Church Synod in <a href="Salona">Salona</a> in 533 presided by archbishop Honorius II. The Diocese was given the basilicas from the municipal areas of "Dellontino", "Stantino", "Nouense (Neuense) per Rusticiarum", "Potuatico", "Beuzavatico (Benzavatico)" and others as well. The priest Paulinus was elected and consacrated as its first bishop.

In 2009 pope Benedict XVI restored it as a <a href="titular%20see">titular see</a> and appointed <a href="Petar%20Raji%C4%8D">Petar Rajič</a> as titular Archbishop of Sarsenterum.

Localization.
Since no epigraphic inscription has been found to localize Sarsenterum, there are different theories about the location of this settlement.

<a href="Wilhelm%20Tomaschek">Wilhelm Tomaschek</a> located the settlement in the village of <a href="Goranci%20%28Mostar%29">Goranci</a>. <a href="Dominik%20Mandi%C4%87">Dominik Mandić</a> questioned his opinion arguing that there were no traces of an important ancient settlement in that area as well that area was difficult to access and did not have the source of fresh water.

Interfaith Environmental Conferences.
Rabbi Neril has co-organized several interfaith environmental conferences in Jerusalem, New York City, and Washington D.C.

International Seminar on Science & Religion for Environment Care (2016, Spain).
In June, 2016, Rabbi Neril presented at the International Seminar on Science and Religion for Environment Care Torreciudad, Spain and at a press conference in Madrid. The Seminar concluded with a Torreciudad declaration that summarised in six points how a partnership between science and religion could promote ecological sustainability.

Parliament of World Religions (2015, Salt Lake City).
Rabbi Neril, together with H.H. Swami Chidanand Saraswati, Rev. Michael Bernard Beckwith, Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati, spoke at the “Climate Change and You” event which formed part of the Parliament of World Religions in 2015. Rabbi Neril spoke to the moral imperative to take action in light of mounting environmental degradation.

The Islamic Climate Change Symposium (2015, Istanbul).
Rabbi Neril spoke along with other religious figures at the International Islamic Climate Change Symposium in Istanbul, Turkey in August 2015. The aim of the gathering was to release the Islamic Climate Change Declaration, which intended to provide an “urgent and radical reappraisal” of today’s humanity. 
Faith and Ecology Conference for Seminarians (2014, Jerusalem).
In October, 2014, Rabbi Neril spoke at the Faith and Ecology Conference for Seminarians in Jerusalem, which was co-organized by the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the Salesian Pontifical University. He discussed the importance of current and emerging faith leaders being a potential vehicle for environmental stewardship and to expand ecology and environmental teaching and action within seminaries. Over 100 Muslim, Christian and Jewish clergy and seminary students attended the event.

Interfaith Climate and Energy Conference (2012, Jerusalem).
In March, 2012, Rabbi Neril spoke at and co-organized  the Interfaith Climate and Energy Conference in Jerusalem, which was focused on promoting change and action for a sustainable development within faith communities around the globe. The conference was co-organized by ICSD and the <a href="Konrad%20Adenauer%20Stiftung">Konrad Adenauer Stiftung</a>.

Interfaith Eco Forum (2011, Jerusalem).
In July 2011, Rabbi Neril and the ICSD team organized an interfaith panel of Jewish, Muslim and Christian authorities, who discussed the religious importance of ecological sustainability. The panelists were Auxiliary Bishop to the <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem</a> Msgr. William Shomali, the Deputy Minister of the <a href="Palestinian%20Authority">Palestinian Authority</a>’s Ministry of Religious Affairs Haj Salah Zuheika and <a href="American%20Jewish%20Committee">AJC</a> International Director of Inter-religious Affairs <a href="Rabbi%20David%20Rosen">Rabbi David Rosen</a>, and Rabbi Neril also spoke at the event...

Press Conference: Judaism, Christianity and Islam religious leaders unite to adress Climate Change (2017, Jerusalem).
In the Jerusalem Press Club, on July 26, 2017, Rabbi Yonatan Neril summoned three esteemed religious: a judge of the Muslim Sharia Courts in Israel, Kadi Iyad Zahalha; Rabbi David Rosen, AJC International Director of Interreligious Affairs; and the Custos of the Holy Land, Father Francesco Patton. The event focused on the key role faith leaders can play on raising awareness of the relevance and urgency of curbing climate change and achieving environmental sustainability. As Rabbi Neril, who acted as moderator of the panel, pointed out: ““Religions are the biggest, richest NGOs in the world. Studies have shown that 85 percent of the people in the world identify with religion. They have huge resources, land holdings, media networks. They must be involved”. The three authorities agreed on the need of putting aside religious and ideological differences for the uppermost necessity of restraining environmental degradation and the depletion of natural resources, for the wellbeing and future of our “common home”. 

Personal.
Rabbi Neril lives with his wife Shana and two children in Jerusalem.

Views.
Rabbi Neril writes frequently on religion and ecology, climate change, and environmental sustainability, including for blogs on The Huffington Post and The Times of Israel. He has written about how “climate change is the greatest long-term challenge to human civilization,” and how contemporary consumer society is what is driving extreme heat, desertification, water scarcity, and pollution. He has emphasized how the climate crisis is as much ecological as it is spiritual, and how in our times, living righteously demands being ecologically responsible. He has stressed the importance of clergy taking a leadership role in helping fatih adherents think long-term, moderate consumption, and rein in greed.

He has written about the importance of cultivating awareness to address problems where we do not see a direct link between our actions and the problem. The more ignorant a person is to how their lifestyle (private car, high consumption of both meat and fossil fuels, global travelling, mass consumption of programmed-obsolescence products) impact their surroundings, the more likely they are to damage it. In order to face this crisis “a critical mass of people need to undergo consciousness change and consumption change”, and to subordinate religious and ideological differences to the urgent need of curbing climate change. Neril quotes the words of the Jewish sage Hillel and states: “ if not now, when”?

However, the first written reference to the two paintings is in 1627, by which time they were in the <a href="Gonzaga">Gonzaga</a> collection in <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> (the Maffeis were closely linked to the Gonzagas). Between 1627 and 1628 both paintings were acquired from the Gonzagas by <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">Charles I</a> and it is attested as being in <a href="Whitehall%20Palace">Whitehall Palace</a> in 1639.

At the sale of Charles' goods it was valued at £800 and sold on 23 October 1651 to Thomas Bagley, a glazier in the royal household.

Olive E. Dana

Olive E. Dana (December 24, 1859 - ) was an American short-story writer, essayist, and poet. In her literary work, Dana showed her <a href="New%20England">New England</a> heritage. She was born in <a href="Augusta%2C%20Maine">Augusta, Maine</a>, in 1859, where she always resided. After high school graduation in 1877, she began to write for the press. Except when incapacitated by illness, she was a constant contributor thereafter, both in prose and verse, to many of the literary and religious publications. Her work included articles on home topics and reviews, biographical sketches and short stories. She was a frequent contributor to the columns of the "Journal of Education", the "Cottage Hearth", "Good Housekeeping", "Portland Transcript", and "Illustrated Christian Weekly", having published some 300 articles since her literary career began. "The Magi", is illustrative of her best poetic ability.
Early years and education.
Olive E. Dana was born in Augusta, Maine, December 24, 1859. Her parents were James Wolcott Dana and Sarah W. Savage.

She is a direct descendant of Richard Dana, whose name appears upon the records of <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, in 1640, and who was the founder of a family which contributed in a marked degree to the social, literary, and political advancement of the U.S. Patriots, soldiers, preachers, editors, authors, scientists, college presidents and professors bear the name of Dana. The immigrant Dana was of English birth; but it is believed that there was some French ancestry in his family, and this may have given to the Danas some of the characteristics noted in the work of many authors who are French-English. This family also inherited an intellectual brilliancy which made them a recognized power in U.S. civic and literary history. 

Her great-grandfather, Phineas Dana, a descendant of Joseph Dana, the second son of the original Richard, settled in <a href="Oxford%2C%20Massachusetts">Oxford, Massachusetts</a>. He married Mehitabel Wolcott, of that town, daughter of Josiah Wolcott and his wife Isabella, daughter of the Rev. John Campbell. This eminent divine, who for 40 years was beloved and revered as pastor of the church at Oxford, Mass., was a native of Scotland and a graduate of <a href="Edinburgh%20University">Edinburgh University</a>. An early ancestor of Dana's on the maternal side was Major Thomas Savage, who came from England to Boston in 1633. Of this New England line was James Savage, one of the earliest and most prominent settlers of Augusta, Maine. His wife was Eliza Bickford, of <a href="Alton%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Alton, New Hampshire</a>. Sarah W. Savage, the daughter of James and Eliza Bickford Savage, married James Wolcott Dana, and became the mother of Olive E. Dana.

She graduated from the Augusta, Maine High School in 1877.

Career.
Dana's first published article appeared in 1877. "Under Friendly Eaves" was a volume of short stories. Many of her stories were for children and young people. In addition to her gifts as a story-teller, Dana possessed the poet's instinct and power of interpretation. Her published verses, among them being such poems as "The Summons", "Explanation," "For Light," "Shakespeare's Day," and "It Always Comes," which disclose a deep spiritual insight into nature and humanity, and were widely copied. Dana also contributed to the "Journal of Education", and other similar publications, articles which, with her critical and literary essays and her able book reviews, disclosed a scholarly and cultured mind, originality of thought, and the keen instinct of the critic.

Dana exerted a wide influence in her large circle of friends and among her readers. During the period of 1884-1904, while constantly contributing to the press, Dana was also interested and active in the church and in the philanthropic and educational movements of the day. She was one of the founders of the Current Events Club of Augusta, and served as president for two years. She was also a member of Unity Club; and one of her most poems, "The Laggard Land," was written for a banquet of this literary society.

Near the end of Chen's term, he served as convenor of the Organic Laws and Statues Committee.

Trinh Xuan Thanh

Trinh Xuan Thanh (born c. 1966) is a Vietnamese politician and businessman. He is the former head of the state-owned Petrovietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation (a subsidiary of <a href="Petrovietnam">Petrovietnam</a>), and the former Deputy-Chairman of the <a href="H%E1%BA%ADu%20Giang%20Provincial%20People%27s%20Committee">Hậu Giang Provincial People's Committee</a>. He was accused of causing massive losses at the state-owned company and is believed to have run away in September 2016. While in Berlin, as an asylum-seeker, he was allegedly kidnapped and repatriated to Vietnam on 23rd July, 2017, which led Germany to expel a Vietnamese diplomat. He later said on Vietnam television that he had decided to turn himself in to Vietnamese authorities. However, there have been suggestions that this statement was possibly made under duress. 

Early life.
Thanh was born circa 1966 in Hanoi, Vietnam. He graduated from <a href="Hanoi%20Architectural%20University">Hanoi Architectural University</a> in 1990.

Career.
Thanh is a former member of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Vietnam%20%28CPV%29">Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV)</a>.

Thanh began his career in Germany from 1990 to 1995. He later worked for the state-owned company in Vietnam. In 2007, he joined Petrovietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation (PVC). He served as its Chairman from 2009 to 2013. He was subsequently accused of causing $150m in losses at PVC.

Thanh worked for the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Industry%20and%20Trade%20%28Vietnam%29">Ministry of Industry and Trade</a> in <a href="Da%20Nang">Da Nang</a> in 2013. He later served as the Deputy-Chairman of the <a href="H%E1%BA%ADu%20Giang">Hậu Giang</a> Provincial People's Committee.

He was awarded the <a href="Hero%20of%20Labor%20%28Vietnam%29">Hero of Labor</a> in 2011.

Kidnapping or turning himself in?
The Ministry of Public Security issued a statement on the 31st of July, 2017 saying that Thanh had turned himself to the police following accusations against him of causing massive losses at his previous employer . The Ministry of Public Security issued an international arrest warrant for him in September 2016. It was not known where Trinh Xuan Thanh has been hiding since he left Vietnam . It is also not clear exactly how or when Thanh returned to Vietnam. 

On hearing of Thanh's reappearance in Vietnam, the editor of the Vietnamese online newspaper, Thoibao.de in Germany, Mr Lê Trung Khoa, contacted Thanh's lawyer, the police and the state prosecutor in Berlin. He then announced in a video conference with the BBC News on the same day that Thanh was abducted at about 10h40' on July the 23rd in <a href="Tiergarten%20%28park%29">Tiergarten park</a> in Berlin with a female employee of Vietnam’s foreign trade office, allegedly by armed men from Vietnam's secret service and bundled into the back of a car. 

The next day, the first of August, the German newspaper TAZ gave further details: Thanh had previously sought political asylum at the beginning of 1990s but had returned voluntarily to Vietnam in 1995, and, despite the fact that there was an international arrest warrant for him issued in September 2016 by the Ministry of Public Security of Vietnam, he was not persued because the claim "violating vietnamese law" was not considered concrete enough. 

A day later, the German foreign ministry confirmed the kidnapping, blaming the Vietnamese intelligence service and the Vietnamese Embassy in Germany, for what it called "an unprecedented and glaring breach of German and international law". In response, they ordered a Vietnamese intelligence officer from the Vietnamese Embassy in Berlin to leave Germany within 48 hours and demanded that Thanh be allowed to return immediately to allow the Vietnamese authorities to apply for his extradition and to allow his application for asylum to be examined. Germany also said it was considering other measures against Vietnam. 

On the 3rd August 2017, Thanh appeared on Vietnamese television on and said he had returned to Vietnam voluntarily; however, his asylum lawyer suggested he may have said this under duress. Vietnam's Foreign Ministry in a press conference expressed regret over a statement from Germany accusing Vietnam of kidnapping him. 

Foreign Minister <a href="Sigmar%20Gabriel">Sigmar Gabriel</a> said on the 4th of August, and repeated in an interview with Bärbel Krauss, "I want to say this quite clearly: under no circumstances will we tolerate this kind of thing. Nor will we let it go...But we reserve the right to take further measures if necessary...But obviously we cannot simply go back to business as usual, as if nothing had happened."

Family Fairness

Family Fairness was a program run by the <a href="Immigration%20and%20Naturalization%20Services">Immigration and Naturalization Services</a> in the United States from late 1987 to late 1990. The initial version was introduced in late 1987 by then INS Commissioner <a href="Alan%20C.%20Nelson">Alan C. Nelson</a>, working under then Attorney General <a href="Edwin%20Meese">Edwin Meese</a> and then President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. An expansion of the program was introduced in early 1990 by INS Commissioner <a href="Gene%20McNary">Gene McNary</a> working under then Attorney General <a href="Dick%20Thornburgh">Dick Thornburgh</a> and then United States President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>. The program was created through executive action, in order to meet the problem of "split-eligibility" families created by the <a href="Immigration%20Reform%20and%20Control%20Act%20of%201986">Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986</a>, pending legislation that would address the issue. The <a href="Immigration%20Act%20of%201990">Immigration Act of 1990</a> replaced it with a legislatively sanctioned Family Unity Program, that continues to be in force today.

History.
Background.
On November 6, 1986, then-United States President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> signed the Simpson-Mazzoli <a href="Immigration%20Reform%20and%20Control%20Act%20of%201986">Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986</a>. The Act was the result of a bill sponsored by <a href="Romano%20L.%20Mazzoli">Romano L. Mazzoli</a>, a Democratic representative from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="Alan%20K.%20Simpson">Alan K. Simpson</a>, a Republican senator from <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, who chaired their respective immigration subcommittees in Congress. The effort was assisted by the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by Rev. <a href="Theodore%20Hesburgh">Theodore Hesburgh</a>, then President of the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a>. The bill was passed after several iterations and required compromises between growers' groups, the <a href="U.S.%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a>, civil rights advocates, and politicians' interest in cracking down on illegal immigration.

Two important classes of people that the Act granted temporary legal status and a path to permanent residency were:


At the time of the passage of the Act, it was estimated that 3 million people would be eligible to legalize based on these provisions, although the number would rise later. However, the IRCA provided no special provision for legalization for the spouses and children of eligible people if they did not independently qualify; they would have to "wait in line"; however, they might eventually become eligible once the originally eligible applicant had acquired permanent residency or citizenship.

This led to a problem of "split-eligibility" families, where some members of the family were eligible for temporary legal status and others were not. The issue was highlighted by the <a href="National%20Conference%20of%20Catholic%20Bishops">National Conference of Catholic Bishops</a>, that asked President Ronald Reagan to address the issue. The <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> Catholic Archdiocese estimated that 30% of the legalization applications it was assisting involved split-eligibility families. Los Angeles Archbishop <a href="Roger%20Mahony">Roger Mahony</a> wrote a strongly worded letter to INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson urging him to address the problem of split eligibility by making spouses and children of eligible people eligible, and capping fees for individuals at $50 and total fees for families at $100.

To address this, <a href="John%20Chafee">John Chafee</a>, a Republican Senator (and former Governor) from <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> proposed an amendment to an unrelated bill that would give spouses and children of IRCA-eligible individuals a path to legalization. The amendment was defeated by a 55-45 vote, and was the subject of criticism by Alan Simpson (co-sponsor of the original IRCA) who said that the amendment was against the spirit of the original legislation and the careful balance it had struck.

First announcement.
Until the announcement of the Family Fairness executive action, the INS interpreted the IRCA strictly: only people who were eligible according to the IRCA rules were provided temporary legal status. On October 21, 1987, <a href="Alan%20C.%20Nelson">Alan C. Nelson</a>, Commissioner of the <a href="Immigration%20and%20Naturalization%20Services">Immigration and Naturalization Services</a> at the time, announced the "Family Fairness" executive action. Nelson was working under Attorney General <a href="Edwin%20Meese">Edwin Meese</a> and President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. The executive action allowed for deferred deportation for:


While precise estimates of the impact of the executive action were not available, both the INS and Hispanic groups such as the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20La%20Raza">National Council of La Raza</a> agreed that it would likely affect upward of 100,000 families.

In testimony before the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson clarified that no information in the application would be used to initiate deportation proceedings or used in any way against the applicant.

A number of people thought that the executive action did not go far enough, including Representative <a href="Howard%20Berman">Howard Berman</a>, future INS Commissioner <a href="Doris%20Meissner">Doris Meissner</a>, and United States Catholic Conference immigration lawyer Gilbert Paul Carrasco.

Legislative efforts to block the deportation of spouses and children of IRCA-eligible individuals would continue to stumble for the next few years.

Second announcement.
On February 2, 1990, INS Commissioner <a href="Gene%20McNary">Gene McNary</a>, working under Attorney General <a href="Dick%20Thornburgh">Dick Thornburgh</a> and newly elected President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, announced a significant liberalization of the Family Fairness program, effective February 14. The liberalized program would prevent the deportation of most spouses and children of legalized individuals. Specifically, spouses and children of a legalized alien were eligible for relief from deportation if:


McNary clarified that for a spouse to be eligible, the marriage must have occurred before November 6, 1986. He also said that children over 18, though not eligible for this program, would most likely not be deported, and would continue to receive <a href="voluntary%20departure%20%28United%20States%29">voluntary departure</a> and work authorization.

Superseding by Family Unity Program.
The <a href="Immigration%20Act%20of%201990">Immigration Act of 1990</a> included a Family Unity Program (Section 301 of the Act), effective October 1, 1991, that legislatively superseded the Family Fairness Program. The Family Unity Program continues to be active as of 2017.

Comparison with later deferred action by Obama.
The Family Fairness program has been compared with executive actions by President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, specifically <a href="Deferred%20Action%20for%20Parents%20of%20Americans">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans</a> (abbreviated DAPA, announced November 20, 2014). The Obama administration, as well as some groups supportive of Obama's deferred action have argued in favor of the similarities, in order to make the case that Obama's deferred action has precedent. FactCheck, describing the argument, said: "We can’t speak to whether these actions by previous presidents provide legal precedence for Obama’s actions."

On the other hand, Josh Blackman has argued that the Reagan/Bush Family Fairness program differed from Obama's actions in a critical way: the Family Fairness program only provided a "bridge" for people who could eventually qualify for legal status based on already-existing or in-process legislation, whereas Obama's deferred action provided protections for people who did not have any path to legal status with existing legislation.

White Monopoly Capital

White Monopoly Capital is a phrase which entered <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>n space in 2016.
On 19 March 2017, the South African "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times%20%28South%20Africa%29">Sunday Times</a>" alleged that <a href="Bell%20Pottinger">Bell Pottinger</a> was behind a social media strategy, using fake bloggers, commentators and <a href="Twitter">Twitter users</a> , in an attempt to influence public opinion and sow racial division in South Africa, as well as targeting media and personalities that were opposed to the <a href="Gupta%20family">Gupta family</a> .

The Bell Pottinger campaign.
The aim of the campaign was to portray the <a href="Gupta%20family">Gupta family</a> as victims of a conspiracy involving 'white monopoly capital' to deflect accusations and evidence of their client's involvement in corruption and <a href="state%20capture">state capture</a>, and to suggest that ‘white monopoly capital’ is actively blocking transformation in South Africa.

The allegations were denied by Victoria Geoghegan, a partner and director at <a href="Bell%20Pottinger">Bell Pottinger</a>. On 12 April 2017, it was reported that Bell Pottinger had dropped the Gupta family as a client, having previously been paid around £100,000 per month, reportedly citing "threatening" social media attacks and "insulting" allegations that it had incited racial tensions.

Stephen Grootes interview.
An exclusive and secret interview by South African reporter Stephen Grootes with Ajay Gupta was facilitated by Bell Pottinger on 22 November 2016.

The Guptaleaks.
Pottinger's involvement with the Gupta Family was further highlighted in June 2017 when South African newspapers "The Citizen" and "Sunday Times" published several emails, allegedly between South African President <a href="Jacob%20Zuma">Jacob Zuma</a>'s son, <a href="Duduzane%20Zuma">Duduzane Zuma</a> (and a close Gupta comrade) and Bell Pottinger, pointing to a ‘dirty’ public relations smear battle. They proposed that Hamza Farooqui (MD of WorldSpace in South Africa, and a partner to Gupta associate Salim Essa) would blame the former South African Deputy Finance Minister, Mr <a href="Mcebisi%20Jonas">Mcebisi Jonas</a>, of dishonesty and corruption. This alleged ‘dirty’ statement was formed by Bell Pottinger employee, Nick Lambert. The statement was earmarked for release soon after Mr Jonas said that he was offered a bribe by a Gupta family member to betray his boss, Pravin Gordhan. Mr Jonas denied this bribe and instead made a public announcement. The ‘dirty’ statement was never released after legal concerns were raised by Bell Pottinger's Victoria Geoghegan. Nick Lambert, senior advisor at Bell Pottinger, was also said to have prepared "key moments" for a speech by <a href="African%20National%20Congress%20Youth%20League">ANC Youth League</a> leader Collen Maine. The speech included a quote "Those who want to disrupt the State of the Nation speech must prepare themselves for a civil war." Bell Pottinger initially denied any allegations of wrongdoing.

The consequences for Bell Pottinger.
Bell Pottinger founder <a href="Timothy%20Bell%2C%20Baron%20Bell">Lord Bell</a> was said to have "left his own firm with key staff members, in apparent disgust over the plan"; Bell confirmed in July 2017 that the Oakbay actions had been a factor in his August 2016 departure.

In June 2017 the South Africa's <a href="Democratic%20Alliance%20%28South%20Africa%29">Democratic Alliance</a> criticised the country’s tourism board for working with Bell Pottinger "at the same time as the Guptas were paying them [Bell Pottinger] to sow division in South Africa" (the tourist board contract had been terminated, with the board denying this was for political reasons). The Democratic Alliance also complained about Bell Pottinger's actions to two UK PR bodies, the <a href="Public%20Relations%20and%20Communications%20Association">Public Relations and Communications Association</a> (PRCA) and the <a href="Chartered%20Institute%20of%20Public%20Relations">Chartered Institute of Public Relations</a>. DA spokesperson Phumzile Van Damme said Bell Pottinger tried to divide and conquer South Africans by abusing racial tensions in a bid to keep controversial South African President Jacob Zuma and his party, the <a href="African%20National%20Congress">African National Congress</a> (ANC), in power despite ongoing reports of "State Capture" by the <a href="Gupta%20family">Gupta family</a>. On 4 July, the PRCA acknowledged receipt of the Democratic Alliance's complaint, and on 13 July said it had also received written observations in response from Bell Pottinger.

History of the phrase.
White Monopoly Capital is a phrase that entered the South African space in 2016.
On 30 June 2017, Bell Pottinger announced that it was hiring <a href="Herbert%20Smith%20Freehills">Herbert Smith Freehills</a> to review its dealing with Oakbay Investments in light of the allegations made against Bell Pottinger that it intentionally aggravated racial tensions in South Africa in an effort to deflect attention away from its client. On 6 July 2017 Bell Pottinger CEO James Henderson issued an apology and announced that it had "dismissed the lead partner involved [in the Oakbay portfolio] and suspended another partner and two employees so that [they] can determine their precise role in what took place." This came following initial findings from the Herbert Smith Freehills investigation.
The dismissed lead partner was Victoria Geoghegan.

The phrase ‘white monopoly capital’ has been used many times by South African politicians. It is not known who or what the phrase actually refers to and its existence is disputed (by former South African finance minister Trevor Manual, for example). However, activists including <a href="Pieter%20Bosch%20Botha">Pieter Bosch Botha</a> and <a href="Black%20First%20Land%20First">Black First Land First</a> argue that, despite Bell Pottinger's campaign, 'white monopoly capital' does exist in modern day South Africa. Black First Land First founder, Andile Mngxitama, even blamed 'white monopoly capital' for a severe storm that hit Cape Town in June 2017.

The songs on the album were recorded in a single night with the intent of being released as an album. In his memoir "Special Deluxe", Young described the session, "It was a complete piece, although I was pretty stony on it, and you can hear it in my performances... I laid down all the songs in a row, pausing only for weed, beer, or coke. Briggs was in the control room, mixing live on his favorite console." Many of the songs surfaced on previous Young albums "<a href="American%20Stars%20%27n%20Bars">American Stars 'n Bars</a>", "<a href="Decade%20%28Neil%20Young%20album%29">Decade</a>", "<a href="Comes%20a%20Time">Comes a Time</a>", "<a href="Rust%20Never%20Sleeps">Rust Never Sleeps</a>", "<a href="Hawks%20%26amp%3B%20Doves">Hawks & Doves</a>", and "<a href="Le%20Noise">Le Noise</a>", albeit in different forms. "Hitchhiker" also contains a pair of never-before-released songs: "Hawaii" and "Give Me Strength," which Young has occasionally performed live.

Critical reception.
Writing for <a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>, Josh Modell gave the album a B+ rating and called it a "fantastic" artifact of Young's fruitful 1970's songwriting period. Additionally, Modell praised the "naked and intimate" sound of "Pocahontas" and "Powderfinger" and concluded, "If the bottom of the barrel sounds this good, [Young] should keep 'em coming."

<doc id="54743877" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54743877" title="Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy">
Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy

The Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy is an award for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing by a surface vessel, one of several such awards that have grown out of the contest for the prestigious <a href="Blue%20Riband">Blue Riband ot the Atlantic</a>.
The trophy was created following <a href="Richard%20Branson">Richard Branson</a>'s record-breaking Atlantic crossing in 1986 and the refusal by the American Merchant Marine Museum to surrender the <a href="Hales%20Trophy">Hales Trophy</a>, the then only official award for the Atlantic crossing record. The Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy is currently held by the <a href="Aga%20Khan%20IV">Aga Khan</a>'s vessel, "<a href="Destriero">Destriero</a>".

Background.
The Blue Riband of the Atlantic was a contest between Atlantic passenger shipping companies and their express liners to achieve the fastest average speed on a commercial crossing. The contest was unofficial, involving no set rules or tangible award, and was undertaken for the prestige the accolade brought. In 1935 British businessman <a href="Harold%20Hales">Harold Hales</a> created the Hales Trophy as a means of regularizing the contest, though the trophy's actual history is chequered. It passed to the owners of several express liners, though not to <a href="Cunard">Cunard</a>, owner of the record-breaking "<a href="RMS%20Queen%20Mary">Queen Mary</a>", and was won in 1952 by the American Lines liner "<a href="SS%20United%20States">United States</a>". Thereafter the competition lapsed, and "United States" herself was laid up in 1969. 

In 1985 British entrepreneur Richard Branson's attempt to break the "United States"s record and win the Blue Riband led to the building of "Virgin Atlantic Challenger", which failed in a crossing in July of that year. In 1986. a second attempt by Branson, in " Virgin Atlantic Challenger II", set a new speed record, but the <a href="American%20Merchant%20Marine%20Museum">American Merchant Marine Museum</a> refused to surrender the Hales Trophy, claiming "Challenger" was not a commercial passenger ship. Undaunted, Branson had a new trophy made, making it a challenge trophy open to any who could beat "Virgin Atlantic Challenger's" record.

The trophy.
The Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy is a three foot silver sculpture, modelled on the <a href="Bishop%20Rock%20Lighthouse">Bishop Rock Lighthouse</a>, chosen as the finishing line for many of the Blue Riband crossings, and of the successful 1986 voyage. The model depicts the lighthouse and the rock itself.

History.
Branson's first attempt on the record, in 65ft twin-hull " Virgin Atlantic Challenger", departed New York in June 1985. After surviving rough weather and he threat of late icebergs "Challenger" was fatally damaged 100 miles from Bishops Rock, the intended finishing line, and sank in heavy seas. All the crew were saved.
The following year, in a new craft, the 72ft monohull " Virgin Atlantic Challenger II", Branson completed the crossing in three days, eight hours and 31 minutes, averaging just under 36 <a href="Knot%20%28unit%29">knots</a>; he thus shaved two hours and nine minutes off the time set by "United States" in 1952. Branson had unfurled a six foot blue pennant to mark the achievement, and announced “we are throwing down the gauntlet for anyone else to make a transatlantic challenge and beat it”, but the AMMM later derided his achievement, referring to "Challenger" as “a little toy boat”. In response to this Branson decided to commission the new trophy, open to all challengers.

In 1988 a new challenge was planned by Paolo Vitelli, in a 100ft monohull, "Azimut Atlantic Challenger", but this attempt came to nothing.

The same year American businessman <a href="Tom%20Gentry">Tom Gentry</a> made an attempt in his 110 ft powerboat "Gentry Eagle", but she was damaged by heavy seas off Newfoundlland and forced to turn back. Gentry's aim was to “bring blue riband home”, which he achieved the following year. His second attempt in July 1989 saw "Gentry Eagle" cross the line in 62 hours 7 minutes, at an average speed of 47.4 knots, exceeding Branson's record by almost a quarter. Gentry was met at <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%2C%20Isles%20of%20Scilly">St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly</a>, by Branson and warmly congratulated; he subsequently received the trophy to mark his achievement. 

In 1991 it was reported that three challengers were under construction; a new boat, "Eagle II" from Gentry, "North East Spirit" from <a href="Richard%20Noble">Richard Noble</a>, the land speed record holder, and "<a href="Destriero">Destriero</a>", from the <a href="Aga%20Khan%20IV">Aga Khan</a>. 
In the event, only "Destriero" made the crossing, setting a new record with an average speed of 53 knots (the time was not comparable, as the route taken, from <a href="Tarifa%2C%20Spain">Tarifa, Spain</a> to New York, was longer).

Despite rumours of new challengers with radical hull designs "Destriero"s record remains unbroken.

"The fair, celestial set of Tali Itzhaki, with sown angels, and silhouettes of Cherubim and Seraphim placed on stage, is wonderful", wrote critic Giora Manor at the daily "Al Hamishmar" ; and Amir Orian writes in the weekly "Ha'ir":"The set of Tali Itzhaki is simple and serves well the basic approach of the production. Yet it is also impressive in its beauty in the combined placement of the various figures of Lilith in shades of red against a white background."

On her design for "The Pledge of Troth" at the <a href="Acco%20Festival%20of%20Alternative%20Israeli%20Theatre">Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre</a> and The Library Theatre, <a href="Maariv%20%28newspaper%29">Maariv (newspaper)</a> reviewer Sarit Fuchs has written: " "The Pledge of Troth"… turned, owing to a beautiful classical stage fermentation, into a sensual experience, a dream experience… The sea of Jaffa – one of the central symbols of the story – the symbol of sub conscience, passion, lunacy, was created by designer Tali Itzhaki as a beautiful backdrop, serving as a reflection of the mental world of the the characters, who are gradually engulfed and imprisoned by their madness. The sea, like the entire stage, moves between a shining Israeli light of consciousness, and a Norwegian or Swedish darkening, of a sub conscience remindful of Ibsen, Bergman, or <a href="Edvard%20Munch">Edvard Munch</a>"

And on the production of <a href="Inherit%20the%20Wind%20%28play%29">Inherit the Wind</a>, which she designed at the <a href="Haifa%20Theatre">Haifa Theatre</a>, theatre critic Elyakim Yaron wrote in the same paper: "It is impossible to imagine Gazit's direction of the play, especially in those parts in which a huge theatrical and spectacular momentum is required, without his fertile cooperation with his stage designer, Tali Itzhaki. Her impressive stage design indeed enables a show of such theatrical extension. Her design succeeded to create a magnificent integration of that atmosphere of distinct American background, and a clear conception of a huge and impressive space. The aesthetic neatness of the set, which wonderfully combines the brown wooden colors with the classical white structure of columns and banisters, is a delight for the eye. And indeed the director uses this framework well, when he sits on the upper balconies the town's citizents attending the trial. And this excellent stage picture is yet complemented by the beautiful costumes."

Manor of Broad Hempston

The <a href="manor">manor</a> of Broad Hempston (anciently Great Hempston, Hempston Cauntelow) was an historic <a href="manor">manor</a> situated in Devon, England, about 4 miles north of <a href="Totnes">Totnes</a>. The present village known as <a href="Broadhempston">Broadhempston</a> was the chief settlement within the manor and remains the location of the ancient parish church of St Peter and St Paul.

Descent of the manor.
Domesday Book.
The manor is listed in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> of 1086 as "Hamistone" (later called Hempston Cantilupe, later Broad Hempston), the 43rd of the 79 Devonshire holdings of <a href="Robert%2C%20Count%20of%20Mortain">Robert, Count of Mortain</a>, 2nd <a href="Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Earl of Cornwall</a> (–1090) <a href="Uterus">uterine</a> <a href="Sibling%23Half">half-brother</a> and a major <a href="Devon%20Domesday%20Book%20tenants-in-chief">Devon Domesday Book tenants-in-chief</a> of King <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>. His tenant was Hamelin. It was situated within <a href="Haytor%20hundred">Haytor hundred</a>.

Cantilupe.
In the <a href="Book%20of%20Fees">Book of Fees</a> (pre-1302) it was held by <a href="William%20de%20Cantilupe%20%28died%201254%29">William III de Cantilupe</a> (d.1254), <a href="Feudal%20barony%20of%20Totnes">feudal baron of Totnes</a> in Devon seated at <a href="Totnes%20Castle">Totnes Castle</a> about 4 miles south of Broadhempston, and <a href="Feudal%20barony%20of%20Eaton%20Bray">feudal baron of Eaton Bray</a> in Bedfordshire, either <a href="Tenant-in-chief">in-chief</a> from the <a href="English%20feudal%20barony">honour</a> of Mortain or from the <a href="Earldom%20of%20Cornwall">Earldom of Cornwall</a>. From this family's name the manor gained a suffix to become "Hempston Cauntelow", as did several other manors in England, for example <a href="Aston%20Cantlow">Aston Cantlow</a> in Warwickshire. The church of Broad Hempston was given by William de Cantilupe to <a href="Studley%20Priory%2C%20Warwickshire">Studley Priory</a> in Warwickshire (of which the Cantilupe family were patrons), to whom the <a href="tithes">great tithes</a> were appropriated.

He was the son and heir of William II de Cantilupe (d.1251) by his wife Millicent ("alias" Maud) de Gournai, daughter of Hugh de Gournai and widow of Amaury de Montfort (d.1210/13), Earl of Gloucester and Count of Évreux. In 1238 William II de Cantilupe was granted the wardship and marriage of Eva de Braose (d.1255), one of the daughters and co-heiresses of <a href="William%20de%20Braose%20%28died%201230%29">William de Braose</a> (d.1230), Lord of Abergavenny and feudal baron of Totnes. He thus married off Eva de Braose to his son <a href="William%20de%20Cantilupe%20%28died%201254%29">William III de Cantilupe</a> (d.1254), who thereby inherited the Braose lands, including a <a href="moiety%20title">moiety</a> of the feudal baron of Totnes.

The male line died out on the death of <a href="George%20de%20Cantilupe">George de Cantilupe</a> (1252–1273) <a href="Baron%20Bergavenny">Lord of Abergavenny</a> (son of William III de Cantilupe (d.1254)), whose two sisters were heirs to most of his lands, including the feudal baron of Totnes, but not seemingly to Hempston, which according to <a href="William%20Pole%20%28antiquary%29">Pole</a> (d.1635), descended to Eleanor Cantilupe, great-niece of William III de Cantilupe (d.1254). <a href="Tristram%20Risdon">Risdon</a> (d.1640) states that Eleanor Cantilupe's grandfather was ""John de Cantalupe, a younger son of the Lord Cantalupe, (who) was made baron of Hempston and called to Parliament in King Edward I's age, who had issue Nicholas Lord Cantalupe of Hempston, whose daughter Eleanor being married unto Sir Thomas West, brought his inheritance into that family"".

West.
Eleanor Cantilupe, heiress of Hempston, married Sir Thomas West (1251-1344) and Hempston became the inheritance of their descendants, created <a href="Baron%20De%20La%20Warr">Barons De La Warr</a>. A later Baron De la Warre sold the manor to the Rowe family. The family is today represented by the Sackville family (until 1871 "Sackville-West") of <a href="Buckhurst%20Park%2C%20Sussex">Buckhurst Park, Sussex</a>, Baron De la Warr, Viscount Cantelupe, Baron Buckhurst and <a href="Earl%20De%20La%20Warr">Earl De La Warr</a>, which <a href="Quartering%20%28heraldry%29">quarters</a> the arms of Cantilupe in the second quarter.

Rowe.
Hempston was purchased from the West family by John Rowe (1509-1592) of <a href="Kingston%2C%20Staverton">Kingston</a> in the parish of <a href="Staverton%2C%20Devon">Staverton</a>, Devon, whose <a href="monumental%20brass">monumental brass</a> survives at Staverton Church. He was the son and heir of John Rowe (d. 1544) of Kingston, <a href="serjeant-at-law">serjeant-at-law</a>. It remained a possession of the Rowe family for several generations. A branch of the Rowe family lived at Bearton, within the parish of Broad Hempston, for nearly two and a half centuries. <a href="Giles%20Hussey">Giles Hussey</a> (1710–1788), the artist who adopted the theory of drawing his portraits according to musical or harmonic proportion, resided some years at Bearton with his nephew Mr. Rowe (d. pre-1822) and died there in 1788 and was buried at Broad Hempston Church. Giles Hussey had inherited an ancient family estate in Dorset, which he bequeathed to his nephew Mr. Rowe of Bearton, who in compliance with the bequest adopted the surname Hussey. In 1822 Bearton was the property of his widow, and was occupied as a farm-house.

Martin.
As recorded in the <a href="Heraldic%20Visitation">Heraldic Visitation</a> of Devon in 1620, the occupant in 1620 was William II Martin "of Hempston Cauntelow" son and heir of William I Martin (d.1610) of Totnes (son and heir of Thomas Martin (d.1588) of Salisbury, Wiltshire, <a href="Mayor%20of%20Totnes">Mayor of Totnes</a> by his wife Christiana Savery, a daughter of Richard Savery of Totnes) by his wife Joane Rashleigh, a daughter of John Rashleigh of Foye in Cornwall. William II Martin married twice and had progeny by each wife: firstly to Anne Huckmore (d.1616) daughter of Richard Huckmore of Berry Pomeroy; secondly to his cousin Dorothie Savery, a daughter of Christopher savery, <a href="Mayor%20of%20Totnes">Mayor of Totnes</a> in 1593 and <a href="Sheriff%20of%20Devon">Sheriff of Devon</a> in 1620. In the year 1618 Robert Gunsley, Rector of Titsey in Surrey, gave the parsonage of Broad Hempston, with all lands and tithes thereto belonging, to the towns of <a href="Rochester">Rochester</a> and <a href="Maidstone">Maidstone</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, specifying that a <a href="Moiety%20title">moiety</a> of the produce was to be distributed in bread, among the poor of the several parishes of each town.

Champion.
It was sold by the Rowe family (sic, Risdon) to Joseph Champion (d. pre-1779) of Northleigh House. A deed dated 1779 survives recording the sale by his four children of lands in Broadhempston to <a href="Sir%20John%20Duntze%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Duntze, 1st Baronet</a>, catalogued as follows:

Duntze.

Charles Shirreff (painter)

Charles Shirreff (–1829) was a <a href="deaf%20culture">deaf</a> Scottish painter, specializing in <a href="portrait%20miniature">portrait miniature</a>s.

Early life and education.
Charles Shirreff was born in either 1749 or 1750. His last name has, at times, been spelled as Sherrif, Sherriff, or Shirref. His father, Alexander Shirreff, was a wealthy wine merchant of <a href="Leith">South Leith</a> in Edinburgh. 

At the age of three or four, Shirreff became <a href="deaf-mute">deaf and mute</a>. In 1760, his father approached <a href="Thomas%20Braidwood">Thomas Braidwood</a>, owner of a school of mathematics in Edinburgh, seeking an education for the boy, then ten years old, in the hope that he could be taught to write. Charles became Braidwood's first deaf student; soon afterward, Braidwood founded Braidwood's Academy for the Deaf and Dumb, the first school of its kind in Britain. 

At the age of 18, in August 1769, Shirreff left Braidwood's Academy to study art in London at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Schools">Royal Academy Schools</a>. He graduated in 1772 with a silver medal, and took up a career as a <a href="portrait%20miniature">miniaturist</a>.

Professional career.
In addition to painting <a href="portrait%20miniature">portrait miniature</a>s, Shirreff also produced <a href="pastel">pastel</a>s in his early years. Shirreff successfully exhibited oil paintings, pastels, and pencil drawings at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> in 1771, and at the <a href="Free%20Society%20of%20Artists">Free Society of Artists</a> from 1770 until 1773.

Shirreff worked in London after graduating from the Royal Academy, building up a clientele that was mainly theatrical. He befriended <a href="Caleb%20Whitefoord">Caleb Whitefoord</a>, a well-connected Scottish merchant, diplomat, and political satirist who moved in London's wealthiest elite circles, where Shirreff developed advantageous associations with portraitists Sir <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Joshua Reynolds</a>, <a href="George%20Dance%20the%20Younger">George Dance the younger</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Cosway">Richard Cosway</a>.

After Shirreff's father had been financially ruined in the <a href="Crisis%20of%201772">Crisis of 1772</a> by the failure of banking house <a href="Neal%2C%20James%2C%20Fordyce%20and%20Down">Neal, James, Fordyce and Down</a>, Shirreff supported the family with his work. He applied to go to India in 1778, stating in his application to the East India Company that he had no speech but was able to make himself understood by signs. He requested that he be accompanied by his father and his sister Mary to act as interpreters. However, his original plan to visit India was abandoned and he remained in England for two more decades.

Shirreff reportedly taught miniature painting in London to students that included, in 1786–1788, Scottish miniaturist <a href="Archibald%20Robertson%20%28painter%29">Archibald Robertson</a>.

Shirreff lived and worked in <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> either from 1791 to 1795, or from to 1800.. His sitters included actress <a href="Sarah%20Siddons">Sarah Siddons</a>, who wrote of him as more successful in her portrait than any miniature painter she had sat to. During that period, he had clients for portraits in common with two other deaf miniaturists in Bath, <a href="Sampson%20Towgood%20Roch">Sampson Towgood Roch</a> and <a href="Richard%20Crosse">Richard Crosse</a>.
In 1795, he renewed his application to go to India, and left England in the "Lord Hawkesbury", which reached <a href="Madras">Madras</a> in January 1797. He painted in Madras for some years before moving to <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, where he worked on his "Illustrations of Signs". In 1807, he announced it was nearly completed and would be available to subscribers as soon as possible. This work has never been traced and is presumed lost in passage from India.

He returned from India in 1808 or 1809, and again took up residence in London, where he continued to work.

Shirreff's date of death, often given as or 1831, has been contested. More recent biographies give an earlier year of death, based on 1829 <a href="probate">probate</a> records showing that Shirreff must have died prior to 5 November 1829, when his <a href="will%20and%20testament">will</a> was <a href="probate">proved in court</a>.

IC 2395

IC 2395 is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> in the constellation <a href="Vela%20%28constellation%29">Vela</a>.

Observation history.
It is possible that entry III.3 of the catalogue of <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a>, often listed as missing, is IC 2395. According to Lacaille's entry, the object consists of a "Star of 6th magnitude, connected to another more southern one by a nebulous trace", and gives the coordinates RA=08:42.2, Dec=-48:04. These coordinates are 2' west and 1' south of the location of van den Bergh-Hagen 47 according to Sky Catalogue 2000.0, which is within the cluster's diameter. Lacaille observed it on February 17, 1752.

The cluster was discovered independetly in 1908 by <a href="Solon%20Irving%20Bailey">Solon Irving Bailey</a>. <a href="Sidney%20van%20den%20Bergh">Sidney van den Bergh</a> and Gretchen Luft Hagen catalogue also this cluster in 1975. The coordinates of vdBH 47 are in fair agreement with the coordinates of IC 2395, although because Lund placed IC 2395 in an inaccurate position, Sky Catalogue 2000.0, Deep Sky Field Guide and the first edition of Uranometria list two different clusters. The fact that they are the same cluster is also supported by Clariá et al. who estimated its angular diameter at 19 arcminutes.

Characteristics.
IC 2395 is an open cluster of poor to moderate richness. 45 stars located within the central part of the cluster are considered to be possible members. The radius core radius of the cluster is 0.53 parsecs (1.6 light years), while the tidal radius is 4.5 - 7.9 parsecs (15 - 26 light years) and represents the average outer limit of IC 2395, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. IC 2395 is a young stellar cluster being between 6 and 18 million years old. Based on its young age and distance, it is possible that IC 2395 is part of the Vela OB1C <a href="stellar%20association">stellar association</a>.

The brightest member of the cluster has mag 5.53, and its bluest main sequence star is of spectral type B5. One of the members of the cluster is a candidate <a href="Be%20star">Be star</a>. One member, HD 74339 (mag. 9.3, spectral type B2/3 II/III), is a <a href="beta%20Cephei%20variable">beta Cephei variable</a>.

Halley (film)

Halley is a 2012 mexican <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> directed by <a href="Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Hofmann">Sebastián Hofmann</a> and produced by <a href="Julio%20Chavezmontes">Julio Chavezmontes</a> and Jaime Romandia. It premiered internationally at the 2013 <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a> and was also part of the Hivos Tiger Awards Competition of the <a href="International%20Film%20Festival%20Rotterdam">IFF Rotterdam</a> .

The film follows Alberto, a night guard with a decomposing body who decides to withdraw from the world.

Plot.
Alberto is dead and can no longer hide it. Make-up and perfume can no longer conceal his quickly decomposing body. Dismayed, he decides to withdraw from the world. But before surrendering to his living death, Alberto forms an unusual friendship with Luly, the manager of the 24-hour gym where he works as a night guard.


Production.
Themes.
About the name of the movie, the director <a href="Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Hofmann">Sebastián Hofmann</a> said in an interview with Vice Mexico that when he started thinking about the story for his film, he had a childhood memory of his grandmother asking him to draw <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a>. That happened in 1986, the last time it passed around the Earth. While writing the script for the film in Yucatán, México, he was walking across a town when he saw a newspaper where he read that there was going to be a <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> caused by the cosmic dust trail of Halley's Comet. He thought then that it was to much of a coincidence and called the project like the comet. For the director, Halley is also "a symbol for immortality" since it has being known since the beginnings of astronomy and it orbits around the Sun every 75 years. Hofmann says "it is the eternal witness of our history, with its cycles of upswing and decline. The space between each one of its visits is the duration of a human life."

Release.
The film premiered at the <a href="Morelia%20International%20Film%20Festival">Morelia International Film Festival</a> in November of 2012 and had its world premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. The film was also screened in the International Film Festival Rotterdam, on January 25, 2013.

Critical reception.
For its special treatment of topics as mortality, illness and loneliness, the cinematography and the protagonist performance, Halley gained positive reviews in several media. Marc Saint-Cyr of <a href="Senses%20of%20Cinema">Senses of Cinema</a> praised the film for taking the <a href="zombie">zombie</a> genre into an original territory with a "thoughtful, expertly composed character study". He concluded that "while so many other filmmakers claim they want to bend or break free from overdone zombie movie conventions, Hofmann fearlessly leaves them all behind and emerges with a hauntingly relatable examination of the body, mortality and alienation. Precise and pure, it is a virtually flawless artistic achievement". Mark Adams from <a href="Screen%20Daily">Screen Daily</a> called the movie "a disturbingly stylish and surrealistic drama", with a "strangely compelling story, impressive performances and strange sense of the grotesque".

Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves. 


Swifts.
Order: <a href="Apodiformes">Apodiformes</a>Family: <a href="Apodidae">Apodidae</a>

The swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have very long, swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. 


Hummingbirds.
Order: <a href="Apodiformes">Apodiformes</a>Family: <a href="Trochilidae">Trochilidae</a>

Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards.

Columbus Atlantic Trophy

The Columbus Atlantic Trophy is an award for the fastest non-stop two way crossing of the Atlantic Ocean within a given time period. It was inaugurated in 1992 by <a href="New%20York%20Yacht%20Club">New York Yacht Club</a> in concert with <a href="Costa%20Smeralda%20Yacht%20Club">Costa Smeralda Yacht Club</a> of <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>,

Trophy.
The Columbus Atlantic Trophy is a two-foot silver goblet, which was actually given in 1928 to the NYYC by <a href="King%20Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">King Alfonso XIII of Spain</a>, as the prize for the 1928 trans-Atlantic yacht race won by NYYC's yacht "Elena".
The trophy is available to any vessel that can set a trans-Atlantic record one way, then (within a set time-frame) set the corresponding record back. A further stipulation is that the vessel must travel without stopping, and without re-fuelling en route.

History.
At the time of its inauguration the non-stop east-west record was that set by the American liner "<a href="SS%20United%20States">United States</a>" in July 1952, on her return to the US, crossing in 84 hours 12 minutes at an average speed of 34.51 <a href="knot%20%28unit%29">knots</a>. The west- east record was that of the <a href="SeaCat">SeaCat</a> "<a href="Hoverspeed%20Great%20Britain">Hoverspeed Great Britain</a>" in 1990, crossing in 79 hours 55 minutes at an average of 36.96 knots (and beating "United States" easterly voyage by 2hr 45 min, adding 1.37knots to the average speed).

In 1992 "<a href="Destriero">Destriero</a>" broke both records, crossing east to west (though by a different route, from <a href="Tarifa%2C%20Spain">Tarifa, Spain</a> to New York) and two weeks later returning at an average speed of 53.09 knots. This also beat the unqualified trans-Atlantic record set by "Gentry Eagle" in 1989, which crossed west to east in 62 hour 7 minutes, at an average speed of 47.4 knots. 

This record has not so far been broken.

Hyman Archive

The Hyman Archive is a British archive of popular publications; it is based in <a href="London">London</a>, England.

History.
The archive was established by <a href="James%20Hyman">James Hyman</a>, who for over 30 years has been collecting magazines, pamphlets, newsletters,brochures, <a href="ephemera">ephemera</a> and other printed material. The theme of Hyman's collecting is 'popular culture in print'. Originally, he began collecting to assist his research at <a href="MTV%20Europe">MTV Europe</a>, where he was a script writer and programme producer. This was in a period where, according to Hyman, "magazines were the internet".

The Hyman Archive contains over 4,500 individual title publications and over 120,000 individual issues as at April 2017, although the collection is still growing at approximately 30% per annum. The collection spans the period 1850 to present day. More than 55% of the title publications are not to be found in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>. Independent Publishers represent 75% of the title publications in The Hyman Archive. <a href="Cond%C3%A9%20Nast">Condé Nast</a> and <a href="Bauer%20Media">Bauer Media</a> are the two largest contributors to the Archive, representing 3% each of the total title publications. The United Kingdom represents approximately 55% of the title publications by territory, followed by the United States at 34%. The Hyman Archive, although curated and focused on <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>, includes a broad-array of subject matter, including <a href="Film">Film</a>, <a href="TV">TV</a>, <a href="Music">Music</a>, <a href="Music%20video">Music video</a>, <a href="Art">Art</a>, <a href="Fashion">Fashion</a>, <a href="Architecture">Architecture</a>, <a href="Interior%20design">Interior design</a>, <a href="Fad">Trends</a>, <a href="Youth">Youth</a>, <a href="Lifestyle%20%28sociology%29">Lifestyle</a>, Women's, Men's, <a href="Technology">Technology</a>, <a href="Sports">Sports</a>, <a href="Photography">Photography</a>, <a href="Counter-culture">Counter-culture</a>, <a href="Graphics">Graphics</a>, <a href="Animation">Animation</a>, and <a href="Comics">Comics</a>.

On 1 August 2012, "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>" verified that, ""The largest collection of magazines consists of 50,953 magazines and belongs to James Hyman (UK), in London, UK"". At that time, the collection featured 2,312 unique publications amongst the 50,953 magazines. The process of counting the magazines took approximately 128 days as James and Tory Turk worked their way through 450 crates filled with magazines.

In September 2014, with an investor, Hyman formed The Hyman Archive Ltd. in order to obtain an ECL (a form of <a href="collective%20rights%20management">collective rights management</a>) with copyright holders contained within the collection, and then to digitise and meta-tag the collection, making it available in a commercial offering. Hyman hoped to have secured an ECL by Spring 2016. The company will then begin the process of digitising the collection's approximate 10 million pages.

The archive’s activity has included: a unique "<a href="New%20Musical%20Express">New Musical Express</a>" (NME) loan to the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> for its <a href="Britannia%20series">Britannia series</a> (Pop Charts Britannia: 60 Years of the Top 10); supplying <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a>'s pop-up trainer exhibition; the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>’s 'David Bowie Is'; <a href="Northampton%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Northampton Museum and Art Gallery</a> Mods exhibition, "Fashion Galore!" and "<a href="The%20Jam">The Jam</a>: About The Young Idea", both at <a href="Somerset%20House">Somerset House</a>.

July 2015, <a href="David%20Hepworth">David Hepworth</a>'s 'Off The Page' column for InPublishing opened with, ""We should all support James Hyman’s amazing project to rescue the most ephemeral magazines from oblivion""

The studios on the second floor led to the name of the building. Over time, the second floor space was occupied by photographic studios operated by Arthur Swain, G. T. Stephens, D. C. Moyer, among others up until the 1920. A series of pharmacies occupied the first floor until the 1960s. A fire in 1970 destroyed some of the lower floor trim.

Description.
The Art Gallery Building is a two-story narrow-fronted red brick, Italianate commercial building, with a roof that slants slightly downward toward the back. The building is located adjacent to a small alleyway. The cast iron facade contains an arcade-like set of round-head windows topped by faux masonry. A bracketed iron cornice above has a round-gable center section inset with the building's name and date of construction.
Atop the cornice line are rectangular urns with ball finials.

Scott Dozier (murderer)

Scott Raymond Dozier (born November 20, 1970) is an American criminal who is on death row in Nevada for the 2002 murder of 22-year-old Jeremiah Miller, who was one of Dozier's drug associates. On April 18, 2002, Miller met Dozier at <a href="La%20Concha%20Motel">La Concha</a>, a motel on the <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Strip">Las Vegas Strip</a>. Dozier had promised to help Miller buy <a href="ephedrine">ephedrine</a>, a key ingredient in the production of <a href="Methamphetamine">meth</a>. Miller had brought $12,000 in cash for that express purpose. Upon Miller's arrival at La Concha, Dozier killed him (likely by shooting), sawed Miller's body into multiple pieces, stuffed most of them into a suitcase, and disposed of it near an apartment complex in western Vegas. Dozier was also linked to the 2001 murder of Jasen Green in Arizona, whose remains were found in a plastic container in the desert north of <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a>.

On October 31, 2016, Dozier voluntarily waived his appeals and wrote a letter to District Judge Jennifer Togliatti asking her to expedite his execution. Ten days later, on November 10, the <a href="Nevada%20Department%20of%20Corrections">Nevada Department of Corrections</a> publicly announced the completion of the new <a href="lethal%20injection">lethal injection</a> chamber at <a href="Ely%20State%20Prison">Ely State Prison</a>, following the 2012 closure of the <a href="Nevada%20State%20Prison">Nevada State Prison</a> in <a href="Carson%20City%2C%20Nevada">Carson City</a>, which previously housed the former gas chamber which had been converted to be compatible with lethal injections. The male death row was transferred from Carson City to Ely in September 2011. In a hearing on July 27, 2017, Judge Togliatti signed Dozier's death warrant, permitting his execution to take place "in the week of October 16, 2017". Following a hearing on August 17, 2017, Dozier's execution was pushed back to the week of November 13, 2017. Should Dozier's execution go ahead, it will be the first execution in Nevada since the April 26, 2006 execution of <a href="List%20of%20individuals%20executed%20in%20Nevada">Daryl Mack</a>.

Caroline Dana Howe

Caroline Dana Howe (August 21, 1824 - October 30, 1907) was an American writer of prose, poetry, and hymns. Her celebrated song, "Leaf by Leaf the Roses Fall", was claimed and used by several different authors, until her authorship was reasserted, the publishers appending her name to all later editions. 

A large number of Howe's songs were set to music for which they were easily adapted, and were found in sheet music and in church collections. The songs were gathered into at least 26 collections, and it was said that no living writer in Maine was more favorably known in that day as a writer of songs than Howe. She was also well known as a writer of short serial stories, juvenile sketches, and essays. The Massachusetts Sunday School Society published a book of about 200 pages of hers, carried successfully through several editions.

Early years and education.
Caroline Dana was born in <a href="Fryeburg%2C%20Maine">Fryeburg, Maine</a>, August 21, 1824. She resided in <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a> since early childhood. 

Career.
She lived in her home for more than 30 years, sharing it with the family of her nephew. There, she wrote most of the poems that gave her a position among the leading hymn singers. A <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> critic, in enumerating the eight songs by American women of the day, sung everywhere, called attention to the fact that four of them were written in <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, and one of them, "Leaf by Leaf the Roses Fall," by Howe. This popular song was written by her in 1856, and first published in "Gleasoris Pictorial". A few years later, it appeared in another <a href="Boston">Boston</a> paper, set to music, the composer claiming the words as his own. Several other composers were equally unscrupulous, and it was not until after many years that the question of authorship was finally settled, through the efforts of <a href="Oliver%20Ditson">Oliver Ditson</a>, and proper credit given thereafter by various publishers.

Her first literary work appeared in the "Portland Transcript", and in this, as in other leading publications, her contributions of prose and verse were favorably received by the public. In 1862, the Massachusetts Sunday School Society published in book form a story written by her, which passed through several editions. Her verse was characterized by lyric power, by grace of diction, by religious fervor and aspiration, and a sincere heartiness. It was adapted for music, and more than 30 of her hymns and songs were published in collections for church choirs, and in sheet music, becoming very popular. In 1885, a collection of Howe's poems was made under title of "Ashes for Flame and Other Poems".

She died October 30, 1907.

"Leaf by Leaf the Roses Fall".
Of the poem, "Leaf by Leaf the Roses Fall!" Howe said in 1889: 
<poem>
Leaf by leaf the roses fall,
One by one, beyond recall,
But the roses bloom again.
In the pleasant April rain,
So in hours of deepest gloom,
And the roses in their bloom
We shall find some hope that lies
Hidden far from careless eyes,
Some sweet hope to gladness wed,
When grief's winter shall have fled.
Some sweet hope that breathes of spring,
Budding for its blossoming.

Elizabeth Scott Matheson

Elizabeth Scott Matheson (6 January 1866-15 January 1958) was a Canadian physician, who completed her medical studies in 1898, and though recognized by government as the district doctor, the <a href="College%20of%20Physicians%20and%20Surgeons%20of%20Saskatchewan">Northwest Territories College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> refused to issue her a license. She returned to school and was again refused a license until 1904 when it was finally granted. Having served from 1892 to 1918 at the Onion Lake mission in Saskatchewan, Matheson became the assistant medical officer for the public school system of Winnepeg from 1918 until her retirement in 1941.

Early life.
Elizabeth Beckett Scott was born near <a href="Campbellford%2C%20Ontario">Campbellford, Ontario</a>, <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a> on 6 January 1866 to Elizabeth (née Beckett) and James Scott, who had immigrated from Scotland to Canada. She began her education at the age of four, attending school in <a href="Burnbrae%2C%20Ontario">Burnbrae</a>. In 1878, the family moved to <a href="Morris%2C%20Manitoba">Morris, Manitoba</a>, where Scott completed her primary education. She went on to secondary school, attending high school and <a href="normal%20school">normal school</a> training in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>.

Career.
Upon finishing her studies, Scott began teaching in Winnipeg, but soon her brother Tom convinced her to return to Ontario and found her a position in the Sunnyside School District. In 1885, she met John Matheson, whom she would later marry, but at the time, he was thirty-seven and she was only nineteen, and Scott had reservations about their age difference and his boisterous life. In 1887, she volunteered to work at an orphanage and while there, attended the <a href="Queen%27s%20University">Women's Medical College</a> in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Ontario">Kingston</a> for a year. In 1888, she took a position to teach for seven years in <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a> with the Presbyterian Mission School. Contracting malaria, she returned to Manitoba. In 1891, she married Matheson, who had converted to Christianity and determined to enter missionary work. The following year, the couple were posted at the Anglican mission at <a href="Onion%20Lake%2C%20Saskatchewan">Onion Lake, Saskatchewan</a>.

The Mathesons established a school to teach the children of the area, as well as their own growing family. As the school was not well attended if students were left to make their own way there, the couple boarded them in their own home. By the end of their first year, they had about eighty students living with them. The need for a doctor for their growing household, convinced Matheson to return to medical school and in 1895, she enrolled at the <a href="Manitoba%20Medical%20College">Manitoba Medical College</a>. During her year there, gave birth to her third child. At the end of the school term, she transferred to the <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Toronto">Trinity Medical College for Women</a> where she completed her education and successfully passed her examinations in 1898. She returned to the mission at Onion Lake and served as the area doctor, though the <a href="College%20of%20Physicians%20and%20Surgeons%20of%20Saskatchewan">Northwest Territories College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> refused to issue her a license. Her husband built her a three-storey hospital with a surgical room. In 1901, despite her lack of license, Matheson's care during the <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> epidemic, led the government to recognize her as the district doctor and give her a contract for $300 per year. 

As other physicians began to move into the area, Matheson's unlicensed status prompted her to apply again for approval, but she was rejected. Fearing that she might not be able to pass a licensing examination, in 1903, she returned to the Manitoba Medical College. She completed an additional year's schooling, graduating with a second medical degree in 1904. Still the College of Physicians and Surgeons for the Northwest Territories in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> refused her a license until her husband intervened. Near the end of his life, John became ill and Matheson took over his duties as principal at the school, as well as continuing her own medical practice. He died in 1916 and she would remain at Onion Lake until 1918. She relocated to Winnipeg in that year and took an appointment as the assistant medical inspector to the public schools. She would remain in this post until her retirement in 1941.

Death and legacy.
Matheson died on 15 January 1958 at the home of one of her nine children, Gladys, in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>. In 1974, her biography "The Doctor Rode Side-Saddle" was published by her daughter, Ruth Matheson Buck.

Daniel Webster Debate Society

The Daniel Webster Debate Society is the oldest secondary school student <a href="debate">debate</a> union and literary club in the United States, at <a href="Phillips%20Exeter%20Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a>. Established in 1818 as "The Golden Branch Literary Society", a secret society, the club later changed its name to honor <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>, who attended the Academy. The club's primary focus today is on parliamentary-style debate, with some focus on policy debate and speechmaking.

Name.
The previous name of the society was taken from <a href="The%20Golden%20Bough%20%28mythology%29">The Golden Bough</a> of the <a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a> by <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, VI, i36ff.

History.

It was dissolved in 1820. Professor Hosea Hildreth, the second professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, performed the initiating ceremonies for the Golden Branch, which then elected Charles Soule, the founder, as its first president. On August 19, 1841, the constitution of the society was amended by the trustees of Exeter in order to prevent the students from meeting in secret. In one instance where several students attempted to form a rival society, the club was disbanded and the students were promptly expelled by Principal <a href="Gideon%20Lane%20Soule">Gideon Lane Soule</a>. On June 12, 1878, an address on education was presented to the Golden Branch by <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>. Another rival society, named the Gideon L. Soule Literary Society, was founded on November 19, 1881.

The Ohio Northern Region BBYO (known as ONR BBYO) is a <a href="BBYO">BBYO</a> region based in northern <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>.

ONR originally was named the <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> Council, which was limited to the Cleveland area. The council then became ONR in the 1980's after a change in region size that resulted in the entirety of northern Ohio to become one region, which now included the city of <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo.</a>

ONR as a region strives to follow BBYO's mission statement: "More <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> Teens, More Meaningful Jewish Experiences." The region works together with its 8 <a href="Aleph%20Zadik%20Aleph">AZA</a> and 9 <a href="B%27nai%20B%27rith%20Girls">BBG</a> chapters to create an ONR community that puts emphasis on the importance of things such as <a href="community">community</a> involvement, Jewish enrichment, chapter <a href="fraternity">fraternity</a>/<a href="sorority">sorority</a>, and other basic principals that the BBYO organization encourages.

About ONR.
Early days of ONR.
BBYO started to become organized in the <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> area in the 1940's. During these early days, BBYO was more popular among Jewish teens living in cities with smaller Jewish communities such as <a href="Lorain%2C%20Ohio">Lorain,</a> <a href="Akron%2C%20Ohio">Akron,</a> <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton,</a> <a href="Youngstown%2C%20Ohio">Youngstown,</a> and <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a>, as opposed to areas with large Jewish communities such as the east side of Cleveland. Beginning in the 1950's with <a href="suburbanization">suburbanization</a>, BBYO became a Cleveland staple. At this time, BBYO was most popular in the east side neighborhoods with large Jewish communities such as <a href="East%20Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">East Cleveland,</a> <a href="Cleveland%20Heights%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland Heights,</a> <a href="Shaker%20Heights%2C%20Ohio">Shaker Heights,</a> <a href="University%20Heights%2C%20Ohio">University Heights,</a> <a href="Beachwood%2C%20Ohio">Beachwood,</a> and <a href="Euclid%2C%20Ohio">Euclid</a>.

Functions of ONR.
ONR's color's are red and white.

ONR's mascot is the <a href="Cat%20in%20the%20hat">Cat in the Hat</a>.

ONR follows mainly the same Blue Book/Red Book principals of order for both chapter and regional elections.

ONR has a regional office located in the Mandel <a href="Jewish%20Community%20Center">JCC</a>, with an office staff that works to help teen leaders run chapters and ONR as a region. Currently, ONR has a Regional Director, a Senior Regional Director, and a Regional Director of Connections.

Every year, ONR holds several various conventions and regional events that connect chapters and teens into one regional community. ONR also hosts BBYO Connect, a program aimed at 6th-8th graders to get middle-schoolers involved with BBYO.

Gulshan Lake is a lake in Dhaka that borders <a href="Gulshan%20Thana">Gulshan Thana</a>, <a href="Shahjadpur">Shahjadpur</a>, and <a href="Baridhara%20Diplomatic%20Zone">Baridhara Diplomatic Zone</a>.

History.
On June 2015 <a href="Bangladesh%20High%20Court">Bangladesh High Court</a> ordered the government to free portions of Gulshan lake that had been encroached upon. Since the July 2016 Dhaka attack, all boats have been removed from the lake. The government announced plans to introduce water taxis in the lake. On April 2017, the <a href="Rajdhani%20Unnayan%20Kartripakkha">Capital Development Authority</a> under the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Housing%20and%20Public%20Works">Ministry of Housing and Public Works</a> destroyed a number of structures on the banks of the lake to make way for the building of pathway on the banks of the lake.

Ecology.
The lake has been declared by the city corporation as being "Ecologically Critical Area" in 2001. Direct dumping of sewage and water runoff had increased the pollution of the lake. The lake has also experienced an algal boom which has further reduced the oxygen available, harming the aquatic life.

Charles F. Bretzman

Charles F. Bretzman (July 26, 1867 – January 19, 1934) founded the Bretzman Photo Company, also called the Bretzman Studio, in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, at the turn of the twentieth century and was a noted portrait and commercial photographer in the city for more than thirty years. In addition to operating his own photography studio, Bretzman worked for a few years as a staff photographer for three of Indianapolis's daily newspapers and became the first official photographer of the <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a>-mile automobile race. Bretzman's photographs documented Indianapolis's people, places, and events in the early decades of the twentieth century. His work includes portraits of notable individuals, such as <a href="Hoosier">Hoosier</a> poet <a href="James%20Whitcomb%20Riley">James Whitcomb Riley</a> and <a href="Carl%20G.%20Fisher">Carl G. Fisher</a>, a founder of the <a href="Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a>, as well as photographs of the first Indianapolis 500 race in 1911 and other major events in the city's history.

The <a href="Germany">German</a>-born photographer came to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> in 1885 and traveled across the country for a few years before settling in Indianapolis in 1900 and establishing a photography studio on South Illinois Street. In 1914 he expanded his business to larger quarters on the top floor of the Fletcher Savings and Trust Building. Bretzman's son, C. Noble, and grandson, Erich, also became professional photographers in the family business. The Bretzman Photo Company closed after nearly eighty years in operation when Noble retired from full-time photography in 1976. Bretzman Photo Company photographs are in the collections of the <a href="Indiana%20Historical%20Society">Indiana Historical Society</a> and the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>, among others.

Early life and family.
Charles F. Bretzman was born on July 26, 1866, in <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, and came to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> in 1885 at the age of nineteen. Charles became a naturalized citizen of the United States at Chicago, Illinois, on October 4, 1892.

Charles married his first wife, Catharine, in 1891; she died on May 23, 1904, at Indianapolis. Charles and his second wife, Bertha Grauel, were married on June 8, 1905, in Indianapolis. Charles Bretzman had two sons (Charles "Carl" F. and Charles Noble) and four daughters (Marie, Julia, Rosemary, and Bertha F.).

Charles "Carl" F. Bretzman ( –1958) the son of Charles and Catharine Bretzman, was born in Chicago and worked in his father's photography studio in Indianapolis before moving to the <a href="southern%20United%20States">South</a>; he worked as a professional photographer in the <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>-area.

Charles Noble Bretzman (1909–1986), the son of Charles and Bertha G. Bretzman, became "one of the country's top photographers." A graduate of <a href="Shortridge%20High%20School">Shortridge High School</a> in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, Noble began his career as a journeyman photographer in his father's Indianapolis studio. After high school graduation, Noble took photography classes at a school run by professional photographers at <a href="Winona%20Lake%2C%20Indiana">Winona Lake</a> in <a href="Kosciusko%20County%2C%20Indiana">Kosciusko County, Indiana</a>, before relocating to the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a>. In the early 1930s, when Noble was a professional photographer in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, he became the first public relations photographer for the <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a>.

Noble returned to Indianapolis after his father's death in 1934 to run the family's photography business. He specialized in portraits and commercial photography and brought a contemporary and distinctive photographic style to the city. In his later years, Noble became especially interested in photographing performance art, most notably ballet, and was a cofounding board member of Indianapolis's first professional ballet company and general manager of the Indianapolis Ballet Theatre. Noble also founded Bravo Project, Inc., a not-for-profit organization that encouraged <a href="Marion%20County%2C%20Indiana">Marion County, Indiana</a>, youth in the performing arts.

Career.
Early years.
In his early career, Charles Bretzman worked for several years in large photography companies in New York City and elsewhere in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a> and <a href="eastern%20United%20States">eastern United States</a>. He also engaged in photographic work in <a href="Denver">Denver</a> and <a href="Pueblo%2C%20Colorado">Pueblo, Colorado</a>, as well as other cities in the <a href="western%20United%20States">western United States</a> to gain a broad knowledge of the photography business. By 1894 he had become a partner in Koehne and Bretzman, a photography company in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>.

Indianapolis studio.
In an article appearing in the "<a href="The%20Indianapolis%20Star">Indianapolis Star</a>" on February 9, 1920, Bretzman explained that he arrived in Indianapolis, on February 13, 1900, and worked as a staff photographer for three of Indianapolis's daily newspapers. His earliest photography studio in Indianapolis was located in the heart of the city's business district at that time, at 142 South Illinois Street, where he focused on portrait work and commercial photography. In 1905 Bretzman expanded his studio to larger quarters he had leased on two floors at 22 1/2 North Pennsylvania Street. It was during this time that Bretzman became the first official photographer of the <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a>-mile automobile race.

Bretzman photographed the first Indianapolis 500 race on May 30, 1911, and continued in that role for several years. He also photographed other sporting events held at the <a href="Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a> during the years leading up to its first 500-mile automobile race. These events included a national balloon race held at the Speedway in June 1909, a three-day event in August 1909 that included motorcycle and automobile races, a three-day event in May 1910 that featured forty-two auto races covering distances ranging from five to 200 miles on the Speedway's new brick track, and the first national aviation meet at the Speedway in June 1910.
In 1914 Bretzman relocated his photography business to the Fletcher Savings and Trust Building at 108 North Pennsylvania Street. He planned and designed the studio in leased space on the top floor of the newly-constructed building.

Bretzman believed that photography was "essential" and occupied "an important place in the progress of our business and social activities." He continued to be an active photographer in Indianapolis until his death in 1934. Bretzman was a cofounder and former president of the Indianapolis Photographers Association and a member of the Daguerre Club of Indiana.

Photographic works.
Bretzman made numerous individual and family portraits, as well as photographs of community gatherings, civic and commercial buildings, public monuments, private residences, and city parks. His photographs are represented in the collections of the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.%20C.">Washington, D. C.</a>, as well as the <a href="Indiana%20Historical%20Society">Indiana Historical Society</a>, <a href="Indiana%20University%20%E2%80%93%20Purdue%20University%20Indianapolis">IUPUI</a>, and the <a href="Indiana%20State%20Museum">Indiana State Museum</a> in Indianapolis.

One of Bretzman's most notable pictures was a 360-degree panoramic photograph that he made on May 30, 1907, when <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> visited Indianapolis to dedicate a statue in honor of General <a href="Henry%20Ware%20Lawton">Henry W. Lawton</a>. The "<a href="Indianapolis%20News">Indianapolis News</a>" commissioned Bretzman to make the photograph of Roosevelt delivering remarks to an estimated crowd of 40,000 to 50,000 people on the west steps of the Marion County, Indiana, courthouse. The <a href="Cirkut">Cirkut</a> camera that Bretzman used to capture the event produced a negative that measured 8 feet 7 inches long. On May 31, 1907, the "Indianapolis News" published a six-foot section of Bretzman's photograph spread across two inside pages (16 columns) of the newspaper. Reprints of Bretzman's Cirkut photograph appeared in magazines and other newspapers; the "Indianapolis News" sold smaller reproductions of the photograph to members of the public.

Bretzman thought that a photographic portrait must capture "the spirit of the subject" and have "a lifelike quality" that required the photographer to be "conversant with the effects of light and shadows." Examples of Bretzman's portraits of notable individuals include <a href="James%20Whitcomb%20Riley">James Whitcomb Riley</a>, <a href="Hoosier">Hoosier</a> poet; <a href="Carl%20G.%20Fisher">Carl G. Fisher</a>, a founder of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway; <a href="John%20L.%20Lewis">John L. Lewis</a>, who became president of the <a href="United%20Mine%20Workers">United Mine Workers</a> union; <a href="Captain">Captain</a> <a href="Paul%20V.%20McNutt">Paul V. McNutt</a>, who became the <a href="governor%20of%20Indiana">governor of Indiana</a>; and <a href="The%20Reverend">Reverend</a> and Mrs. <a href="Garfield%20Thomas%20Haywood">Garfield Thomas Haywood</a>, among others.

Bretzman also made photographs of significant buildings around the state, including early photographs of the <a href="Indiana%20School%20for%20the%20Deaf">Indiana School for the Deaf</a> at Indianapolis, the <a href="Indiana%20University%20Bloomington">Indiana University</a> campus at <a href="Bloomington%2C%20Indiana">Bloomington, Indiana</a>, and the <a href="French%20Lick%20Springs%20Hotel">French Lick Springs Hotel</a> in <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20Indiana">Orange County, Indiana</a>.
Bretzman's photographs of notable events include Theodore Roosevelt's visit to Indianapolis on May 30, 1907, early Indianapolis 500-mile race photographs, and an exhibition baseball game between the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> and the <a href="Indianapolis%20Indians">Indianapolis Indians</a> in 1920, among others.

Death and legacy.
Bretzman died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> on January 19, 1934, at his Sutherland Avenue home in Indianapolis at the age of sixty-seven. His burial took place <a href="Crown%20Hill%20Cemetery">Crown Hill Cemetery</a> in Indianapolis on January 22, 1934.

Bretzman's studio continued to thrive in Indianapolis after his death, when his son, Noble, took over the operation of the family's photography business. When Noble retired from full-time photography in 1976, the Bretzman photography studio closed after nearly eighty years of operation in Indianapolis, leaving behind "a captivating pictorial essay on people and event in Indiana history." The Bretzman Photo Company, which Charles founded in Indianapolis, includes numerous portraits that Charles made of individuals, as well as photographs of the first Indianapolis 500 race and major civic events in the city. His photographs also document the appearance of notable Indiana structures in the early twentieth century. Charles's son, Noble, who continued the family's photographic legacy is best known for his portraits, which include photographs of Indiana governors Paul V. McNutt and <a href="Roger%20D.%20Branigin">Roger D. Branigin</a>, and fashion photography, primarily through the work he did for the <a href="L.%20S.%20Ayres">L. S. Ayres</a> and Company. One of Noble's fashion photographs inspired the L S. Ayres and Company's slogan, "The Ayres Look." Noble's photography appeared in numerous advertisements for department stores in Indianapolis and other commercial clients; he also illustrated books for the <a href="Bobbs-Merrill%20Company">Bobbs-Merrill Company</a>.

After a fire destroyed the Bretzman family's studio in early July 1980, Noble donated the salvageable material to the Indiana Historical Society. Later that year, at its former headquarters at 315 West Ohio Street in Indianapolis, the Society mounted an exhibition of more than 100 of the Bretzman studio's photographs from its collections.

Vespro della Beata Vergine discography

This is a discography of the recordings of "<a href="Vespro%20della%20Beata%20Vergine">Vespro della Beata Vergine</a>" by <a href="Claudio%20Monteverdi">Claudio Monteverdi</a> – otherwise known as Monteverdi's "Vespers of 1610". The list may not be complete, particularly in respect of the most recent issues. Since the first vinyl recordings of the work in 1953, the "Vespers" have been recorded in numerous versions, involving both modern and period instruments. Some versions are choral-based, others use "one voice per part". In a few cases, for example the Stevens recording, the "sacred concertos" that divide the psalms are replaced by <a href="antiphon">antiphonal chants</a>.

In the list, the "Year" column indicates year of initial issue of each recording. For pre-1982 recordings, details of the first compact disc issue are included; thereafter, all issues refer to CDs. Where the date of recording is significantly earlier than the issue date, a note has been added. Many of the recordings have been reissued, sometimes multiple times, often under different labels – reissue details are not included.

Now's the Time (composition)

"Now's the Time" is a composition by <a href="Charlie%20Parker">Charlie Parker</a>. He led the first recording of it, on November 26, 1945.

Background and composition.
"Although Parker was capable of writing intricate <a href="bebop">bebop</a> melody lines, he sometimes stepped back from his more progressive leanings and drew on his Kansas City jazz roots in crafting simpler, bluesier compositions – of which 'Now's the Time' is a case in point." It is a riff-based blues, with typical bebop phrase endings at the end of bars 5 and 6.

Original recording.
"Now's the Time" was first recorded on November 26, 1945, by Charlie Parker's Reboppers: Parker (alto sax), <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a> (trumpet), <a href="Dizzy%20Gillespie">Dizzy Gillespie</a> or <a href="Sadik%20Hakim">Sadik Hakim</a> (piano), <a href="Curley%20Russell">Curley Russell</a> (bass), and <a href="Max%20Roach">Max Roach</a> (drums). Multiple takes were made; "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" suggests that "Parker's solo on the third take is superior in its slashing self-confidence to that on the fourth, which is slightly duller; Miles Davis plays without conviction on both." The fourth take was the original official release.

Influence.
The melody of "Now's the Time" was used for "<a href="The%20%20Hucklebuck">The Hucklebuck</a>", a hit for saxophonist <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28saxophonist%29">Paul Williams</a> four years after Parker's original recording. Despite being released by the same record label with the same producer, Parker was not credited; instead, the composition was attributed to <a href="Andy%20Gibson">Andy Gibson</a>, who had been a songwriter for <a href="Lucky%20Millinder">Lucky Millinder</a>, who recorded it as "D-Natural Blues".

John Cole (pirate)

John Cole (died 1718) was a pirate active off the American eastern seaboard. His brief career is associated with <a href="Richard%20Worley">Richard Worley</a> and <a href="William%20Moody%20%28pirate%29">William Moody</a>. He is known more for the unusual cargo of his pirate ship than for his piracy.

History.
Governor <a href="Robert%20Johnson%20%28governor%29">Robert Johnson</a> of the <a href="Province%20of%20South%20Carolina">Province of South Carolina</a> was worried about retaliatory attacks from pirates after the capture of <a href="Blackbeard">Blackbeard</a>’s associate <a href="Stede%20Bonnet">Stede Bonnet</a>. In October 1718 Johnson heard rumors that pirate William Moody was heading to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charles Town</a> and commissioned four vessels to oppose him, including Stede Bonnet’s former ship "Revenge". Scouts reported two ships anchored nearby and Johnson’s fleet sailed to meet them. The smaller sloop was not Moody; it had been the "New York’s Revenge" captained by Richard Worley, another pirate well-known in the Carolinas.

"Eagle", the larger ship under John Cole, fled the battle with two of Johnson’s ships in pursuit. Cole had been given the "Eagle" after its capture in September, renaming it "New York Revenge’s Revenge". It had been used as a <a href="ship%E2%80%99s%20tender">ship’s tender</a> to Worley’s vessel. Johnson’s fleet caught the "Eagle" a few hours later. Cole and Worley may have been sailing with Moody; later depositions from a sailor captured by Moody indicated that he’d heard of Johnson’s preparations and took a captured ship far offshore to plunder it before fleeing the area. Cole and Worley were tried, convicted, and hung off Charles Town in November 1718. Johnson shared out the reward for capturing Cole and Worley among the four vessels’ crews.

The cargo of Cole’s "New York Revenge’s Revenge" turned out not to be treasure or trade goods: its hold was full of prisoners, including 36 women shipped from London and bound for Virginia to be sold as <a href="indentured%20servant">indentured servants</a>. Many of the prisoners and crew had joined Cole’s pirates. At least one source reported that the women were to have been shipped to an island in the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, to start a new colony after being married off to English men, though the women perished aboard ship for lack of water and food.

ATYR 1923 was developed for the potential treatment of severe pulmonary diseases with an immune and fibrotic component, including interstitial lung disease.

Throughout 2016 and into the first half of 2017 aTyr released data on three Phase 1b/2 trials for Resolaris in adults with FSHD or LGMD2B, and early onset FSHD patients (ages 16–20). Data from these trials showed encouraging results for safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic profile, and signals of clinical activity in regards to muscle strength (Manual Muscle Testing) and disease burden (Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life score – INQoL).

Therapeutic concept.
<a href="Homeostasis">Homeostasis</a>, or the coordinated regulation of tissues within the body, is fundamental to the maintenance of the overall health of an organism. Lack of homeostasis can lead to disease and death. The process of homeostasis was first described in 1865 by the French physiologist <a href="Claude%20Bernard">Claude Bernard</a> and <a href="Walter%20Cannon">Walter Cannon</a> later coined the term. In the 150 years since this discovery, many proteins associated with homeostatic pathways have been discovered, ranging from insulin to erythropoietin.

aTyr was founded after Dr. Schimmel discovered several nontranslational functions of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, which are primarily responsible for the production of a vital component of protein synthesis, aminoacyl-tRNAs. [23] These nontranslational functions have since been shown to play an important role in maintaining homeostasis. [23] One of these nontranslational functions is modulation and regulation of the immune response. [23] This modulatory activity is a result of <a href="Physiocrine">Physiocrine</a>s, a novel class of proteins that are present as biologically active signaling regions of the tRNA synthetases. aTyr’s research is based on the premise that <a href="Physiocrine">Physiocrine</a>s are involved in orchestrating homeostatic activities to help the body restore diseased or damaged tissue to a healthier state.

By researching and understanding the role of <a href="Physiocrine">Physiocrine</a>s in immune modulation, aTyr has developed two IND candidates.

The story will include many DC characters but has particular focus on <a href="Superman">Superman</a> and <a href="Doctor%20Manhattan">Doctor Manhattan</a>. Johns felt like there was interesting story to be told in Rebirth with Doctor Manhattan. He thought there was an interesting dichotomy between Superman—a character who embodies and is compassionate for humanity—and Doctor Manhattan—a character who has detached himself from humanity. This led to over six months of debates amongst the creative team about whether to intersect the "Watchmen" universe with the DC Universe. He explained that "Doomsday Clock" was the "most personal and most epic, utterly mind-bending project" that he had worked on in his career.

Kheda Satyagraha of 1918

It was the second Satyagraha movement after <a href="Champaran%20Satyagraha">Champaran Satyagraha</a>.
Leaders.
In Gujarat, Gandhi was chiefly the spiritual head of the struggle. His chief lieutenant, <a href="Sardar%20Vallabhbhai%20Patel">Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</a> and a close coterie of devoted Gandhians, namely <a href="Indulal%20Yagnik">Indulal Yagnik</a>, <a href="Shankarlal%20Banker">Shankarlal Banker</a>, <a href="Mahadev%20Desai">Mahadev Desai</a>, <a href="Narhari%20Parikh">Narhari Parikh</a>, <a href="Mohanlal%20Pandya">Mohanlal Pandya</a> and <a href="Ravi%20Shankar%20Vyas">Ravi Shankar Vyas</a> toured the countryside, organised the villagers and gave them political leadership and direction. Many aroused Gujaratis from the cities of <a href="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a> and <a href="Vadodara">Vadodara</a> joined the organizers of the revolt, but Gandhi and Patel resisted the involvement of Indians from other provinces, seeking to keep it a purely Gujarati struggle. 

The struggle.
Patel and his colleagues organised a major tax revolt, and all the different ethnic and caste communities of <a href="Kheda">Kheda</a> rallied around it. The peasants of Kheda signed a petition calling for the tax for this year to be scrapped in wake of the famine. The government in Bombay rejected the charter. They warned that if the peasants did not pay, the lands and property would be confiscated and many arrested. And once confiscated, they would not be returned even if most complied. None of the villages flinched. 

The tax withheld, the government's collectors and inspectors sent in thugs to seize property and cattle, while the police forfeited the lands and all agrarian property. The farmers did not resist arrest, nor retaliate to the force employed with violence. Instead, they used their cash and valuables to donate to the "Gujarat Sabha" which was officially organising the protest.

The revolt was astounding in terms of discipline and unity. Even when all their personal property, land and livelihood were seized, a vast majority of Kheda's farmers remained firmly united in the support of Patel. Gujaratis sympathetic to the revolt in other parts resisted the government machinery, and helped to shelter the relatives and property of the protesting peasants. Those Indians who sought to buy the confiscated lands were ostracised from society. Although nationalists like <a href="Sardul%20Singh%20Caveeshar">Sardul Singh Caveeshar</a> called for sympathetic revolts in other parts, Gandhi and Patel firmly rejected the idea.

Result.
The Government finally sought to foster an honourable agreement for both parties. The tax for the year in question, and the next would be suspended, and the increase in rate reduced, while all confiscated property would be returned.

People also worked in cohesion to return the confiscated lands to their rightful owners. The ones who had bought the lands seized were influenced to return them, even though the British had officially said it would stand by the buyers.

Dr. Gidwani was born at <a href="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a> (Sind) on the 25th December 1889 and received his entire education there. After passing the matriculation examination his spirit of service impelled him to accept a teacher's job at Bubak in <a href="Dadu%20District">Dadu District</a>, but finding little scope for his activities there he chucked it up returning to Hyderabad, he joined the Medical School there, and after completing the course he entered Government service as a Medical Officer.

He successfully organised 'hartal' at Hyderabad in March 1919 in protest against the <a href="Rowlatt%20Act">Rowlatt Act</a>.
Dr. Choithram was sent to jail several times, first in 1922 when as editor of the "Hindu" his writings were regarded as seditious; then in 1930 when he broke the Salt Law at Karachi; again during the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1932 and also in 1933 for defying the Govt. orders not to leave Hyderabad; in 1940 for making a fiery speech at Lahore; and finally in 1942 for joining the Quit India Movement launched by Gandhiji.
Whenever outside jail, besides attending to his political activities he did valuable humanitarian work such as running a charitable dispensary, supplying medicines to the poor and the needy free of charge, collecting donations for Pathshalas and Narishalas, organising relief work during floods and earthquakes as also during communal riots, and taking measures to prevent persecution of one community at the hands of the other.
He died in the Northcote Nursing Home at Bombay on the night of the 13th September 1957.
Dr. Choithram was an embodiment of service and self-sacrifice. Way back in 1924 Gandhiji wrote about him in the Young India - "He has sacrificed everything and turned into a 'Faqir' all for the cause of his country."

Potomac District (VHSL)

The Potomac District is a high school conference in the <a href="Virginia%20High%20School%20League">VHSL</a> that is made up of mostly schools from <a href="Loudoun%20County%2C%20Virginia">Loudoun County</a> that have a high enrollment capacity.

History of the District.
Original District.
The original Potomac District was founded in 1965 when the Northern Region expanded from two to three districts along with the Alexandria District and the Northern District. The original charter members of the district were Langley, Marshall, McLean, J.E.B. Stuart, Wakefield, Washington-Lee and Yorktown. The district lasted until 1972 due to low membership but was revived in 1975 and then disbanded again in 1994 when the Northern Region realigned the districts.

Current District.
In 2015, the current Potomac District was revived to alleviate crowding within the <a href="Dulles%20District">Dulles District</a> and for schools in <a href="Loudoun%20County%2C%20Virginia">Loudoun County</a> with a higher enrollment. With the opening of <a href="Tuscarora%20High%20School%20%28Virginia%29">Tuscarora</a> in 2010 and the increasing enrollment by Briar Woods, Broad Run, Stone Bridge and Potomac Falls, led to the district's creation. The result made the Dulles District only have schools in Class 4A or below.

Margaret (album)

Margaret is a collaborative music and multi-media project by <a href="Jason%20Webley">Jason Webley</a> and Friends. It was released on December 12, 2014 on 11 Records. It is presented in the format of a book with a compact disc. It is a concept album about Margaret Rucker, an <a href="Americans">American</a> poet.

Contributing musical artists on the album include <a href="Jason%20Webley">Jason Webley</a>, <a href="Eliza%20Rickman">Eliza Rickman</a>, Shenandoah Davis, Led To Sea, Mts. & Tunnels, <a href="Jherek%20Bischoff">Jherek Bischoff</a>, Lonesome Leash, and <a href="Parenthetical%20Girls">Zac Pennington</a>. Scrapbook material of Margaret was presented by <a href="Chicken%20John">Chicken John</a> Rinaldi.

The Life of Margaret Rucker Armstrong.
Margaret Rucker was an American poet born in <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett, Washington</a> on December 12, 1907, Margaret Rucker was one of two children of <a href="Rucker%20Brothers">Bethel Rucker</a>, who was a local businessman and one of the primary founders of the town. The same month she was born her father and uncle began work on building the Rucker Mausoleum, a very large step pyramid in Evergreen Cemetery. She graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> in <a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>. While in college she published three poems in ‘’University of Washington Poems, Third Series’’. After college she married Justus Rodgers Armstrong on July 18th, 1931, and moved with him to <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco, California</a>. She had two sons, John and George Rucker, the latter of whom she was pregnant with when she and her husband were in a car crash that left Margaret in critical condition.

Margaret’s life turned tragic one evening in her <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a> home. After dinner while having an after dinner coffee her husband got a pistol and committed suicide. It appears her poem “Two-Deaths” is about the loss of her husband. Margaret committed suicide herself on June 18, 1959 at the age of 51 by overdosing on sleeping pills. She was interned in the family pyramid in Everett.

Creation.
Margaret’s story is largely preserved owing to a series of coincidences. <a href="Chicken%20John">Chicken John</a> Rinaldi was removing furniture from a dumpster in San Francisco when he found a scrapbook on Margaret in the dumpster. He kept the scrapbook for many years, but owing to a persistent illness from <a href="copper%28II%29%20sulfate%23Toxicological%20effects">copper sulfate poisoning</a> he decided the best way to preserve Margaret’s memory was to hold a show about her and the audience take pieces of the scrapbook with them, since he did not want the scrapbook to end up in another dumpster. Years later <a href="Amanda%20Palmer">Amanda Palmer</a> was visiting <a href="Jason%20Webley">Jason Webley</a> in Everett, and asked about the Ruckers, since so many things in the town are named after them. Webley then took Palmer to the Rucker Pyramid. The next day Palmer and Webley went in San Francisco, and Webley met with Chicken John, and mentioned to him his life in Everett. Chicken John showed Webley the few scanned images from the scrapbook he had, which prompted Webley to seek to know more about Margaret. On April 11, 2014 Jason Webley organized a show at the Historic Everett Theater, featuring musical performances by a number of other artists, along with Chicken John telling his story and showing images from the scrapbook. Later that year they produced a book called "Margaret", which includes images from the scrapbook, narratives by Chicken John and Jason Webley, and a disc of the musical performances.

Live Performances.
Beyond the live performance at the Historical Everett Theater on April 11, 2014, there were only a few other live performances of the concept album and presentation of images from the scrapbook. These additional performances constitute the album’s release tour, and they began on December 12, Margaret Rucker’s birthday. The performances are as follows:

NEWPALMYRA

In 2012, Khartabil was arrested, and the original project and open source files were lost. Barry Threw took over as director of the project, renamed #NEWPALMYRA, and a community of developers, modelers, and archaeologists began collaborating to model, restore, and later recreate from scratch those historical structures captured on film and camera. 

In 2015, ISIL captured Palmyra and began destroying some of its famous historical sites. In late 2015, the <a href="Institute%20for%20Digital%20Archaeology">Institute for Digital Archaeology</a> began contributing to the New Palmyra Project, sending archaeologists with cheap 3D cameras to capture any further structures that ISIL might decide to destroy. 

One of the best known structures in Palmyra was the monumental Arch of Triumph (قوس النصر). Constructed during the reign of Emperor <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a> (193 to 211), it was sometimes mistakenly referred to as <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>’s arch. It was restored in the 1930s, and then destroyed completely during the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian Civil War</a> in 2015.

3D models.
Palmyra's main streets were not at right angles, and this arch was famously built at a 30-degree turn in the colonnade between the tetrapylon (التترابيل) and the Temple of Bel (معبد بل‎), with two richly carved façades angled away from one another. 

A square platform, each corner containing a group of four columns. This was erected during the renovations of Diocletian at the end of the 3rd century. Each column had a pedestal in its center that originally supported a statue. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite. Only one was undamaged in 1963 when the whole was restored with concrete. Destroyed again by <a href="ISIL">ISIL</a> on January 20, 2017.

This ancient temple was dedicated to the Mesopotamian god Bel in 32 AD. Bel was worshipped at Palmyra along with the moon god Aglibol and the sun god Yarhibol. The ruins of the temple were among the best preserved at Palmyra. they were destroyed by ISIL in August, 2015.

The Roman Theatre at Palmyra (المسرح الروماني بتدمر‎) dates to the time of Severus. Its remains were restored in the 20th century, and it served for a time as a venue for the annual Palmyra festival. It was destroyed by ISIL in May 2015. 

The Temple of Baal Shamin dates to the 2nd century BC, and dedicated to the Canaanite sky deity. Its altar was built in 115 AD, and the temple was rebuilt in 131 AD. In the 5th century AD, it was converted to a church. In 2015 it was destroyed by ISIL.

This was the first statue modeled by #rsssd (Re-Sculpting Syrian Statues Digitally). In 2015 it was destroyed by ISIL.

Reconstructions and exhibits.
A 12-ton lifesize replica of part of the Arch of Triumph was carved into stone, from these models, and installed in London's Trafalgar Square in 2016.

A number of small artefacts were reconstructed and displayed at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale. 

A 10-foot model of part of the Tetrapylon, printed in a single piece, was unveiled at the April 2017 Creative Commons Summit.

Popular discussion.
The project began to hold public events, partner with design groups and 3D printing shops, and receive press coverage starting in 2015.

"Reviving Palmyra", a book on the history, destruction, and reconstruction of Palmyra, was published in 2017.

Noli me tangere (Correggio)

Noli me tangere is a 1523-1524 painting by <a href="Correggio">Correggio</a> of the subject <a href="noli%20me%20tangere">noli me tangere</a>.

History.
The first mention of the painting is in the manuscript of <a href="Pietro%20Lamo">Pietro Lamo</a>'s "Graticola di Bologna", dating to around 1560 and stating it was in the house of the Ercolani counts. It is also praised by <a href="Vasari">Vasari</a> in two passages in his "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Artists">Lives of the Artists</a>" of 1568, once in Correggio's own biography and once in that of <a href="Girolamo%20da%20Carpi">Girolamo da Carpi</a>. It was seen in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> at the end of the 16th century by cardinal <a href="Pietro%20Aldobrandini">Pietro Aldobrandini</a>, who paid a very high price to buy it.

It later passed from the Alobrandini collection to that of <a href="Ludovico%20Ludovisi">Ludovico Ludovisi</a>, as shown by (for example) a postscript to Vasari's "Lives" by Lelio Guidiccioni: "at present the Most Illustrious Lodovisio has four other marvellous works in one room, seen by me on 7 March 1621". Little more than ten years later Prince Niccolò Ludovisi - "in the necessity of anguish" - decided to curry favour with <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Spain">Philip IV of Spain</a> by giving him the best works from his collection. One of these was the "Noli me tangere", which left Rome in the late 1630s or early 1640s, once a copy had been made of it. It arrived in Madrid by the end of 1643, after a brief stop in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">Kingdom of Naples</a>. It is now in the <a href="Prado%20Museum">Prado Museum</a>.

Background.
In researching journalists, <a href="David%20Auburn">David Auburn</a> became interested in frequent references to Joseph Alsop. "I I realized here was this person who was so well known, so influential — almost a household name in his day — and now he's completely obscure," explained Auburn. "And, the play kind of came out of wondering, 'How does that happen? How do you go from being that central figure to being, at first, a kind of joke and then almost forgotten?' It was in digging into that that I found the story."

Synopsis.
Set between 1954 and 1968, American journalist <a href="Joseph%20Alsop">Joseph Alsop</a> finds his relevance fading as attention shifts from the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

John Swann (active 1698-99, first name also Jon, possibly also referred to as "Paul Swan") was a minor pirate in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, known almost entirely for speculation about his relationship with <a href="Robert%20Culliford">Robert Culliford</a>.

History.
Swann had been captured with Culliford near <a href="Mangalore">Mangalore</a>, spending four years imprisoned with him until their 1696 escape. In late 1698 Swann was living on <a href="Ile%20Ste.%20Marie">Ile Ste. Marie</a> ("St. Mary's Island") near <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> with fellow Captain Robert Culliford, who is occasionally cited as a <a href="bisexual">bisexual</a> or <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a> pirate. While there, Swann was referred to as “a great consort of Culliford’s, who lives with him.”

<a href="Consort%20%28nautical%29">Consort</a> was the naval term for a sister ship or for two allied vessels sailing the same course; there was also a custom among pirates and sailors in general called ""matelotage"" (from the French for "seamanship”), which was sometimes referred to as “consortship." A few writers argue that "matelotage" was effectively <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a>, while most maintain it was primarily non-sexual and was more akin to a civil partnership: an agreement to share goods and wealth, survivor's benefits if one partner died, and so forth. Written "matelotage" agreements were rare, and there is no detailed information on Swann’s actual relationship with Culliford beyond that of sailing in consort and living together, and so the issue remains open.

In 1699 a number of Culliford's crew left his ship "Resolution" (actually <a href="Ralph%20Stout">Ralph Stout</a>'s "Mocha", renamed) and stayed at Madagascar, paying merchant ships to return them to America. Among them were <a href="Otto%20Van%20Tuyl">Otto Van Tuyl</a> and a "Paul Swan". This was likely not John Swann, who is recorded in depositions as still on the island. Culliford had left St. Mary's to cruise in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean again; he invited Swann to join him on returning to piracy at sea, but Swann declined. Later when Culliford accepted a pardon offered to the Madagascar pirates, Swann accepted as well. Swann made his way back to <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> but decided not to follow Culliford any further; Culliford was eventually arrested and sent to London for trial, where his testimony against <a href="Samuel%20Burgess">Samuel Burgess</a> helped him gain his freedom.

Caroline Risque

Caroline Everett Risque (August 20, 1883 - April 9, 1952) was an American painter and sculptor, a member of the early 20th century artistic group "<a href="The%20Potters%20%28group%29">The Potter's Wheel</a>".

Early life.
Caroline Risque was the daughter of Ferdinand W. Risque, born in Georgetown, D.C., and Aline Brooks, of Mobile, Alabama. She had two sisters, who married L. T. Chalker, of New York, and John Blizard, of Ottawa.

Risque went first to Miss Lockwood's kindergarten, for two years, and then she studied with a private tutor, Jennie Harris, until she was ten years old. Her secondary studies were at the Marquette High School, followed by several years at Hosmer Hall, preparatory school in St. Louis, under Louise McNair. It was at Hosmer Hall that she met <a href="Sara%20Teasdale">Sara Teasdale</a> and in 1903 introduced her to <a href="Parrish%20Sisters">Williamina Parrish</a>; these early meetings led to the founding of The Potter's Wheel.

Risque attended <a href="Arts%20and%20Sciences%20at%20Washington%20University%20in%20St.%20Louis">Arts and Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis</a>, under <a href="George%20Julian%20Zolnay">George Julian Zolnay</a>, and followed him at the <a href="University%20City%2C%20Missouri">University City, Missouri</a> in 1909, when Zolnay became director of the Art Academy.

One of Risque's most ambitious pieces of work, modeled in her own Paris studio, was a fountain which was exhibited at the 1913 Paris Salon. which was favorably received by the French press. Her ambition was to create decorative works: fountains, gates, portals and mantels; objects and subjects in which she could be entirely original.

Risque sold many pieces while abroad, one of them going to the home of an ambassador, and another to the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Museum%20of%20Art">New Orleans Museum of Art</a>. 

In 1915 Risque exhibited five pieces at the <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20International%20Exposition">Panama–Pacific International Exposition</a>, a world fair held in San Francisco between February 20 and December 4 in 1915. Her pieces were: the paintings Mere Colaer, In the Morning, Josef, The Old One, and Bird Fountain, a sculpture. In 1916 Risque exhibited at the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Academy%20of%20the%20Fine%20Arts">Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts</a>.

Risque was a teacher at <a href="John%20Burroughs%20School">John Burroughs School</a> where she founded the art department and became chair. In 1929 Risque helped Marion Rombauer Becker, daughter of <a href="Irma%20S.%20Rombauer">Irma S. Rombauer</a>, obtain a position in the Art Department.

She said when it came to her work, she wished no leniency was shown because it was created by a woman. She wanted to stand or fall as an artist, and not as a "woman artist".

In 1984 the bronze busts of the four founders of <a href="Stix%20Baer%20%26amp%3B%20Fuller">Stix Baer & Fuller</a>, a department store chain in St. Louis, were donated to the <a href="Missouri%20Historical%20Society">Missouri Historical Society</a> by the Stix, Baer and Fuller families. The busts, made by Risque, had been in the Stix Baer & Fuller's downtown store, and were removed when the store was acquired by <a href="Dillard%27s">Dillard's</a>.

Personal life.
Caroline Risque lived in St. Louis and New Orleans. She was small in stature, had black hair and beautiful gray eyes, unusual in their size and particularly their expression.

Back in the United States from Paris, Risque married Julien Janis (1883-1951), president of the Missouri Safe Deposit Association, and they had one daughter, Aline Janis Herrera (1920-2013). Later Risque's daughter said her mother's commitment to art suffered from her marriage and from having a child.

Risque is buried at <a href="Bellefontaine%20Cemetery">Bellefontaine Cemetery</a>, St. Louis, together with her family members. Her husband Julien Janis is buried in nearby <a href="Calvary%20Cemetery%20%28St.%20Louis%29">Calvary Cemetery (St. Louis)</a>.

<doc id="54747507" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54747507" title="Philco computers">
Philco computers

<a href="Philco">Philco</a> was one of the pioneers of transistorized computers. After the company developed a surface barrier <a href="transistor">transistor</a>, much faster than previous point-contact types, it was awarded contracts for military and government computers. Commercialized derivatives of some of these designs became successful business and scientific computers. The TRANSAC (Transistor Automatic Computer) Model S-1000 was released as a scientific computer. The TRANSAC S-2000 mainframe computer system was first produced in 1958, and a family of compatible machines, with increasing performance, was released over the next several years. 

However, the mainframe computer market was dominated by <a href="IBM">IBM</a>. Other companies could not deploy resources for development, customer support and marketing on the scale that IBM could afford, making competition in this segment difficult after the introduction of the IBM 360 family. Philco went bankrupt and was purchased in 1961 by <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a>, but the computer division carried on until the Philco division of Ford exited the computer business in 1963. The Ford company maintained one Philco mainframe in use until 1981. 

The <a href="surface-barrier%20transistor">surface-barrier transistor</a> had a much higher frequency response than the original point-contact transistors. The transistor was made of a thin crystal of germanium, which was electrolytically etched with pits on either side forming a very thin base region, on the order of 5 micrometers. Phlco's process for etching was United States patent number 2,885,571. Philco surface-barrier transistors were used in <a href="TX-0">TX-0</a>, and in early models of what would become the DEC <a href="Programmed%20Data%20Processor">PDP</a> product line. Although relatively fast, the small size of the devices limited their power to circuits operating at a few tens of milliwatts. 

Military and government.
Between 1955 and 1957, Philco built transistor computers for use in aircraft, models C1000, C1100, and C1102, intended for airborne real-time applications. By 1957, the C1102 had been used by a civilian sector customer. 
The BASICPAC AN/TYK 6V, COMPAC AN/TYK 4V, and LOGIPAC systems were built for the US Army as transportable computer systems for use with their <a href="Fieldata">Fieldata</a> concept of integrated information management.

BASICPAC was a transistorized computer with up to 28,672 words of 38-bit core memory (including sign and parity), available in several configurations from a minimum system, to a truck-borne mobile version, to a fully expanded system. Basic clock periods was 1 microsecond, with 12 microsecond memory access and a fixed-point multiplication taking 242 microseconds. Input/output was by paper tape reader and punch, or through a teletypewriter. With additional hardware, magnetic tape storage was also available, with up to seven I/O devices. The instruction set had 31 basic operation codes and 9 opcodes for I/O 

CXPQ.
Philco was contracted by the US Navy to build the CXPQ computer. One model was completed and installed at the <a href="David%20Taylor%20Model%20Basin">David Taylor Model Basin</a>. This design was later adapted to become the commercial TRANSAC S-2000. Only one CXPQ was built. 

SOLO.
In 1955, the <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a> through the US Navy contracted with Philco to produce a computer suitable for use as a workstation, with an architecture based on the vacuum-tube computer system called Atlas II already in use at the NSA, and similar to the commercial <a href="UNIVAC%201103">UNIVAC 1103</a>. At the time, Philco was the largest producer of surface barrier transistors, which were the only type available at the time in the speed and quantities required for a computer. The SOLO prototype was delivered in 1958, but required extensive debugging at NSA and no further instances were ordered. Difficulties were encountered with core memory and power supplies. SOLO used <a href="paper%20tape">paper tape</a> and teleprinter machines for input and output. SOLO cost about $1 million US, and contained 8,000 transistors. While the system was extensively used for training, testing, research and development, no additional units were ordered. SOLO was removed from active service in 1963. The design of the SOLO became commercialized as Philco's TRANSAC Model S-1000.

Commercial.
S-1000.
The TRANSAC S-1000 was a scientific computer with a 36 bit word length and 4096 words of core memory. It was packaged in a container about the size of a large office desk, and used only 1.2 kilowatts, much less than vacuum-tube based computers of similar capacity. 
In a 1961 survey, about 15 S-1000 computer installations had been identified. 

S-2000.
The TRANSAC S-2000 was a large mainframe system intended for both business and scientific work. It had a 48 bit word length and supported calculations in fixed point, floating point and binary-coded decimal formats. The original S 2000 "TRANSAC" (Transistor Automatic Computer) released in 1958 was later designated Model 210; it was used internally at Philco. Similar to the <a href="Control%20Data%20Corporation">Control Data Corporation</a> Model <a href="CDC%201604">1604</a>, it was a 48-bit fully transistorized computer. Three succeeding models were released in the series, all compatible with the software of the original model. The Model 211 was introduced in 1960, usng micro-alloy diffused <a href="field-effect%20transistor">field-effect transistor</a>s, requiring significant redesign of circuits compared to the original. By 1961, 18 Model 210, 18 Model 211 and 7 Model 212 systems had been sold. 

After Philco was purchased by <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a>, the Model 212 was released in 1963. It had 65,535 words of 48 bit memory; initially made with 6 microsecond core memory, it had better performance than the <a href="IBM%207094">IBM 7094</a> transistor computer. It was later upgraded in 1964 to 2 microsecond core, which gave the machine floating-point performance greater than the IBM <a href="STRETCH">STRETCH</a> computer. A Model 213 was announced in 1964 but never built. By that time competition from IBM had made the Philco computer operations no longer profitable for Ford, and the division was closed down. 

The Model 212 could carry out a floating-point multiplication in 22 microseconds. Each word contained two 24-bit instructions with 16 bits of address information and 8 bits for the <a href="opcode">opcode</a>. There were 225 different valid opccdes in the Model 212; invalid opcodes were detected and halted the machine. The CPU had an accumulator register of 48 bits, three general purpose registers of 24 bits, and 32 index registers of 15 bits. Main memory size ranged from 4K words to 64K words; initially the system was delivered with core memory that had a 10-microsecond access time, but later units were shipped with 2-microsecond core, significantly improving performance. Only the first model had a magnetic drum memory; later editions used tape drives. 

Software for the S-2000 initially consisted of TAC (Translator-Assember-Compiler), and ALTAC, a FORTRAN II -like language with some differences from the IBM 704 FORTRAN implementation. A <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a> compiler was also available, targeted at business applications. 

The Philco 2400 was the input/output system for the S-2000. Operations such as reading cards or printing were carried out through magnetic tapes, thereby offloading the S-2000 from relatively slow input/output processing. The 2400 had a 24-bit word length and could be supplied with 4K to 32K characters (1K to 8 K words) of core memory, rated at 3 microsecond cycle time. The instruction set was aimed at character I/O use. 

The last Philco TRANSAC S-2000 Model 212 was taken out of service in December 1981, after 19 years service at Ford.

A store is open and functions as a neighborhood market at this location, under a different name and ownership - nothing left of the original store. 
History.
When <a href="John%20Howell%20Sears">John Howell Sears</a> had to leave <a href="Searsville%2C%20California">Searsville</a> because of the decline of the lumber industry in that area, he settled in the La Honda area in 1862, bought 400 acres of land and he built this store. The exact date of the building of the store is unknown but estimated between the 1860s to 1870s.

The store was nicknamed the "Bandit-Built Store" because it's rumored that Jim, Cole and Bob Younger (of the bank robbing <a href="James%E2%80%93Younger%20Gang">James–Younger Gang</a>) helped build the store and worked there too, while hiding out in La Honda and pretending to be lumberjacks. However in Bob Dougherty's 2007 book named "La Honda," "...the story of the 'bandit built' Sears store is improbable because the Younger brothers were already in prison in the summer of 1876 for the Northfield Bank robbery before the store was built the following year."

Investigations into the prevalence of these practices have been conducted by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>. Their studies demonstrate that this is a global problem. Women experience 
disrespectful, abusive or neglectful treatment during their childbirth when the birth occurs in medical and health facilities. The abusive relationship and trust between women and health providers can create a great reluctance to obtain medical assistance during birth. Disrespectful and abusive treatment can be experienced during pregnancy. During childbirth, a woman is very vulnerable and cannot protect herself. The results of this abuse can have very negative consequences for the infant and the mother.

WHO has found situations and circumstances where health facilities have participated in physical abuse, the withholding of pain medication, disrespect, humiliation, lack of confidentiality, lack of privacy, lack of informed consent, forced sterilization, refusing to be admitted to the facility, neglect during the birth, involuntary medical procedures, lack of confidentiality, withholding medical information and detention of the women at the facility because she is unable to pay the facility. In addition, the neglect during childbirth has resulted in life-threatening complications that could have responded to appropriate medical intervention.

Hiking trails by Nordegg, Alberta

Nordegg, Alberta has many different hiking options in the area.
Coliseum Mountain.
Access and Directions.
The trailhead is 3.8 km from the intersection of Highway 11 and Nordegg. Turn west on Highway 11 and make a quick right onto the Shunda Creek Road. Follow the signs for the Coliseum trailhead. At the fork, turn right onto Baldy Mountain Road. Then turn right onto Eagle Drive and drive until you reach the trailhead on the left side of the road.

From the trailhead, go east and cross the creek bed before turning left up the switchbacks. The path curves left at the top and heads directly to the unique, craggy summit along the ridge. The top of Coliseum used to house one of the first fire lookouts in Alberta.
Mount Baldy (Shunda Mountain).
Access and Directions.
The trailhead is 7.8 km from the intersection of Highway 11 and Nordegg. From the intersection, go west and quickly turn right onto the Shunda Creek Road. Turn right onto Baldy Mountain Road and drive all the way up to a red gate that marks the beginning of the trailhead. The hike follows the quad trail 2.8 km up the back of the mountain to the fire lookout at the top. Do not enter the lookout property, but take in the beautiful view of the North Saskatchewan River Valley at the top.
Crescent Falls.
Access and Directions.
From the intersection of Highway 11 and Nordegg, drive west on Highway 11 for approximately 18 km. Turn right just after the Bighorn Service gas station at the Crescent Falls sign. Follow the gravel road for 3.5 km and park on the left side of the road at a lookout that offers a view of the Bighorn River below.

Hike to the right and follow the ravine 2.3 km all the way to Crescent Falls, a gorgeous double-ledge waterfall.

Alternatively, drive up the road and past the lookout all the way to the parking lot (6 km from Highway 11), which is right beside Crescent Falls.
Allstones Lake.
Access and Directions.
From the intersection of Highway 11 and Nordegg, drive west on Highway 11 for approximately 31.1 km, then turn left just before reaching Allstones Creek. Park in the staging area parking lot. The trail begins on the north side of the highway, and it is about 4 km to the lake. Go up the first steep embankment, where there is an obvious signpost with "Allstones" carved into it. The trail is very obvious as it climbs up the mountain. It is a steep but rewarding hike that wends through beautiful forest before opening up to beautiful views of nearby mountains and Abraham Lake in the valley below. The last part of the hike brings you horizontally across the mountain on a very narrow path before coming to a fork. Both paths lead to the lake, but the main path goes to the left. It brings you quickly to Allstones Lake, a narrow mountain lake with sparkling green water, bordered by towering peaks to the west.
Allstones Ridge.
From Allstones Lake, head back to the trail fork. From there, a short distance to the east is a path that leads left and up the ridge. This is the easiest way up to the ridge; it is a gradual slope that quickly rises above the treeline and offers an unobstructed view of the North Saskatchewan River Valley, as well as the mountains to the north.
Hoodoo Creek.
Access and Directions.
Hoodoo Creek is 38.1 km west of the intersection of Highway 11 and Nordegg. After passing Windy Point westbound, park beside the third creek bed. Hoodoo Creek is notoriously hard to distinguish from other creeks on the highway, with few helpful landmarks. There is a tire in the ditch with a stick jutting out from it, and there is a guardrail on the south side of the highway where the creek flows underneath. Park in the ditch and hike up the right side of the creek. Eventually, it will be necessary to drop down into the creek bed before reaching the hoodoos. The creek and surrounding rock have an interesting appearance. There is a cave further up the creek, about 1.9 km from the trailhead. It can be accessed on the right side of the creek after scrambling up a steep embankment. Bring a flashlight to explore the cave.
Vision Quest.
Access and Directions.
From the intersection of Highway 11 and Nordegg, drive west for approximately 42.7 km. Turn right just past the "Waste Transfer Site" sign. Go up the gravel road and park beside the Cline Waste Transfer Site. There is no obvious trailhead sign. Walk to the right side of the transfer site and start hiking up the ridge. Vision Quest is a gruelling climb from start to finish. The first summit is approximately 3.2 km from the trailhead.
Siffleur Falls.
Access and Directions.
From the intersection of Highway 11 and Nordegg, drive west 62.7 km. Turn left into the Siffleur Falls Trail Staging Area parking lot. From the trailhead, walk southeast to the suspension bridge and cross over. Go along the boardwalk and cross the Siffleur River bridge. Turn right and follow the river upstream until you reach Siffleur Falls. The falls are approximately 3.2 km from the trailhead. 

Kinglet Lake.
Access and Directions.
From the intersection between Highway 11 and Nordegg, drive 65.5 km west of Nordegg. The trailhead is on the right side of the highway, just past the Siffleur Falls staging area. It is easy to miss, as it is a small pullout that connects to a quad trail. There is a small Kinglet Lake sign on a fence post, but it is difficult to see on the highway. Park in the ditch before beginning the hike. Follow the trail as it winds up the ridge for 2.1 km. Then, in a meadowy area, turn left onto the Kinglet Lake trail. It is very easy to miss; many accidentally go up the main trail to Tuff Puff. Look carefully on the left side of the trail for the word "King" and an arrow written with small rocks on the ground. This trail is approximately 2.9 km from the lake. Follow it down into a creek valley. After crossing the stream, go up the ridge to the Hoodoo. This is the steepest and most exposed part of the hike; it is nearly a scramble for quite a long way. After this section, follow the path up through the trees until you reach the beautiful emerald-green lake surrounded by stunning pink-red ridges.

Charles de Wendel

Charles de Wendel (13 December 1809 – 15 April 1870) was a French steel manufacturer in <a href="Lorraine">Lorraine</a> and a deputy in the French legislative assembly.

Origins.
The <a href="de%20Wendel%20family">de Wendel family</a> can be traced back to Jean Wendel of <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, who married Marie de Wanderve around 1600.
His descendants in the male line mostly pursued military careers.
Jean's descendent <a href="Jean-Martin%20Wendel">Jean-Martin Wendel</a> (1665–1737) purchased the factories of Le Comte in <a href="Hayange">Hayange</a>, Lorraine, in 1704.
This was the foundation of the family's industrial operations.
The purchase of the mastership of a forge carried with it a noble title, and Martin Wendel became Martin de Wendel, seigneur d'Hayange.
He was followed by eight generations of steelmakers.
The Wendels lost their forge and foundry at Hayange during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>.
The banker <a href="Florentin%20Seilli%C3%A8re">Florentin Seillière</a> (1744–1825) helped them buy it back in 1804, and in 1811 helped them buy the nearby Moyeuvre forge.

Early years.
Alexis Charles de Wendel was born on 13 December 1809 in <a href="Metz">Metz</a>, Moselle.
He was the second son of François de Wendel (1778–1825) and Françoise Joséphine de Fischer de Dicourt (1784–1872).
His father was deputy from 1815–16 and from 1818–25, and master of the Hayange foundry.
After his father died in 1825, his mother took over management of the family business.
Charles' older brother, Victor-François, was not interested in running the family business and moved from Hayange to estates on the <a href="Seille%20%28Moselle%29">Seille</a> river.
Charles was sixteen when his father died.
He entered the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a> in 1828, and after graduating went to England to study mining and metallurgy.
Charles returned to France in 1834.
On 29 May 1843 Charles de Wendel married Jeanne Marie de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut.

Industrialist.
Charles de Wendel had to share control of the enterprise with his mother and his brother-in-law, Baron Théodore de Gargan, which he resented, and blamed on the insistence of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Code">Napoleonic Code</a> on the equal rights of heirs.
In the 1830s the family matriarch, Madame Joséphine de Wendel, drew up contracts through which the children and grandchildren of François de Wendel would nominally receive a cash payment as their share of the inheritance, but the money would be invested in the business, paying a low rate of return.
Théodore de Gargan died in 1851 and Charles became the sole manager, but still shared ownership with his siblings and their children.
On 24 April 1857 Madame de Wendel, Charles de Wendel and Théodore de Gargan junior signed a deed that established the "commandite" of Le Fils de Francois de Wendel et Cie. 
Madame de Wendel put up almost all the capital of the partnership and took 80% of the profits, while Charles took 12% and Gargan took 8%.

Wendel and Gargan greatly expanded operations at Hayange and Moyeuvre in the 1840s and 1850s. 
Both plants were connected by rail to the company's coal mines and coke furnaces at <a href="Stiring-Wendel">Stiring-Wendel</a> and at <a href="Seraing">Seraing</a> in Belgium, alleviating a chronic shortage of coal and coke.
During the metallurgy slump of 1847–50 Charles de Wendel was assisted by the <a href="Bank%20of%20France">Bank of France</a>, which he fully repaid in 1851.
In the crisis year of 1848 Charles de Wendel and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Schneider">Eugène Schneider</a> saved the foundry at <a href="Fourchambault">Fourchambault</a> from bankruptcy by co-signing a huge bank loan.

In 1846 Charles de Wendel and the Parisian businessman Georges Hainguerlot bought the coal mining concession of <a href="Sch%C5%93neck">Schœneck</a>.
Surveys proved positive, and in 1851 Wendel, Hainguerlot, the engineer Kind and the surveyor d'Hausens formed a limited company to exploit the concession, authorized in 1853 as the Compagnie des houillères de Stiring (Stiring Coal Company).
The first two shafts were sunk using an innovative system designed by Kind, but ran into problems with water.
A third shaft, sunk with more conventional techniques, was started in 1854 and entered production in 1856.
Other shafts were sunk, and production grew steadily.

Charles de Wendel undertook construction of the very modern Stiring factory while negotiating the purchase of the Schœneck concession.
It was located within the concession area and mainly manufactured railway rails. A coal extraction shaft was sunk near the factory buildings, and during the <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">Second French Empire</a> the Compagnie de Stiring sold coal to the Wendel company at generally favorable prices.
In 1865 the Wendel metallurgical factories were taking of the output from the Compagnie de Stiring, paying below market prices.
The company records show that Charles de Wendel intervened in board meetings several times to reduce the price paid for coal by his factories.
For many years Charles de Wendel undertook costly but unsuccessful experiments on removing phosphorus from pig iron.
It was only in 1879, after his death, that the company obtained the rights to use the <a href="Thomas%20process">Thomas process</a>.

Charles de Wendel and Théodore de Gargan founded the city of <a href="Stiring-Wendel">Stiring-Wendel</a>.
The workers' town, dominated by the factories and their managers, was a model that was followed in France into the 1930s.
Charles de Wendel initiated a policy of recruiting from the children of his workers, with son following father.
In the 1850s he began a system by which promotions would be assured, based on seniority, which encouraged loyalty.
To ensure a supply of fuel Charles de Wendel purchased the <a href="Petite-Rosselle">Petite-Rosselle</a> coal mines,
He created a railway network to connect the factories to each other and to the lines of the <a href="Chemins%20de%20fer%20de%20l%27Est">Chemins de fer de l'Est</a>.
Charles de Wendel became an administrator of the Chemins de fer de l'Est.

Charles de Wendel supported the tariff reductions of the Anglo-French <a href="Cobden%E2%80%93Chevalier%20Treaty">Cobden–Chevalier Treaty</a> of 1860, saying his only regret was that his competitor, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Schneider">Eugène Schneider</a> (1805–75), had been consulted beforehand and he only afterwards.
What would become the <a href="Comit%C3%A9%20des%20forges">Comité des forges</a> was founded in 1864.
The Committee had the goals of managing relations between the industry and government, promoting exports and coordinating prices.
Eugène Schneider was the first President.
There were ten members, each representing a region, including Charles de Wendel of Hayange.
The Comité des forges was always handicapped by divisions between the members from the center, the north and the east of the country.
For example, Charles de Wendel resented the control of the committee exerted by Schneider of <a href="Le%20Creusot">Le Creusot</a> in <a href="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>.

Politician.
In 1848 Charles de Wendel was elected to the General Council of Moselle by acclamation.
he represented the canton of <a href="Thionville">Thionville</a>.
On 13 May 1849 he was elected Representative for Moselle in the legislative assembly, where he sat on the right.
He fully supported the policy of <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>, and approved Napoleon's coup d'etat.
He was elected deputy to the legislature as the government candidate for the second district of Moselle on 29 February 1852, and reelected on 22 June 1857 and 1 June 1863, each time with a huge majority.
He resigned from the legislative assembly in 1867 due to health problems.
He left office on 19 February 1867 and was replaced by <a href="Stephen%20Li%C3%A9geard">Stephen Liégeard</a>.

Death and legacy.
Charles de Wendel was made a knight of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a>.
He died on 15 April 1870 in Paris.
In 1834, when Charles de Wendel returned to France, the Wendels produced about 1% of French iron.
By 1870 they produced 11.2%, and were the largest iron operation in France.
At the time of his death, Wendel et Cie employed some 7,000 workers and produced 134,500 tons of <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a> and 112,500 tons of iron a year.
With his death his mother, now 86, was again in charge of the family firm.
After the annexation of Lorraine following the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870, in December 1871 she converted the enterprise from a simple proprietorship to a "société en commandite", Les Petits-files de Francois de Wendel et Cie. Her nine grandchildren were shareholders.
Charles left two sons, Henri de Wendel (1844–1906) and <a href="Robert%20de%20Wendel">Robert de Wendel</a> (1847–1903), who both continued in the steel-making tradition.

The St. Croix Crossing is a <a href="extradosed%20bridge">extradosed bridge</a> that spans the <a href="St.%20Croix%20River%20%28Wisconsin-Minnesota%29">St. Croix River</a>, between <a href="Oak%20Park%20Heights%2C%20Minnesota">Oak Park Heights, Minnesota</a> and <a href="St.%20Joseph%2C%20Wisconsin">St. Joseph, Wisconsin</a>. Connecting <a href="Minnesota%20State%20Highway%2036">Minnesota State Highway 36</a> and <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2064">Wisconsin State Highway 64</a>, the bridge carries four lanes of traffic (two lanes in each direction), and includes a bike/pedestrian path on the north side.

History.
<a href="Minnesota%20Department%20of%20Transportation">MnDOT</a>, <a href="Wisconsin%20Department%20of%20Transportation">WisDOT</a>, and the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> were seeking a replacement for the nearly 90 year old <a href="Stillwater%20Bridge%20%28St.%20Croix%20River%29">Stillwater Bridge</a>, which was frequently congested, inadequate for modern traffic, and was deteriorating from its age. The St. Croix River Crossing Project called for the construction of a new four-lane bridge less than a mile downriver, followed by the conversion of the Stillwater Bridge to pedestrian and bicycle use. Originally, construction of this bridge was planned to start in 2024, but legislation was passed requiring the Department of Transportation to address aging bridges by 2018, and the start date was moved up to 2013. However, on March 11, 2010, a federal judge ruled that the government had violated its rules in approving the bridge design, which sent the process back to an earlier stage. Because the bridge traverses the <a href="Saint%20Croix%20National%20Scenic%20Riverway">Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway</a>, construction could only proceed following federal legislation which granted an exemption to the <a href="National%20Wild%20and%20Scenic%20Rivers%20System">Wild and Scenic Rivers Act</a>.

Construction on the bridge began with the piers in 2014. The bridge was opened to vehicle traffic following a ribbon-cutting ceremony on August 2, 2017.

Kate E. Griswold

Kate E. Griswold (born ca. 1869) was an American editor, publisher, and proprietor of "Profitable Advertising", a monthly trade journal for advertisers. She was "one of the most respected women in turn-of-the-century advertising".

Griswold made a distinct business success of this publication, which was one of the pioneers in advertising journalism. She also made it a standard authority on advertising and similar subjects. Her work was represented at the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Centennial%20Exposition">World's Fair</a> in an exhibit displaying an array of the covers which appeared on "Profitable Advertising" for years back.

Early years and education.
Kate E. Grisworld was born ca. 1869 in <a href="West%20Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">West Hartford, Connecticut</a>, and passed her early girlhood there. Her ancestry could be traced back through various lines to conspicuous early colonists of her native State, she being also a "<a href="Mayflower">Mayflower</a>" descendant, deriving through both father and mother from <a href="William%20Bradford%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%20governor%29">William Bradford</a>, Governor of <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth Plantation</a>. Her father, John Belden Griswold, was born in 1828, son of Josiah Wells and Mary Ann (Belden) Griswold. Her mother, whose maiden name was Cornelia Arnold Jones, was born at East Hartford in 1830, daughter of Joseph Pantra Jones and his wife, Sarah Comstock.

A brother three years older than Griswold, died in early childhood. He had been the joy of his father's heart, and Griswold came to take this brother's place. The love the father had bestowed on the boy and the pride he took in him were somehow inherited by the little daughter, fortunately for both the father and the child.. So soon as she was old enough, Griswold was this father's shadow wherever he went. She followed him to the fields, she sat uon the reaping machine and drove the horses. She milked the cows, and raised vegetables; she reared chickens and calves. Once, she helped shingle a barn. 

She was educated in the high school of her birth, and took a finishing course at Woodside, a school for young women in <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>. 

Her first money was earned at poultry rearing and vegetable gardening, which she had made financially profitable. At one time, she had 200 to 300 chickens. Her knowledge of the chicken industry enabled her to write with practical intelligence on the subject. When very young, she wrote of chicken and eggs for "The Poultry World" and wrote so well that she was invited to take a desk at its office.

Career.
At the age of 16, she entered the office of "The Poultry World", at Hartford, where she handled much of the correspondence pertaining to the advertising department of that paper. Later, she worked in the office of the National Trotting Association, where her close application resulted in <a href="nervous%20prostration">nervous prostration</a>, which compelled her to retire from the business world for some time. 

When her health recovered, flattering offers were at Griswold's disposal, but she turned from them all to take up the management of the organ of a local charitable enterprise. To "The Hartford City Mission Record", and to the cause in general which it represented, she devoted herself for the next four years. Toward the close of this period of charitable work, she entered into several prize competitions for advertising designs, carrying off the honors in a number of cases, including a competitive examination of 800 applicants, Grlawold winning because she wrote rapidly and showed herself to possess a high, degree of general business acumen. The attention which this attracted -a woman's success as an "ad" writer- led to an offer from <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, as general ad writer and correspondent in the office of the C. F. David Advertising Agency.

Soon demonstrating her fitness as as editor, C. F. David Advertising Agency engaged her to edit "Profitable Advertising". The agency could not make a success of the publication, and finally it was turned over to Griswold as a failure. She would not give up, however, and after dealing with difficulties, she made it a success, and all this in the face of the fact that there were several well-established journals of the same character in the field prior to the time she entered it.

Love of outdoor life made her something of a golfer and fisherwoman.
Advice.
“What methods have I used?" said Griswold. “Why, honest ones, I hope. I have tried to make a good publication and sell it upon its merits. That has been my formula of success. Difficulties? Well, I have known what it is to live on three dollars a week. It has not been all plain sailing. But there has always been plenty of encouragement to go on, and at present my journal is on an extremely satisfactory footing. No, I don’t think that a woman has any advantage over a man in the publishing field—certainly she had many disadvantages ten years ago, for women had not begun to do so large a share of the world’s work, and when she went into business there were many who looked askance at her efforts. Those days are past, happily, and now she is on an equal footing with men—is at liberty to go ahead unquestioned and do the best that lies in her. In the advertising field there are probably as good opportunities as in other departments of business. In fact, there are some notably successful women in advertising and publishing. Miss Keyes, of the Semi—ready Clothing Company, is one right here in New York, while in Chicago there is Mrs. Dr. Ellen Sage, who was formerly with the J. Walter Thompson agency, and who is now an independent ad writer. In publishing, there are Miss Caro M. Clarke and Miss Helen Winslow, of Boston. Miss Clarke has been very successful as a publisher of fiction, and was almost the first to use billboard advertising as a medium for exploiting novels. Women are successful as advertising solicitors, while in ad writing there are many lines that she can handle to better advantage than men provided she has equal ability. Her viewpoint gives her certain advantages, of course, but it is all a matter of ability. The day is gone when she can be classed by herself. The February issue of "Profitable Advertising" is to be a woman’s number, dealing with her work in the field of publicity, and I think that it will be something of a revelation. As for the woman who wishes to embark in advertising — well, if she has ability, I believe it better for her to enter upon actual work as the associate of an advertising manager. Real experience transcends all theory. Such positions almost invariably give her experience of retail advertising, which seems to be the natural point of beginning in an advertising career. Retail advertising operations bring one into close touch with readers. You fire at short range and fire often, and the experience gained is invaluable in general publicity." 
Griswold said: "There are many phases in the advertising business—many and varied places which can be and are being filled advantageously by both men and women. But in this, as in other lines of business, results count. In order to bring the science of advertising to bear upon a certain line of business in such a manner as to turn the pockets of the reading public inside out, ability to speak or to write the "King's English" to perfection, sketch an attractive illustrative feature or arrange a pleasing type display are not as essential as might be supposed to the person occupying the place of advertisement writer, designer, agent or solicitor. All these things are important in their way. The chief essential is good, sound business sense, a knowledge of the business to be exploited and of the condition of the market, and such a fund of general information pertaining to the business world as can only be acquired through actual experience and close contact with it. Before one can reach the point where her services are really valuable, in a commercial sense, the student must climb many rounds of the ladder and pass through a variety of experiences."
"Profitable Advertising".
"Profitable Advertising" absorbed Charles Austin Bates’ "Current Advertising", together with "Returns", of <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and opened a <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> office besides the Boston office on Nassau Street. Of more than 200 advertising publications that were launched at various times during the years 1888-1903, approximately 30 continued to publish and were listed in the American Newspaper Directory. She became the owner of "Profitable Advertising" in 1895. Founded as an organ for the C. F. David advertising agency in 1891, it ran indifferently for a year, when Griswold took editorial charge. There was not much of a foundation for a successful periodical when the agency went out of existence in 1895, but Griswold she put the publication upon an independent editorial and business basis, and maintained the journal on that basis thereafter, gradually evolving a successful monthly that was circulated upon its merits and filled a very tangible need in the advertising world. Where advertisers take two trade journals those two are pretty certain to be "Profitable Advertising" and George P. Rowell's "Printer's Ink".
Griswold's "Profitable Advertising" and "Selling Magazine" published by Emerson P. Harris, were merged in June 1909 into one magazine as "Advertising-Selling". George French, for many years editor of "Profitable Advertising", continue in the office of editor-in-chief with A. Eugene Bolles as general manager. Bolles had previously been with "Housefurnishing Review". The main office of the new publication were at 253 Broadway, New York. The Harris-Dibble Company effected the consolidation.

She also designed some sets and costumes for opera and ballet.

Education and family.
Florence Kate Kingsford was born in <a href="Canterbury%2C%20England">Canterbury, England</a>, the daughter of Annie Harriette (Mosley) Kingsford and Charles Tomson Kingsford, a financial agent. She studied at the <a href="Central%20School%20of%20Arts%20and%20Crafts">Central School of Arts and Crafts</a>, where she learned techniques of medieval manuscript illumination, such as applying gold leaf to <a href="parchment">parchment</a>.

In 1906, Cockerell went to Egypt to work for the archaeologist <a href="Flinders%20Petrie">Flinders Petrie</a>, making drawings of his finds. While there, she produced an illuminated version of an ancient Egyptian text attributed to the pharaoh <a href="Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a> and translated by <a href="Francis%20Llewellyn%20Griffith">Francis Llewellyn Griffith</a>. The resulting manuscript, "The Illuminated Hymn to Aten the Sun-Disc", features boldly composed paintings of everyday life painted in Cockerell's typically refined style, paired with calligraphic text. It is now in the collection of the <a href="Fitzwilliam%20Museum">Fitzwilliam Museum</a>.

In 1908, Cockerell created an illuminated version of "The Story of a Hunter" by <a href="Olive%20Schreiner">Olive Schreiner</a>. Again featuring delicate paintings complemented by bold calligraphy, this manuscript is in the collection of the Getty Center, Los Angeles.

In 1914, her work was exhibited at the <a href="Louvre%20Museum">Louvre Museum</a>.

In 1916, Cockerell was diagnosed with <a href="multiple%20sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a>, which effectively ended her career as an illuminator and calligrapher because of the degree to which it affected her hand coordination.

Theater designs.
Cockerell designed sets for a 1913 production of <a href="Mozart">Mozart</a>'s opera "<a href="The%20Magic%20Flute">The Magic Flute</a>" conducted by <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Thomas Beecham</a>. The following year, she was commissioned to design both sets and costumes for a production of <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>'s opera "<a href="The%20Fairy-Queen">The Fairy-Queen</a>".

At Colonel Hooe’s death (1726), the ferry was inherited and run by his son John (1704–1766), and following John’s death by John’s widow, Ann Alexander Hooe, and their son Gerard Hooe (1733–1786), who married Sarah Barnes (1742–1815) and lived at the family home of Barnsfield in Mathias Neck, Stafford County.

Joseph F. DeMartini

Joseph F. DeMartini (born February 13, 1927) is a watercolor artist, who paints pin-up girls. He was born and raised in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, California. He was a friend and contemporary of famed <a href="Alberto%20Vargas">Alberto Vargas</a>. He mentored several artists, including Ted Kimer, a watercolor pin-up artist. Below is a personal statement by Joseph F. DeMartini:

"I was born in 1927 in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="California">California</a> and began drawing and painting at an early age and attended the <a href="University%20of%20San%20Francisco">University of San Francisco</a>. My earliest influence was the illustration of <a href="George%20Petty">George Petty</a>, but after seeing the works of <a href="Alberto%20Vargas">Alberto Vargas</a> in the 1940’s, I discovered my calling in the art of pin-up illustration. I met <a href="Alberto%20Vargas">Alberto Vargas</a> in 1951 and began a close friendship that lasted until Vargas’ death in 1982. Over the years Vargas remained a source of inspiration for me. In the 1950’s, I attended workshops with <a href="Thomas%20Leighton">Thomas Leighton</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> though I consider myself largely self-taught in the techniques of watercolor and airbrush. My work includes fashion illustration, calendar girls, and pin-ups. I maintain a studio in the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a> and continue to draw and paint."
Early life.
During his early childhood, Joe suffered from polio starting at age 2. Doctors performed many operations on him, and he had to use casts, crutches and braces until he was 13 and could finally walk on his own. At the early age of 8, Joe was living in the <a href="Castro%20District">Castro District</a> of San Francisco when his mother gave him a pencil and paper, and told him “draw something,” to keep him busy while they had company over. This is when he started doodling and began his artistic journey. Joe grew up with <a href="Big%20Little%20Books">Big Little Books</a>, which depicted comic style pictures of characters such as <a href="Flash%20Gordon">Flash Gordon</a> and cowboys, and he would copy the pictures. In 1940, Joe was coming home from school and saw a <a href="George%20Petty">George Petty</a> painting on a billboard of a beautiful girl holding a beer, and that’s when he decided that he wanted to paint beautiful women. From then on Joe practiced this by copying girls from calendars. Eventually, Joe learned to draw from memory.

Career.
Beyond his adolescence, Joe worked for a living in jobs such as clerk and messenger at Shopping News newspaper in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Therefore, he had to work on his art during after hours. Joe first started working with colored pencils in 1946. He managed to sell 4 colored pencil and pastel works for $10 a piece. One of his bosses even bought one from him. Not long after, Joe started using models when his best friend’s sister posed for him in several pictures. Joe continued working with colored pencils and pastels until he switched to watercolor and airbrush in the late 50s. He did his first complete watercolor painting in 1963, and went pure watercolor in the 70s. The core of his art career spanned from this time until the early 90s. <a href="Alberto%20Vargas">Alberto Vargas</a> was Joe´s greatest influence in his work. However, according to Joe, Vargas never shared his artistic secrets with him contrary to what commentators have stated. While Joe considers himself Vargas’s protégé, Vargas only contributed to his work by providing critiques.

Notable women sketched and painted by Joseph F. DeMartini include <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, <a href="Kim%20Novak">Kim Novak</a>, and <a href="Rita%20Hayworth">Rita Hayworth</a>. 

Joe has had several of his works sold through <a href="Heritage%20Auctions">Heritage Auctions</a>.

DeMartini and Vargas.
In 1951, Joe went to a hat shop in San Francisco, and there were 3 <a href="Alberto%20Vargas">Alberto Vargas</a> prints advertising the hats. He was impressed with Vargas’s artwork and got in touch with him through <a href="Esquire%20magazine">Esquire magazine</a>. They maintained a relationship with each other over the telephone until Joe took a plane for the first time to visit Vargas and his wife in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in 1956. They remained friends all the way up until Vargas passed away in 1982.

Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves.


Swifts.
Order: <a href="Apodiformes">Apodiformes</a>Family: <a href="Apodidae">Apodidae</a>

The swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.


Hummingbirds.
Order: <a href="Apodiformes">Apodiformes</a>Family: <a href="Trochilidae">Trochilidae</a>

Hummingbirds are small birds capable of hovering in mid-air due to the rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly backwards.

Bhatti Rajput

Bhatti (Hindi: भाटी) is a Chandravanshi Rajput origin and is one of the largest tribes among Rajputs.

In Jaisalmer, Bhatti clan refer to themselves as the Yadavpati, reflecting their claimed mythological descent from Krishna and the Yadu or Yadav. They reside for the most part in Rajasthan, Punjab,Sindh. The Bhatti are also found in Uttar Pradesh. They are divided into about forty gotras or clans of Rajputs. Muslim Bhattis and their vibrant tribes can be found throughout the regions of the Indus River Valley

Geographical Distribution.
Gujarat.
In Gujarat Bhattis are descendants of 12th-century immigrants from Jodhpur and Jaisalmer districts in Rajasthan. Most of them either assisted the Rathore of Jodhpur to capture Idar or were their relatives.
Bhatti Rajputs are also found, though few in numbers in the Rann of Kachchh, where they migrated from Rajasthan in the 18th century.

Punjab (India).
The Patiala and East Punjab States Union has a large concentration of 
Bhatti Rajputs, are in the villages Sahlon, Ghurial (Jalandhar), Phuglana, Salah, Daroli, Machhli Kalan, Lalru, Jhawansa, Tardak, Joli, Samgoli Nagla, Jhhanjeri, Cholta, Badali, Rangian, Magra, Gunnoo Bhattian, and Khellan-mallan.

Rajasthan.
In Rajasthan, they are found in the Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Barmer, and some tehsils of Gurdaspur, Shergarh Udaipur (Mohi) and Nagaur (Gaaju, Ladnun).

Uttar Pradesh.
There are about 365 villages of Bhatti Gujjars in the district of NOIDA, Bulandshahar, Jamalpur, Ghaziabad andMeerut.
In Uttar Pradesh there are several villages where Bhatis reside. These areKakrala in Budaun district, Yahiyapur in Pratapgarh district, Bhargain in Etah district, and Thiriya Nizamat Khan in Bareilly district. In Awadh, the Bhatti of Awadh form a distinct Muslim Rajput community.

South India.
In Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu people of caste “Bhatraju” are considered to have come from Kshatriya blood line of Pandavas. Chandravansh Kshatriyas Vikramaditya and Bhatti denote some of the known ancestral origins of this community and that’s where part of the name Bhat comes from.
The Bhatti residing in the village of Killianwali, tehsil Malout, Muktsar district, and Shergarh (tehsil Dabwali, Sirsa District, Haryana) have adopted the Sikh religion.

Pakistan.
In the Punjab (Pakistan), Bhatti Rajputs are found in Nankana Sahib,Jhang, Gujranwala, Mandi Bahauddin, Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujrat,Jhelum,Gujarkhan, Shahdadpur, Chakwal, Sialkot, Sahiwal, Okara, Sargodha, Fateh Jang (Hattar), Talagang, Hafizabad, Narowal, Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan,Rahim Yar Khan, Multan, Lodhran, Khanpur, Liaquatpur, Rawalpindi andBahawalnagar, Vehari, Pakpattan, Kotmurad district Sheikhupura, Sheikhupuracities of the Punjab.

In Sindh they are found in the districts of Sukkur, Ghotki, Hyderabad,Nawabshah, Sanghar, Tando Adam, Thatta, Dadu, Hala, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas,Shahdadpur, Tharparkar, i.e. Mithi and Bhit Island, in Karachi.

In Kashmir they are found in Dhal Qazian, Surrol, Malot, Rangla and Dheerkot in Bagh District. They are also found in Muzaffar Abad, Rawalakot and Poonch.

Sub Tribes in the Indus River Valley.
Sub-clans in Punjab.
There are about forty sub branches of the Bhatis. Many Rajput , Jats and Gujjar tribes trace their origin to the Bhattis. Some of these tribes include Mair Rajputs of Punjab, Rajput Jenjer/Janjar, Rajput Mers of Kathiawar, Rajputs of the Bajju clan as well as the famed Jats of the Sidhu dynasty (currently ruling Patiala), Khaira, Brar, Ghuman, Sahasi, Sansis and Mane clans.Manj Rajputs are also Bhattis.Alpial,Indhar(from which the Rais of Bhong are), Kalyar, Kanjun, Uttera, Noon, Dhandla, Wattu, Bhabha, Diyal, Mittru, and Hattar. In west punjab Narma / Narwa Rajputs.

Sub-clans in Sindh.
In Sindh the major clans of Bhattis are the Dadani, Mahar, Mangrio, Bhutto, Kamario, Rajpar, Bhamban and Indhar. All Bhattis are related to Samma clans as they are Yadubansi too. For example, Abro‘s sub-clans (Mungrani, Kehar, Odho, Sarki, Bhootani, Pechoho, Unar, Khuhro, Bhayo,Junejo, and Phulpoto) are related to Bhattis.

Physiocrine

Physiocrines are the extracellular signaling regions or alternatively spliced variants of <a href="aminoacyl%20tRNA%20synthetase">aminoacyl tRNA synthetase</a>s (aaRSs) that modulate a range of cellular activities to maintain <a href="homeostasis">homeostasis</a>. [1][2][3][4] AARSs were once generally thought to only facilitate in protein synthesis by catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNAs to their correct amino acid. [5] Since 1999, researchers have demonstrated that AARSs have functional roles outside of protein synthesis due to the extracellular signaling regions and splice variants of aaAARS. [6][7] Those functional roles include regulation of gene expression, angiogenesis, cellular signaling, and immune modulation.

Discovery and Naming.
In 1999, <a href="Paul%20Schimmel">Paul Schimmel</a>, Ph.D., and colleagues discovered that aaRSs can possess proteins that act as extracellular ligands to modulate cell activity. Since then, many more functions for AARSs have been described both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

In 2005, Dr. Schimmel and Xiang-Lei Yang, Ph.D., founded <a href="aTyr%20Pharma">aTyr Pharma</a>, a biotechnology company based on the therapeutic potential of these extracellular regions in AARSs to restore health to dysfunctional tissue. To distinguish between the translational and nontranslational functions of aaRS the extracellular signaling regions and splice variants of aaRSs were coined Physiocrines; "physio" for life and "crine" for specific activity.

Evolution of Physiocrines.
For over 4 billion years, the core function and structure of aaRSs for protein synthesis have remained primarily unchanged in most organisms. However, as organisms became more complex they acquired additional aaRS domains that are thought to have important function outside of protein synthesis.

Functions of Physiocrines.
Physiocrines can act intracellularly to regulate gene expression or be released from cells in response to stimuli such as starvation-induced apoptotic stress or the introduction of certain cellular ligands, including <a href="tumor%20necrosis%20factor%20alpha">tumor necrosis factor alpha</a> (TNF-α) and <a href="vascular%20endothelial%20growth%20factor">vascular endothelial growth factor</a> (VEGF).

Physiocrine Pathways as Potential Therapeutic Targets.
The specific regulatory capability of Physiocrines makes this class of proteins potential candidates for several therapeutic applications. A study conducted by researchers at The Scripps Laboratories for tRNA Synthetase, <a href="Hong%20Kong%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a> and <a href="aTyr%20Pharma">aTyr Pharma</a> on the functions of extracellular regions and alternatively spliced variants of Physiocrines have helped to define potential roles of hundreds of Physiocrines in cellular pathways and provide direction for therapeutic development.

Emergency childbirth

Emergency childbirth is the birth of an infant in places or situations other than what was planned. In most cases the location of childbirth is planned ahead of time and may be at home, hospital, medical facility or birthing center. In other situations, the birth occurs on the way to these facilities. Oftentimes, no trained medical personnel are present. This sometimes occurs with police and paramedics present. Emergency measures are indicated when childbirth is imminent.

Preparedness.
Many childbirth education classes cover emergency birth procedures. Parents are trained to leaern the signs of early labor or other indications that may require assistance. Caregivers can a class on infant and child life support. Some recommend having a kit of emergency supplies in the home; such as, clean towels, sheets, clean scissors, sterile gloves, sanitary pads, diapers, and instructions for infant-rescue breathing.

History.
Emergency chilbirth training was provided to armed forces personnel in 1970.

In culture.
The reports of emergency childbirth are typically of general interest. A mobile app was developed in Ethiopia that guides users through the procedures of assisting with an emergency birth.

He was eight years in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, serving at <a href="Redruth">Redruth</a> and <a href="St%20Buryan">St Buryan</a>, and for a time the <a href="Pastoral%20care">cure</a> of <a href="Stapleton%2C%20Bristol">Stapleton</a>, in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Gloucester%20and%20Bristol">diocese of Gloucester and Bristol</a>.

In 1854 he was offered the position of headmaster of <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20College%2C%20Adelaide">St. Peter's College, Adelaide</a>, which he promptly accepted. 
He had in 1846 married Julia Warren Ord (1824–1914), a daughter of Sir <a href="Robert%20Hutchinson%20Ord">Robert Hutchinson Ord</a>, of Grimstead Hall, Essex, and their eldest daughter Eleanora (1847–1901) was suffering consumption, and it was hoped a warmer drier climate would benefit her health.
They left Plymouth on 8 April 1854 and arrived in Adelaide aboard "Daylesford" in July 1854.
The college was in its infancy, with only two habitable classrooms, and a dining hall that doubled as the chapel. There were two masters and 70 students.
For 25 years Farr served as head, with conspicuous ability and success. Among those he influenced were Sir <a href="Denzil%20Ibbetson">Denzil Ibbetson</a>, Ven. Archdeacon <a href="William%20John%20Bussell">W. J. Bussell</a>, Rev. <a href="C.%20Hornabrook">C. Hornabrook</a>, <a href="George%20Leake">George Leake</a> (Premier of Western Australia), Sir <a href="John%20C.%20Bray">John C. Bray</a>; Sir <a href="John%20Downer">John Downer</a>, Dr. <a href="E.%20C.%20Stirling">E. C. Stirling</a>, Sir <a href="Lancelot%20Stirling">Lancelot Stirling</a>, Dr. <a href="William%20Belworthy%20Blue">W. B. Blue</a>; Sir <a href="Richard%20Butler%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Richard Butler</a>, <a href="J.%20S.%20O%27Halloran">J. S. O'Halloran</a>, <a href="T.%20J.%20S.%20O%27Halloran">T. J. S. O'Halloran</a> (father of <a href="Thomas%20Shuldham%20O%27Halloran%20%28lawyer%29">T. S. O'Halloran</a>), and <a href="A.%20Buchanan">A. Buchanan</a>.

Three years after his arrival in Adelaide he was appointed Canon of <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Adelaide">St. Peter's Cathedral</a>, serving in that position concurrently with his College duties, and assisted in laying its foundation stone on 29 June 1869. 

In 1879 Dr. Farr resigned from St. Peter's College, and in 1880 was appointed Archdeacon of the missionary districts in the Diocese of Adelaide, a position which entailed many long and arduous journeys. 
He then served as incumbent of St. Bede's, <a href="Semaphore">Semaphore</a>; St. Michael's, <a href="Mitcham">Mitcham</a>; and St. Luke's, <a href="Whitmore%20Square">Whitmore Square</a>, Adelaide, where he served for 12 years. He was not a great orator or theologian, which may account for his lack of promotion to the higher offices in the Church, but a quiet un-ostentatious worker, good friend and wise counsellor to students, fellow educators and parishioners.

Farr helped found the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a>, and served as warden 1880–1882 and Vice-Chancellor 1887–1893. He continued to serve on the council until his retirement in 1896. He was also an active member of the board of the Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, being Chairman on three occasions between 1869 and 1886.

In 1896 , his health failing, he took a long holiday on Norfolk Island, where one of his daughters was a missionary.

He died at his residence in North Adelaide after some nine years of failing health. His remains were buried at the <a href="North%20Road%20Cemetery">North Road Cemetery</a>, followed by his wife's ten years later. 

Family.
George Henry Farr married Julia Warren Ord (14 August 1824 – 21 April 1914) on 5 February 1846. Julia was a daughter of Sir <a href="Robert%20Hutchinson%20Ord">Robert Hutchinson Ord</a>, of Grimstead Hall, Essex, and a noted social worker for whom Adelaide's <a href="Julia%20Farr%20Centre">Julia Farr Centre</a> was named. Their children included:

The Rev. <a href="John%20Coleridge%20Patteson">John Coleridge Patteson</a> was a cousin.

Buddha chitta mala

Buddha chitta mala commonly referred as 'Bodhi mala', 'bodhi chitta mala' or 'buddha mala' is a string of mala beads that are made from the natural seeds from Buddha chitta plant. "<a href="Ziziphus%20budhensis">Ziziphus budhensis</a>", the scientific name for buddha chitta plant is a species of plant in the <a href="Rhamnaceae">Rhamnaceae</a> family endemic to the <a href="Timal%20region">Timal region</a> of <a href="Kavreplanchok">Kavreplanchok</a> in Central Nepal. 'Buddha chitta' or 'Ziziphus Budhensis' is clearly different from the species of 'Ziziphus' already known to grow in Nepal, and it did not match with the Ziziphus species reported to be found in India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and China.

Natural buddha chitta seed malas are light brown skin in color and have grip like texture. All Buddha chitta mala seeds have distinctive innate symbolic face (mukhi) pattern embedded in them. These symbolic mukhi pattern also comes in various forms for example most common ones are two mukhi pattern, they also come in three, four, five and six mukhi patterns. Buddha chitta mala seed varies in size also. The standard size is 12– 14 mm. There are larger Buddha chitta seeds which can go up to as large as 18 mm and as small as 6 mm which are very hard to find even in Nepal. Smaller seeds are more highly prized than larger ones. The more eye pattern Buddha chitta seeds have and more the size of the mala vary from the standard size, more scarce they are.

Buddha chitta mala garlands are used by Buddhist people for worship to ‘delight Lord Buddha’ and for spiritual peace. As Buddha chitta garlands are of high value and better for the local farmers The Government of Nepal's Ministry of Forestry has established a committee and has begun to distribute the seedling of the plant so as to uplift the economic status of the people living in this area.

The union was organised during 1888 by Leonard Hall, to represent workers constructing the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a>. Initially named the Manchester Ship Canal Navvies Union, Hall was elected as its first secretary, early in 1889, and its membership soon rose above 3,000. However, all its members in Lancashire and Cheshire left in November 1890, forming the Lancashire and Adjacent Counties Labour Amalgamation, and by 1894 the canal was complete, membership falling to only 450. Hall stood down in 1897, and was replaced as secretary by <a href="Tom%20Fox%20%28Labour%20politician%29">Tom Fox</a>.

Under Fox's leadership, the union successfully recruited construction workers on other projects and by 1900 had more than 2,000 members. Due to the changed nature of its membership, it was then renamed as the "British Labour Amalgamation". In 1902, the Lancashire Enginemen, Cranemen and Firemen Electrical and Hydraulic Attendants' Association joined, although most of its former members left again in 1906.

<doc id="54749133" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54749133" title="Marry-your-rapist law">
Marry-your-rapist law

A marry-your-rapist law, marry-the-rapist law or rape-marriage law is a <a href="laws%20regarding%20rape">law regarding rape</a> that states that a <a href="rapist">rapist</a> will not be <a href="prosecuted">prosecuted</a> if he <a href="marriage">marries</a> his <a href="Effects%20and%20aftermath%20of%20rape">victim</a>. Although the terms for this phenomenon were only coined in the 2010s, the practice has been supported by the rape laws in many legal systems throughout history. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the remaining laws of this type were increasingly challenged and repealed in a series of countries. 

Background.
In patriarchal societies, a <a href="Family%20honor">family’s honour</a> is often deeply linked to a woman’s chastity. Proponents of rape-marriage laws argue that they shield the survivor and her family from the shame of rape. Opponents claim the laws promote impunity for rape, and further victimise rape survivors. Thus, the "social" value of women, as proponents assign to family honour, female chastity and marital status, clashes with opponents' claim of women's right to "individual" happiness, freedom and sexual autonomy.

History.
Traditionally, the marriage of the perpetrator and the victim after the rape was often seen as an appropriate 'resolution' of the situation. One such provision can be found in the <a href="Bible">Biblical</a> <a href="Book%20of%20Deuteronomy">Book of Deuteronomy</a> 22:28-29 (written around the 7th century BCE), wherein sexual intercourse between a man and an unbetrothed virgin woman outside the city is considered wrongful. Irrespective of whether or not the woman had given consent to the sexual act, or will give consent to marriage, the man is given the option of marrying her by paying her parents a <a href="dowry">dowry</a> to settle the matter.

In <a href="medieval%20Europe">medieval Europe</a>, for example, a man could 'rape' a woman, after which she could choose or be pressured to marry her attacker, because she was considered to be a damaged commodity, diminishing her marital prospects. In this specific context, however, the term 'rape' could also refer to <a href="elopement">elopement</a>: a woman would give her consent to being abducted by the man she loved, and thus avoid asking permission from her parents to marry him.

Citing <a href="Bible">Biblical</a> injunctions (particularly <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a> 22:16–17 and <a href="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> 22:25–30), <a href="Calvinist%20Geneva">Calvinist Geneva</a> (1536–1564) permitted a single woman's father to consent to her marriage to her rapist, after which the husband would have no right to divorce; the woman had no explicitly stated separate right to refuse. Among ancient cultures virginity was highly prized, and a woman who had been raped had little chance of marrying. These laws forced the rapist to provide for their victim.

In several <a href="MENA">Middle Eastern and North African countries</a>, marry-the-rapist laws were adopted in their immediate post-colonial independence years in the mid-20th century. The origins of these laws are to be traced to <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman imperial</a> laws and European (<a href="French%20colonial%20empire">French</a> and <a href="British%20Empire">British</a>) colonial laws.

Marry your-rapist-laws were common around the world until a few decades ago, including in Western countries (such laws existed in Italy until 1981 and France until 1994). As late as 1997, 15 countries in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> had marry-your-rapist laws. By July 2017, marry-your-rapist laws still existed – but were being challenged – in Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, the Philippines, Syria and Tajikistan.

The practice of forcing victims of rape to marry their rapists continues even in many countries where the laws allowing this have been abolished. This is the case, for example, in Ethiopia, where <a href="marriage%20by%20abduction">marriage by abduction</a> remains common, despite it being illegal under the new 2004 Criminal Code. In <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, while formally there is no law, "in practice it is not uncommon for a prosecution to be dropped if marriage is offered by the perpetrator/his family."

Campaigns for repeal.
Several human rights organisations such as <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>, and the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Human%20Rights">United Nations Human Rights High Commission</a> have strongly criticised laws like Article 522 in other parts of the world. These organisations have been working towards abolishing this kind of laws, and in several cases they have been successful.

Bahrain.
Article 353 of the penal code of <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>, dating from 1958, has undergone several amendments since its adoption. It states that if a perpetrator marries the victim before the final sentencing is pronounced, the charges will be dropped and criminal proceedings will be suspended. The law has been under hard criticism from the international community in the early 21st century. Parliament voted to abolish it on 31 May 2016, and the Bahraini government started the discussions of abolishing or reforming Article 353, and reached a final decision to repeal the article. However, the government was still examining the law by December 2016. As of July 2017, the government was only willing to repeal the marriage option in case of a gang rape.

Egypt.
Article 291 of the <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian penal code was abolished by former president <a href="Hosni%20Mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> by means of a presidential decree in 1999. The article was inspired in a French provision and was adopted in 1904. It allowed any individual who committed sexual assault to avoid penalty enforced by law. In order to do so, the individual had to enter into marriage with the female that had undergone the sexual assault.

Jordan.
Article 308 in the <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>ian Penal Code was voted to be abolished by Parliament on 1 August 2017. The article allowed for an aggressor of sexual assault to avoid persecution and punishment if he married the victim. The article was amended in 2016, barring full pardon in cases of rape but keeping a loophole clause that pardoned perpetrators if they married the victim if she is aged between 15 and 18 and if the assault was regarded as “consensual.” Early in 2017, the 10-person Royal Committee for Developing the Judiciary and Enhancing the Rule of Law presented <a href="Abdullah%20II%20of%20Jordan">King Abdullah</a> a report recommending the closing of the loophole. The article was abolished in a "historic vote" by the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Jordan">House of Representatives</a> of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Jordan">Parliament</a> on 1 August 2017.

Lebanon.
In December 2016, the Lebanese non-governmental organization, Abaad MENA, launched the campaign "A White Dress Doesn't Cover the Rape" with the aim to abolish Article 522 of the Lebanese Penal Code, which had been labelled as the "rape law." The campaign included street protests, the <a href="hashtag">hashtag</a> #Undress522 in social media and a video of a raped women covered in bruises turned into a bride.

A month before the launching of the campaign, the NGO executed a country-wide plan to raise awareness on the article to which only 1% of Lebanese population were discerned of. Within the first few weeks of the campaign, influential figures expressed their support for the movement against Article 522, like the Prime Minister, <a href="Saad%20Hariri">Saad Hariri</a>, who did so on his <a href="twitter">twitter</a> account.

In 2017, Lebanon abolished Article 522 and declared reexamination of Articles 505 and 518.

Malaysia.
<a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> does not have any rape-marriage law, but nearly did by judicial ruling in 2015–16. The Sessions Court verdict that a man accused of two counts of statutory rape of a 14-year-old girl from <a href="Petra%20Jaya">Petra Jaya</a> in the <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>n part of <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> in October 2015, would escape punishment because he claimed to have married his victim, was overruled by the <a href="High%20Courts%20%28Malaysia%29">High Court in Sabah and Sarawak</a> in August 2016 after large-scale protests argued this would set a dangerous precedent for child rapists to escape punishment.

Morocco.
In 2012, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> amended Article 475, which provided between one- to five-year prison sentence for a perpetrator that abducted or deceived a minor with no resort to violence or threat, or attempted to do so. The Article included a second clause that permitted to cease the persecution if the assaulter married the girl or woman. Different protests and campaigns took place in Morocco prior to the abolition of the Article. The Parliament abolished the law in 2014 as it was considered to be at odds with the <a href="Moroccan%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%202011">2011 constitution</a>.

Peru.
In 1999 a legislative reform repealed the marriage exception (under which if the perpetrator offered a marriage proposal and the offended/victim accepted, charges of sexual assault would be withdrawn, also since 1991, benefiting co-defenders, too). In 1999, the Peruvian Congress changed the legislation, abolishing the exoneration clause, after the issue had been raised to them.

Uruguay.
Article 116 of the Penal Code and Articles 22 and 23 of the executive order nº 15.032 of <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> were repealed in 2006. The articles stated that in crimes of sexual assault, statutory rape, abduction, and disrespect of modesty, the penalty would be extinguished in cases where the assailant and the victim made a matrimonial contract.

Asian quota

An Asian quota is a type of <a href="racial%20quota">racial quota</a> limiting the number of <a href="Asian%20people">people of Asian descent</a> in an establishment, a special case of <a href="Numerus%20clausus">Numerus clausus</a>. In particular, it refers to alleged <a href="educational%20quotas">educational quotas</a> in United States <a href="higher%20education">higher education</a> <a href="College%20admissions%20in%20the%20United%20States">admissions</a>, specifically <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> universities, targeting <a href="Asian%20American">Asian American</a>s, specifically persons of <a href="East%20Asian%20people">East Asian</a> and <a href="South%20Asian%20people">South Asian</a> descent, starting in the late 1980s and ongoing, ; such allegations are denied by the universities in question. Asian quotas are compared to the earlier <a href="Jewish%20quota">Jewish quota</a>s, which limited admissions of a <a href="model%20minority">model minority</a> from the 1910s to the 1950s, and was denied at the time, but whose existence is now not disputed; some have thus called Asian-Americans "The New Jews" of university admissions.

More generally, by various measures admissions have a <a href="Bias%20%28statistics%29">bias</a> against Asian applicants, though not necessarily a strict quota: for example, successful Asian applicants have on average higher test scores than the overall average. The perceived bias against applicants of Asian descent has been termed a "<a href="bamboo%20ceiling">bamboo ceiling</a>" or "Asian penalty". Alleged Asian quotas have been the subject of government investigations and lawsuits, with some minor conclusions of their existence, though no major judgements, .

Evidence.
The primary evidence in favor of the existence of an Asian quota in United States universities admissions is statistical: over the 1990s and 2000s, when the college-age population of Asian-American roughly doubled (and the overall college-age population increased much less), the percentage of admitted Asian-Americans at Ivy League schools not only declined, but converged to a narrow range across different schools, and has stayed relatively constant from year to year. By comparison, at schools that had race-blind policies, such as in the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> system (notably its prestigious campuses at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">Berkeley</a>, <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a>, <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis">Davis</a>, and <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Irvine">Irvine</a>) and the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a>, Asian-American admissions increased in line with population, and at academic contests, such as <a href="International%20Science%20Olympiad">International Science Olympiad</a>s, Asian representation increased substantially over this period. Regarding Harvard admissions, <a href="Ron%20Unz">Ron Unz</a> writes:

While California is more Asian than other regions of the United States, it admits students nationally and internationally, and thus the above numbers are not solely reflective of regional demographics. By contrast, in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, which has the country's largest urban Asian population, the prestigious <a href="Specialized%20high%20schools%20in%20New%20York%20City">specialized high schools</a> of <a href="Stuyvesant%20High%20School">Stuyvesant High School</a> and <a href="Bronx%20Science">Bronx Science</a> have majority Asian student bodies, which increased over the 1990s and 2000s, but at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, which is in the Ivy League, the Asian undergraduate population fell from 22.7% in 1993 to 15.6% in 2011.

Denial.
Ivy League universities deny that there is an Asian quota. Due to the sensitivity of college admissions and racial preferences generally, and legal concerns (government investigations, court decisions, and ongoing or future litigation), official statements are largely blanket denials, and a defense of holistic admission, rather than specific answers to charges. Some historians and former admissions officers likewise deny that there is an Asian quota or a bias against Asian applicants, or conclude as much.

More generally, the bias in test scores (the fact that successful Asian applicants have higher test scores than successful applicants overall) is ascribed to applicants being judged on more than test scores. Stated formally, rather than higher test scores among successful Asian applicants meaning that an individual Asian applicant must meet a higher bar than an otherwise identical non-Asian applicant, it may simply be a reflection that Asians have "relatively" higher test scores: compared to the overall applicant pool, Asians have higher test scores, and a borderline Asian applicant will have higher test scores, but be lower on other measures, than the average borderline applicant.

History.
Lawsuits.
Racial quotas are illegal in United States college admissions, but race can be used as a factor in admissions decisions (<a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a>), as decided in "<a href="Regents%20of%20the%20Univ.%20of%20Cal.%20v.%20Bakke">Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v.

A 1940 census shows Maurice Braverman, 31, white male American, residing in Brooklyn Assembly District 2. In 1948, his law office was at 15 South Gay Street in Baltimore.

Career.
Braverman was in civil service in several positions from 1939 to 1940. He worked in a post office in Baltimore for a few months. He worked in the U.S. War Department for a few months, and worked in the Bureau of Internal Revenue.

On October 7, 1941, Braverman passed the Maryland Bar and opened on his own office in Baltimore, where he would practice law for the next eleven years.

In 1943, he joined the Communist Party due to his <a href="anti-fascism">anti-fascism</a> and the fact that the USSR was by that time a member of <a href="Allied%20Forces">Allied Forces</a> in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He also stated that the Party provided education. "For the first time, I read history... The Party was a vehicle of great intellectual growth for me, a very rich part of my life."

In the 1940s, Braverman joined Max Angelson, Harry Angelson, and Ida Sperling as plaintiffs-appellants against the <a href="New%20York%20Rapid%20Transit%20Corporation">New York Rapid Transit Corporation</a>.

Hiss Case.
On August 26, 1948, Braverman appeared as counsel for Mr. and Mrs. William Rosen, involved in the sale of a Ford automobile once belonging to <a href="Alger%20Hiss">Alger Hiss</a> during <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC) hearings that were following the allegations of <a href="Elizabeth%20Bentley">Elizabeth Bentley</a> and <a href="Whittaker%20Chambers">Whittaker Chambers</a>.

After a short time, the committee attempted to turn Braverman from counsel to witness: On September 8, 1948, Braverman appeared again before HUAC as counsel to Addie Rosen (Mrs. William Rosen). When Mrs. Rosen continued to refuse to answer questions by pleading the <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a>, the committee again turned on Braverman: On September 9, 1948, Braverman appeared again before HUAC, both as counsel to Rosen and as witness himself. After counseling Rosen, HUAC swore him in. Serving as his counsel were <a href="Joseph%20Forer">Joseph Forer</a> (the best known pro-Communist lawyer in Washington and prominent member of the local chapter of the <a href="National%20Lawyers%20Guild">National Lawyers Guild</a>) and <a href="Mitchell%20A.%20Dubow">Mitchell A. Dubow</a> (future district judge in Minnesota). 
Once on the stand as witness and his background discussed, Braverman found himself accused of Communism: (Albert E. Blumberg (1906 – October 8, 1997) of Baltimore was an American philosopher and political activist. He was an official of the Communist Party for several years before joining the Democratic Party as a district leader.)

In 1950, Braverman's name and address (15 South Gay Street, Baltimore) appeared in a <a href="HUAC">HUAC</a> investigative report, showing him as a member of the <a href="National%20Lawyers%20Guild">National Lawyers Guild</a>.

Arrest, conviction, disbarment.
In April 1951, the trial of <a href="Julius%20Rosenberg">Julius Rosenberg</a> and <a href="Ethel%20Rosenberg">Ethel Rosenberg</a> ended in conviction and death sentence. In the wak of many anti-communist trials (in 1949 alone the <a href="Smith%20Act%20trials%20of%20Communist%20Party%20leaders">Smith Act/Foley Squre</a>, <a href="Judith%20Coplon">Judith Coplon</a>, and <a href="Alger%20Hiss">Alger Hiss</a> trials), the Communist Party's National Committee ordered top leaders to make themselves "unavailable." These included Maryland leader Alfred Blumberg. During the summer of 1951, more than 40 people received subpoenas to appear before HUAC. Hearings ran June 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, and July 11, 13, 1951. During the first six days of hearings, newspapers reported that witnesses balked answering questions.

On July 11, 1951, <a href="Mary%20Stalcup%20Markward">Mary Stalcup Markward</a>, an FBI undercover agent in the Communist Party, testified. (After consulting earlier in the year with HUAC, the Party heard and expelled her in February 1951.) She named Braverman: 

Braverman had already appeared as counsel to Herbert Kransdorf (June 19, 1951), Michael Howard (June 20, 1951), Peter Edward Forrest (June 26, 1951), and Eli Isadore Schwartz (June 28, 1951). Given opportunity to respond to Markward, Braverman's allegation, Braverman stated, ""I wouldn't have an answer to any stool pigeon." U.S. Representative <a href="Francis%20E.%20Walter">Francis E. Walter</a>, a HUAC member, retorted, "You may regard her as a stool pigeon, but I regard her as a great American." Three witnesses before the HUAC alleged that Braverman was a Communist Party member. 

Later during that month, his wife later said, Braverman became aware that <a href="FBI">FBI</a> agents were following him. Thanks to his experience as a taxi cab driver, he was able to elude them by car. On August 7, 1951, fearing imminent arrest, he went to New York to seek advice from an attorney. He recounted later, "He just laughed at me. 'They're arresting leaders. Are you a leader?' 'No.' 'Are you a member of the <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a>.' 'No.' 'Did they arrest 300 members?' 'No, they're just arresting leaders.' 'Then why will they arrest you?' Hearing of the arrest that day of <a href="George%20Meyers">George Meyers</a> and DC branch head <a href="Roy%20Wood">Roy Wood</a>, he flew back to Baltimore: at 1:07 A.M. on August 8, 1951, upon arrival at <a href="Baltimore-Washington%20International%20Airport">Friendly Airport</a> in Baltimore, Braverman was arrested and indicted. Philip Frankfeld and Dorothy Rose Blumberg were arrested in New York, Regina Frankfeld in Cleveland. As historian Vern Pederson has noted, "The six arrests were part of the Justice Department's Smith Act prosecution of local, 'second string' Party leaders from California, Pennsylvania, and Hawaii as well as Maryland." All six posted bail; FBI agents followed them around the clock, seven days a week–even sitting next to them in movies and calling them cabs home. <a href="Harold%20Buchman">Harold Buchman</a> represented the six; <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Maryland">United States Attorney for the District of Maryland</a> Bernard J. Flynn prosecuted.

On April 1, 1952, Braverman and five other alleged Communists were convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland for "conspiracy to teach and advocate and to organize the overthrow of the government by force or violence in violation of §2 of the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C.A. 2385." Prosecutor Flynn called out Braverman in particular as Communist official. Braverman received a fine of $1,000 and a sentence of imprisonment for three years. He served time in <a href="United%20States%20Penitentiary%2C%20Lewisburg">Lewisburg Penitentiary</a> in the same area as Alger Hiss. Meanwhile, his family faced harassment from the FBI. They typically called his wife's place of work every few weeks for no apparent reason [implied: intimidation]. Braverman was released after 28 months and was released on May 19, 1955.

"As the result of a petition filed by the Bar Association of Baltimore City, Braverman was disbarred from the further practice of law by order of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City dated June 28, 1955." Disbarment included both state and federal courts. To earn a living, he became a bookkeeper and accountant to small businesses. He left the Party. He joined other groups: the New Democratic Coalition, St. John's Council on Criminal Justice, and the <a href="Baltimore%20Free%20University">Baltimore Free University</a>.

Reinstatement.
In the early 1970s, Braverman began a long legal battle to regain admission to the bar. He asked the Maryland chapter of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) for help; they agreed. His lawyers included John C. Roemer III of the ACLU, and Stanley Mazeroff.

The ACLU's case for Braverman made national news on January 15, 1974 when filed. The case continued to attract national attention during that year. John F. King served as Braverman's counsel.

On October 1, 1973, the Court of Appeals of Maryland ordered referral of his petition for reinstatement to practice law in the state for an evidentiary hearing to a three-judge panel, which followed on October 15, 1973. The panel recommended reinstatement. On March 1, 1974, the Court of Appeals of Maryland, ordered Maurice L. Braverman reinstated as a member of the Bar of Maryland.

From 1974 to 1976, he continued to seek the right practice in federal court. In 1975, a panel of all of Baltimore's federal judges turned him down by a vote of 6-3. On April 9, 1976, C. Christopher Brown and Harold P. Dwin of Baltimore argued Braverman's case, with the National Lawyers Guild as amicus curiae (Doron Weinberg, Joseph Forer, and David Rein). On November 9, 1976, a federal appellate court in Richmond, Virginia, reversed that decision and he was free to practice in federal courts.

Personal and death.
Braverman married Jeanette Block, with whom he had one daughter (who died in 1991); they divorced. In 1981, he married Myrna Lapides. In 1985, they moved to Israel; in 2000, they returned to Maryland and lived in <a href="Elkton%2C%20Maryland">Elkton</a>. They had one daughter together.
Braverman attributed his arrest and conviction to his calling FBI chief <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a> a "<a href="Faggot%20%28slang%29">fag</a>" on a tapped telephone line.

From at least 1953 through 1972, the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of the Attorney General noted the existence of a "Maurice Braverman Defense Committee." By 1972, the Government had concluded that "Pursuant to section 12(i) of Executive Order 10450 as amended by Executive Order No. 11605, issued July 2, 1971, 36 P.R. 12831, the Attorney General, by counsel, petitions this Board for a determination that the Maurice Braverman Defense Committee has ceased to exist... The last known address of the above-named organization was Box 2616, Arlington Station, Baltimore 15, MD".

In the 1970s, Braverman became assocated with the East Bank Havurah.

Braverman died age 86 of pneumonia in Elkton, Maryland, on March 25, 2002. Myrna Lapides Braverman, a longtime philatelist, died on August 16, 2013.

Legacy.
Communist Party of Maryand.
In 1991, the "Baltimore Sun" ran an article that assessed the state of the Communist Party of Maryland at that time: Baltimore's Communist Party traces it origins to a strike against the <a href="B%26amp%3BO%20Railroad">B&O Railroad</a> in 1877... <br> In the 1930s, Baltimore was designated by national party leaders as District 4 and was made up of about 20 "cells"... <br> The party focused its recruiting on companies with many blue-collar workers... Often, national leaders such as <a href="Earl%20Browder">Earl Browder</a> and <a href="William%20Z.%20Foster">William Z. Foster</a> were guest speakers. The party held rallies... and fielded candidates in local elections... <br> After World War II... most of Baltimore's communists went underground. They maintained low-profile headquarters, successively, on Eutaw Street, Franklin Street and in the 200 block Liberty Street... <br> The communist witch hunts of the late 1940s and early '50s were not among the city's shining hours. In 1949, complying with laws requiring loyalty oaths and federal acts that effectively outlawed the party, city, state and federal authorities began to arrest known communists and to sentence them to jail, often for minor or fabricated crimes. Among those who served time were Maurice Braverman, the party's lawyer; <a href="Leroy%20H.%20Wood">Leroy H. Wood</a>, its treasurer and <a href="George%20A.%20Meyers">George A. Meyers</a>, a long-time local and national party leader. In 1952, Meyers spent 30 days in jail for refusing to name others in the party. One Evening Sun headline of the time: "FBI Informer Calls Meyers Key State Red." <br> What was left of the membership lacked the resources to carry on. Postwar prosperity and ideological differences with Soviet communism proved too much for Baltimore's communists, and the local party all but disappeared...1970s, and winning restatement in Maryland (1974) and federal courts (1975). (Note that the "Sun" calls Braverman a Party lawyer.)

Hiss Case postscript.
After the article "Suspecting Alger Hiss" appeared in the "<a href="New%20York%20Review%20of%20Books">New York Review of Books</a>" on April 20, 1978, Braverman spoke to its author, <a href="Garry%20Wills">Garry Wills</a>. (Wills, formerly a writer for <a href="William%20F.%20Buckley%2C%20Jr.">William F. Buckley, Jr.</a>'s magazine "<a href="National%20Review">National Review</a>", had expressed disbelief in Hiss's innocence, calling him a "man drab with the proper virtues," yet often found "telling odd little needless lies, or suffering inexplicable 'blackouts' of memory.) Calling himself a "civil rights lawyer," Braverman explained that he had served time in the Lewisburg prion with Alger Hiss. When the two met there, Braverman introduced himself as counsel to William Rosen in August 1948, to which Hiss replied curtly, "I know." Wills notes that most innocent people would have expressed great interest in talking to someone who might have details in helping their case. When Hiss was about to be released, Braverman told him the Communist Party would expect him make a statement. Hiss concurred, and Braverman wrote him a first draft. Wills concluded that Hiss "behaved like one still serving the Party."

She had an extreme case of <a href="spina%20bifida">spina bifida</a> that left her grossly deformed and paralysed below the waistline, and she was suffering from brain malformation marked by <a href="hydrocephalus">hydrocephalus</a> that meant she was most likely retarded and would suffer seizures. Within days she developed severe breathing issues.

Neonatal physician Peter Loughnan informed her parents of their daughter's poor outlook and the low quality of life she would face if she survived. He recommended the parents consider a "conservative treatment, in which Allison would be cuddled, fed and relieved of any pain," with no life-saving measures performed. He consulted with other specialists, including fellow neonatal physician Peter McDougall, who "strongly supported" Loughnan's assessment of the infant. They believed any surgery would be futile.

After consulting two Catholic priests and seeking guidance from relatives, Allison's parents agreed with the doctor's recommendation.

A relative informed the Victorian <a href="Right%20to%20Life">Right to Life</a> association of the parents' decision to withhold lifesaving treatment upon advice of medical staff. When Allison was seven days old, the activists arrived at Royal Children's Hospital and demanded to see her parents, announcing they wanted to adopt her. When this was unsuccessful, the activists called the police and told them a baby was being drugged and starved to death at the hospital, causing detectives to investigate. After Allison's death at 12 days old, the Right to Life group accused the parents and the doctors of murdering her.

Inquest and rule of law.
In addition to media and public attention, the case was particularly unique as the medical practice of withdrawing life-saving treatment from the baby lacked "explicit legal backing" in Australia. In actuality, in a similar 1986 case, <a href="Frank%20Vincent%20%28judge%29">Justice Frank Vincent</a> of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Victoria">Supreme Court of Victoria</a> ordered the same hospital to take "all necessary means" to save a nine-day-old baby boy suffering from spina bifida. During the 1986 case, Justice Vincent ruled that nobody "has any power to determine that the life of any child, however disabled that child may be, will be deliberately taken away from it ... [The law] does not permit any decisions to be made concerning the quality of life, nor does it enable ... any assessment to be made as to the value of any human being." In that case, the grandparents had sought legal means to keep the baby alive, and Justice Vincent made the baby a ward of the court. However, the doctors and hospital did not present their side to the court or provide evidence to explain their recommendation.

In 1991, a hearing into the Baby M case lasted five months. The Deputy Coroner Wendy Wilmoth ruled that Allison had died of natural causes, and chastised the Right to Life group. "The decisions made by her doctors and her parents, and the careful steps taken to ensure these decisions were legally, ethically and morally sound, have been tested and found entirely reasonable and appropriate," Wilmoth stated. The child's parents and the medical staff were exonerated of all wrongdoing.

Television journalist <a href="Jill%20Singer">Jill Singer</a>'s coverage of the case and inquest, a report entitled, "Baby M", was broadcast on the "<a href="The%207.30%20Report">The 7.30 Report</a>" in 1992. It once again brought the case to the public, which prompted the Victorian Law Reform Commission to introduce new guidelines for doctors and parents in dealing with disabled and sick newborn babies. Singer won the <a href="Walkley%20Awards">Walkley Award for Best Investigative Report</a> for "Baby M".

Later developments.
In 2010, Allison's parents gave Drs Loughnan and McDougall permission to speak publicly about the case, which they did at a medical ethics conference, "Tackling Ethical Dilemmas in Intensive Care."

Disney on Parade (stage show)

Disney on Parade, was a series of touring <a href="arena">arena</a> <a href="stage%20show">stage shows</a> produced by NAWAL Productions, a <a href="joint%20venture">joint venture</a> between <a href="NBC">NBC</a> and <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Walt Disney Productions</a>. Aimed primarily at children and families, the shows featured live performers portraying the roles of <a href="Disney">Disney</a> characters in performances derived from various Disney films.

History.
The initial idea for "Disney on Parade" was convinced by Thomas Sarnoff, who was then president of the NBC television network, which aired Walt Disney Productions' <a href="Walt%20Disney%20anthology%20television%20series">weekly anthology series</a>. To produce the show, Disney teamed with the network to create NAWAL Productions, with NBC being the general partner and Disney the limited partner.

Following a trial run in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a>, the first edition of "Disney on Parade" launched in <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> on December 25, 1969 and was an instant success. However, the show suffered from an overabundance of props, inexperienced performers, high costs and a run time of nearly three hours, so NBC replaced producer <a href="Bob%20Jani">Bob Jani</a> with Michel M. Grilikhes, who made effective changes, including rearranging or removing acts, to reduce costs and time without affecting the show's quality. Grilikhes, affectionately known to the cast and crew as "Mr. G", would executive-produce and direct further editions of "Disney on Parade".

Four editions of "Disney on Parade", each with a different set of acts, would tour across the United States and around the world, including runs in South America, Europe, Asia and Australia; a performance in <a href="Adelaide%2C%20Australia">Adelaide, Australia</a> was videotaped and broadcast as a one-hour special on NBC's "The Wonderful World of Disney" in December 1971. By 1976, the shows ceased performing internationally.

Format.
Each edition of "Disney on Parade" typically began with <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> and a cavalcade of Disney characters dancing on the stage and personally greeting members of the audience. The show would then present lavish musical segments, depicting characters and scenes from Disney movies, alongside smaller comedy routines with characters like <a href="Donald%20Duck">Donald Duck</a>, <a href="Goofy">Goofy</a> and <a href="Herbie">Herbie the Love Bug</a>. Finally, the characters appeared together for a grand finale and bid the audience farewell. Each show was divided into two acts with one 15-minute <a href="intermission">intermission</a>.

The arena stages typically sported giant a curtain from which characters and sets would emerge, and a circular motion picture screen that would present clips from Disney features and shorts at the beginning of major acts.

Reception.
"Disney on Parade" was well-received by audiences and critics. The first edition's run at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> made a record $400,000 in advanced ticket sales, and a run in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a> booked 77,255 people in nine days.

Reception.
On <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a>, Dan McClenaghan called it "A superior piano trio outing with bonus of Iggy Pop's cool contributions". In the <a href="Colorado%20Springs%20Independent">Colorado Springs Independent</a> Bill Kopp wrote "The trio of Saft, bassist Steve Swallow and drummer Bobby Previte turns in some unexpectedly accessible (and not at all avant-garde) jazz. And when Pop joins them on “Don’t Lose Yourself,” “Everyday” and the title track, he delivers a gravelly, wavering vocal that is more Leonard Cohen than Stooges. Because it may mystify jazz fans and Iggy acolytes in equal measure, an open mind is necessary when listening to "Loneliness Road"".

The Great Battles (series)

The Great Battles is a <a href="Wargame%20%28video%20games%29">computer wargame</a> series based on the "<a href="Great%20Battles%20of%20History">Great Battles of History</a>" board game series by <a href="GMT%20Games">GMT Games</a>. The three titles in the series—"The Great Battles of Alexander", "The Great Battles of Hannibal" and "The Great Battles of Caesar"—were developed by <a href="Erudite%20Software">Erudite Software</a> and published by <a href="Interactive%20Magic">Interactive Magic</a>.


Development history.
<a href="Interactive%20Magic">Interactive Magic</a> announced the completion of "The Great Battles of Caesar" on March 11, 1998, and it was released on the 26th.

According to "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Strategy Plus</a>", the "Great Battles" games were "very well received by wargamers", and were successful enough that Interactive Magic worked with Erudite Software again to produce the wargame "<a href="North%20vs.%20South">North vs. South</a>". This game was built with an updated version of the engine used in the three "Great Battles" games.

Reception.
The Great Battles of Alexander.
"<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>"s Jim Cobb wrote, "The seamless interface, useful graphics, great history, and well-written and thorough manual make "Alex" simply the best-ever ancients system. It's also one of the most innovative strategy games about any era." While he criticized its slow performance, and its lack of a playable Alexander unit or <a href="fog%20of%20war">fog of war</a>, Cobb called the game "an otherwise flawless product." Robert Mayer of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Strategy Plus</a>" wrote of "Alexander"s gameplay, "[F]or a boardgame conversion, this is as good as it gets." He praised its sound design and called the game a "visual feast". While Mayer found the <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) spotty, he summarized the game as "one that wargamers (and others!) will want for their collection."

The Great Battles of Hannibal.
Scott Udell of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Strategy Plus</a>" called "Hannibal" an improvement upon its predecessor, in that it retained "Alexander"s best features while fixing its worst. He praised it as "a wonderfully refreshing play aesthetic that few recent wargames have approached, let alone matched." In "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>", William R. Trotter likewise praised the game and compared it positively to "Alexander". Describing "Hannibal"s place in the "Great Battles" series, he summarized, "It is perhaps unwise to suggest that any wargame is 'the last word' on a given subject [...] but it's hard to imagine how these three games could be outclassed in the foreseeable future."

In a less positive review, "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>"s Ron Talbot wrote that ""Hannibal" marks a step back from "Alex"." He found its campaign "unimaginative" and noted significant technical problems, which he considered "unforgivable in the second iteration of a series."

The Great Battles of Caesar.
"<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>"s Jim Cobb called "Caesar" "not only the best of the "Great Battles" series to date, it's also the most realistic ancients-era game yet on the PC." While he found its graphics middling, and noted that the slow performance continued from its predecessors, Cobb summarized, "If you're willing to put up with its eccentricities, "Caesar" does a remarkable job of recreating ancient warfare." Mark H. Walker of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Strategy Plus</a>" wrote that "Caesar" is "fun, challenging, and mildly addictive", but also "annoyingly flawed and somewhat dated." Like Cobb, he criticized the game's slow performance, and called the campaign mode "as strategically challenging as a game of "<a href="Chutes%20and%20Ladders">Chutes and Ladders</a>"." Walker summarized "Caesar" as "worth a look".

"The Great Battles of Caesar" was the runner-up for "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>"s 1998 "Best Wargame" award, which ultimately went to "<a href="The%20Operational%20Art%20of%20War">The Operational Art of War</a>". The editors wrote of "Caesar", "With improved graphics, aggressive AI, a solid campaign, and an excellent scenario editor, it's the best ancients game in more than a decade for the PC."

Lithospermum parviflorum

Lithospermum parviflorum, commonly called Eastern Prairie Marbleseed, is a species of flowering plant in the <a href="Boraginaceae">forget-me-not family</a>. It is native to the eastern North America.

This species is a robust perennial. It produces a <a href="Cyme%20%28botany%29">cyme</a> of cream colored flowers in late spring and early summer.

Although widespread, this species is spotty and uncommon throughout much of its range. Its preferred habitat, somewhat dry calcareous woodlands, barrens, and glades, has been heavily impacted by agriculture and other land-use changes. The only area this species is considered secure in is the <a href="Ridge%20and%20Valley">Ridge and Valley</a> region of Virginia and West Virginia. In Kentucky, this species has disappeared from many previously known localities since the 1980s. In Missouri, it has been known to be in decline since the 1950s.

It can be distinguished from the similar looking "<a href="Lithospermum%20bejariense">Lithospermum bejariense</a>" by having shorter corollas (6-10mm) and nutlets that form a collar around the base. It can be distinguished from the <a href="cedar%20glade">cedar glade</a> endemic "<a href="Lithospermum%20molle">Lithospermum molle</a>" by having leaves with erect pustular-based hairs. Some rare collections from southern Kentucky appear to be intermediate with "Lithospermum molle".

Reception.
In his review for <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>, Thom Jurek notes that "What is at work on Red Hill is the voice of a creative and surprisingly unified anarchy. There is plenty of firepower, but this is no skronk session ... the music is allowed to develop and unfold unhurriedly. There are no duels, or teams engaging in competitive musical athletics. These four highly individual voices all contribute to a vast conversation that contains many multiple utterances inside what is revealed as a bracing, new, but common language. "Red Hill" is avant-garde jazz at its best; on the spot, its players continually reinvent themselves and the music". On <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a>, John Sharpe said "Together they create six intense and densely voiced collective improvisations. Ambient mood and texture is as important as rhythm or counterpoint. Pandi in particular forces the pace with his non-stop barrage, as bass and drums form a clattering wall of sound. Saft's keyboards variously match or oppose and at times he resorts to a series of glissandos to cut through. Smith meanwhile is imperious, interacting with the others predominantly by taking an opposing stance The default position is manifest in the tension generated by the contrast between Smith's poised trumpet fanfares and the choppy continuous backing". On <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> Will Layman observed ""Red Hill" sets its sights for the horizon. The rhythm section of Saft, Morris, and Pandi is extremely inventive, providing washes of color and texture that move beneath Smith like an undulating sea.".

Tuyo (album)

Tuyo is the seventeenth studio album by <a href="Camilo%20Sesto">Camilo Sesto</a>. The first audio CD Cassette release was in 1985. Co-produced by P. Robles, the album contains three successful singles; beginning with, "Ven o Voy", as well as "Soy Un Loco Sincero" and "Maldito Destino", which reached "The Billboard Top 40" at the time.

Background.
After the rushed release of "Amanecer 84" (Ariola, 1984) Camilo Sesto would soon release an album the next year in which would be considered by many a return to forum. Once more, there were melodies with business start and some creativity in their courses of action. The primary track is recorded live deliberately to pass on the delight among fans. That the instrumentation and production advancements is clear in "Ven o Voy," a well-done track with synthesizer tones and different consoles and a Camilo with less voice than toward the start of his profession, yet overseeing exceptionally well the one he had left at his age. Mood wavers for "Soy Un Loco Sincero", a melody with which Camilo, on the precarious edge of 40, appears to need to be homologated with the music of the most youthful. Another tune that merits a mindful ear is "Cuando Digo Que No", a song in the typical style of the artist, however all around deciphered and with a decent instrumental execution behind an elucidation that helps us to remember the huge Camilo of his first years of solo vocation. It is likewise important to cite that "Mientras Mi Alma Sienta", Free and libertine adaptation of the proverb of the extravagant writer Albinoni and a standout amongst other known bits of established music ever. Camilo tries to put letter and voice to a prominently instrumental piece, acquiring an epic pen and an absence of thought with the great one of Wear Tomaso Albinoni, that nothing terrible had done to him nor, we assume, to his predecessors.

Nasone

A nasone ("<a href="plural">plural</a>" nasoni), also called a fontanella ("plural" fontanelle, lit. "little fountains"), is a type of <a href="drinking%20fountain">drinking fountain</a> found in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Literally meaning "large nose", they got their name from their characteristic design first introduced in the 1870s. There are approximately 2,500–2,800 nasoni in Rome, supplying the citizens and tourists with free drinking water.

Design.
Most nasoni share a design in the shape of a column. The form of the water spout varies but most nasoni have a metal spout protruding at mid-height which looks like a nose and gives the fountains their name "large noses". Other designs include wolf-heads, dragons and lions. Most are made of simple stone, although in the 1920s and 1930s nasoni were made of <a href="Travertine">travertine marble</a>, some of which remain today, mostly in parks and the <a href="Foro%20Italico">Foro Italico</a> area.

The water coming from the nasoni is the same supplied to the city's households and thus safe for drinking. It is continuously running from the fountain through a hole at the bottom of the spout and then recycled if not used. Additionally, most nasoni have a hole located at the top of the spout, allowing thirsty citizens to drink from the fountain more easily by blocking the bottom hole and forcing the water upwards.

History.
The city of Rome began installing nasoni in the 1870s to provide a water supply for the citizens. The exact year is not clear, with sources both mentioning 1872 and 1874 as the first time a nasone was installed. Most such fountains were created in the same design for decades. At its peak, approximately 5,000 nasoni existed in Rome. While their number dwindled in later years when domestic connections became more commonplace, there are still approximately 2,500 to 2,800 nasoni in all of Rome today, one tenth of them in the historical center. 

In addition, <a href="Acea%20%28company%29">Acea</a>, the company responsible for maintaining the city's water supply, has also installed ten "casa dell'acqua" (lit. "house of the water") kiosks in 2015. Described as "hi-tech nasoni", these provide free tap and sparkling water as well as information for tourists and a place to recharge mobile devices.

Benefits.
Apart from social reasons, supplying citizens, especially those without their own access, with drinkable water, nasoni are required because of the specifics of the Roman water supply system. This system requires ventilation valves which are provided by the nasoni. In addition, the constantly flowing water is used to keep the water in the pipes from stagnating, which is the main reason for bacterial proliferation. While this has been criticized by some as a waste of drinking water, only 1% of the water is lost due to nasoni, compared with nearly 50% due to old and leaky pipes. According to estimates, operating a nasone costs the city of Rome approximately 3–5 Euro per day, depending on the strength of the water flow.

Shut-offs.
In July 2017 <a href="Acea%20%28company%29">Acea</a>, Rome's water company, started shutting off some nasoni because drought has diminished the nearby <a href="Lake%20Bracciano">Lake Bracciano</a>, the city's main water reserve. The move was criticized by many, citing concerns that the decision will be hurtful to Rome's homeless population and animals, both of which rely on fresh water from these fountains.

Andrey P. Pashkevich

Andrey P. Pashkevich - Андрей Петрович Пашкевич - born in Moscow March 22, 1945 - died in Moscow February 21, 2011 - is a Russian cinematographer, film director & producer, and painter.
Name: Andrey P. Pashkevich

Born: March 22, 1945, Moscow (USSR)

Died: February 21, 2011 (65 y.), Moscow (Russian Federation)

Nationality: Russian

Known for: politically inspired paintings “Politecology” and abstract paintings.

Education: All Russian Institute of Cinematography named after S. Gerasimov (VGIK) , Moscow

Website: http://www.politecology.ru

Biography and artistic career.
Andrey P. Pashkevich was born in 1945 in the family of an art director, Petr I. Pashkevich, working at the film studios named after M. Gorky and professor at the Faculty of Art at the All Russian Institute of Cinematography named after S. Gerasimov, where Andrey Pashkevich finished his studies and obtained his diploma as cameraman and cinematographer.

As a Director of Photography he took part in the shooting of several feature films, amongst which some very well-known and still popular films such as “I still love, I still hope” («Еще люблю, еще надеюсь») and “We lived in the neighbourhood” («Мы жили по соседству») and also a number of documentary films such as “My friend, Otar Ioseliani” («Мой друг, Отар Иоселиани»).

In the 1990’ies Pashkevich created his own TV company “The Russian Musical Television” (RMTV) which produced musical programmes and series for Russian TV-channels.

At the same time he was actively painting.

The culminating point of the artistic heritage of Andrey Pashkevich is a series of paintings which the author himself called “Politecology” and which he has created during the period of Gorbachev’s perestroika and the formation of the new Russia. It reflects the political and social turmoil that shook up the life of people in Russia. Love for his country and compassion for its people is an outstanding feature of Pashkevich’s art. His “Politecology” has a purifying meaning. It is a tale about the suffering and bitter moments of Russian history that contains a warning and at the same time may be considered as a futuristic prophecy, a healing elixir and a very specific kind of catharsis.

Apart from the creations of these symbolic and very thoroughly thought over paintings about life influenced by political events, the painter also created abstract works, which are highly appreciated by art critics.

Andrey Pashkevich was a member of the International Federation of Artists (IFA).

The works of the artist are to be found in private collections, amongst which the collections of George Bush the Elder, the Richard Nixon Library in the USA, and countries such as France, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Finland, South Korea.

Erna von Abendroth

Erna von Abendroth (4 February 1887 - 26 February 1959) was a pioneering <a href="Germany">German</a> nurse and trainer/teacher. After the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> she became the first German nurse to receive a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">PhD degree</a> in return for a dissertation with a nursing theme. After the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, starting in May 1946 she took charge of the reconstruction of the at <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a>.

Life.
Erna von Abendroth was born in <a href="Ostritz">Ostritz</a>, a small town located to the south of Görlitz and directly on the frontier with <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>. Alexander Bernhard Ernst von Abendroth (1853-), her father, was a cavalry officer. She attended school locally and then spent five years studying at a teacher training college in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>. She concluded her studies, passing the necessary exams, in 1906. she then worked as a home tutor. In 1910 she completed a nursing training with the <a href="German%20Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> at the Carola Hospital in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>. During the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, which broke out in July 1914, she served as a volunteer nurse, and in 1916 passed the exams needed to become a fully qualified nurse. This did not put an end to her studies, however.

War ended in 1918 and she took on the care of her parents. She also took time to attend lectures at the <a href="TU%20Dresden">Dresden "Technical" Academy</a> and at <a href="Leipzig%20University">Leipzig University</a>. In 1921 she was awarded a doctorate for a dissertation on "the nursing profession with a particular focus on he context in Saxony" (""Der Beruf der Krankenpflegerin mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der sächsischen Verhältnisse""). Rather than embarking on an academic life, however, she persisted with her nursing career. She was a co-founder of the "Dresden City Sisterhood" during 1922/23, becoming matron of this Red Cross sponsored organisation in 1923. In 1924 she called for the creation of a permanent "Saxony Matrons' Conference" to provide advice on health care administration and nursing.

Between 1927 and 1929 she held the appointment of chair of the "[Matrons'] Sisterhood" in Dresden, which made her an influential voice in establishing the nursing academy there. In Dresden von Abendroth was involved in the education of many cohorts of nurses who later would remember her with great affection. The hospital and nursing academy were closed down in 1932, however, as the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> continued to take its toll of public services. Erna von Abendroth now left <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> and embarked on the first of several lengthy lecture and study tours abroad. Her travels included <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">United States of America</a>.

There was a <a href="Machtergreifung">change of government</a> in January 1933. The authorities now lost no time in <a href="Gleichschaltung">transforming Germany</a> into a <a href="Nazi%20Party">one-party</a> <a href="Enabling%20Act%20of%201933">dictatorship</a>. Through a combination of deficit financing and the pendulum of the economic cycle, it became possible to re-open the hospital and nursing academy in 1934. In keeping with the spirit of the times, the institution now had an uplifting new name. The "Rudolf Hess Hospital" became home to the "Brown sisters" - nurses committed to the <a href="National%20Socialist">Nazi</a> ideas. Headship of the newly reopened nursing academy went to Amalie Rau, a committed party supporter. There is no suggestion that Erna von Abendroth was either a Communist nor Jewish, but nor was she an admirer, far less a member, of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>. To work as a nurse in Nazi Germany seems to have required, formally or informally, membership of the "National Socialist sisterhood" (""NS-Schwesternschaft""). It appears to have been the pressures of <a href="Second%20World%20War">war</a>, which returned in the summer of 1939, that drew von Abendroth back to public sector nursing two years later.

In 1941 she joined the <a href="German%20Red%20Cross">German Red Cross</a> and its "Sisterhood for Abroad" (""Schwesternschaft für Übersee"") which was headquartered in Berlin. She worked as a red cross matron in various locations including <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle</a>, <a href="Essen">Essen</a>, <a href="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a>, <a href="Metz">Metz</a> and <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>. It was in Strasbourg that she was captured by the <a href="US%20army">Americans</a> early in 1945, becoming briefly a prisoner of war. After she was released she was working as a nurse in the <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> quarter of <a href="Radebeul">Radebeul</a> where she had found a refuge of sorts during the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Dresden%20in%20World%20War%20II">devastating air attacks</a> of February and March on the city centre.

In May 1946 Erna von Abenroth took over the leadership of the which was now reconstructed at the organisation's site in <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a>, replacing an equivalnet institution in Berlin that had been destroyed in the war. She worked at the academy in <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a> till her retirement in 1951.

The nursing academy in Dresden that she had established back in the 1920s came under the control of the <a href="Free%20German%20Trade%20Union%20Federation">Trades Union Federation</a> [nursing] sisterhood established in the <a href="Soviet%20occupation%20zone">Soviet occupation zone</a> in 1947. It served as a training school for senior nurses and, after 1951 (by which time the Soviet occupation zone had been relaunched as the <a href="German%20Democratic%20Republic">German Democratic Republic</a>) as a nursing academy for medical students.

Barone Fortress

The Barone Fortress in <a href="%C5%A0ibenik">Šibenik</a> (formerly known as "Šubićevac Fortress", <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a>: "Tvrđava Barone") is an <a href="early%20Modern">early Modern</a> fortress constructed in <a href="1646">1646</a> on Vidakuša hill above the city. Together with the remaining three city fortresses, it is a part of the Šibenik fortification system. It played a significant role in city's defense from the <a href="Ottomans">Ottomans</a> during the War of Crete. For a long time, it carried the name of its main defender, Baron Christoph von Degenfeld. At the start of 20th century, along with the surrounding neighborhood, it was renamed Šubićevac, after the Medieval patrician family <a href="%C5%A0ubi%C4%87">Šubić</a>.

The War of Crete and the Construction of Barone Fortress.
Since at least the mid-16th century, the city rectors and envoys had been stressing the need for the construction of fortification objects on the hills north of the city, because the city walls and St. Michael’s Fortress had not been built to endure any prolonged artillery attack. The pleas were constantly rejected by the <a href="Venetian%20Senate">Venetian Senate</a> due to lack of funds. In the spring of 1646, one year after the War of Crete had broken out between the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetians</a> and the Ottomans, the Bosnian pasha began to amass a large army for the attack on <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>. At the same time, a German nobleman in Venetian service, Baron Christoph Martin von Degenfeld took over the defense of the city, and a <a href="Genovese">Genovese</a> military engineer fr. Antonio Leni, arrived into Šibenik and made the sketches for the necessary improvement of the city’s defense. When the people of Šibenik renewed their request for protection, the Venetians denied them the funds once again, but the citizens were not explicitly forbidden from building the fortification by themselves. Upon hearing that, they took the matter into their own hands – the construction of both Barone Fortress and the adjacent St. John's Fortress began on August 1st 1646, and both fortresses were successfully built in only fifty-eight days. The first Ottoman siege in October 1646 was fended off after only seven days. The fortresses were strengthened over the following winter and were prepared for the next attack. On 17 August 1647, the Ottoman commander Techieli-pasha arrived in Šibenik with the largest invading army in Dalmatia since the Roman era – 25,000 soldiers and heavy artillery. After a ferocious one-month siege, the enemy withdrew with great losses both in manpower and equipment.

Architecture.
Originally, Barone Fortress looked somewhat differently than it does today, as it was probably hurriedly built in the <a href="dry-stone">dry-stone</a> technique. Thirteen years later, in 1659, the Venetian <a href="provveditore">provveditore</a> Antonio Bernardo initialized the construction work that transformed the fortress into an object measuring up to the standards of contemporary military architecture. Shaped as an irregular star, the fortress resisted enemy cannons thanks to the <a href="bastions">bastions</a> reinforced with mounds. The northern part of the fortress (<a href="hornwork">hornwork</a>) has two demi-bastions connected by a <a href="curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain wall</a>. That was the position of the defense artillery. The southern part was used for barracks and magazines. After the Ottoman threat had passed, the fortress was maintained poorly, and the original objects have decayed or been torn down with time. In the early-20th century, the City of Šibenik purchased and then renamed the fortress and its surrounding area.

Revitalization Project.
Barone Fortress was revitalized through an EU-funded project worth €1.38 million, and re-opened in January 2016. Like the renovated St. Michael’s Fortress in 2014, Barone Fortress also won the national Cultural Attraction of the Year Award in 2016. It now offers its visitors a digital tour through Šibenik’s past, via an <a href="augmented%20reality">augmented reality</a> platform and other multimedia features.
