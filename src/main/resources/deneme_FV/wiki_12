Japanese bamboo weaving

History.
More than six hundred species of bamboo grow in Japan, including the "<a href="Phyllostachys%20bambusoides">Phyllostachys bambusoides</a>" variety, which can grow to a height of 15–22 m and a diameter of 10–15 cm. Although defined as a subfamily of grasses, bamboo is characterized by its woody <a href="culm">culm</a> and a root system that can form either thick, slowly spreading clusters or more aggressive runners. 

Bamboo is a common theme in <a href="Japanese%20literature">Japanese literature</a> and a favoured subject of painters. Along with the evergreen pine and plum, which is the first flower of spring, bamboo is a part of the traditional <a href="Three%20Friends%20of%20Winter">Three Friends of Winter</a>. The three are a symbol of steadfastness, perseverance, and resilience. Japanese artists have often represented bamboo enduring inclement weather, such as rain or snow, reflecting its reputation for being flexible but unbreakable, and its association with steadfastness and loyalty.

Flower baskets for "<a href="ikebana">ikebana</a>" and other types were imported from China or their style copied. These "karamono" had formal, symmetrical structures with tightly plaited weaves. It was the 16th century tea master <a href="Sen%20no%20Riky%C5%AB">Sen no Rikyū</a> (1522-1591) who advocated for a simple, austere "<a href="wabi-cha">wabi-cha</a>" tea style with natural and "spontaneous" or seemingly artless utensils. These tea utensils established a Japanese bamboo art distinct from the imported Chinese style. Baskets were developed to look in a natural, asymmetric style, called "wamono". Around 1700 the embrace of the steeped "<a href="sencha">sencha</a>" tea ceremony coincided with a renewed admiration for <a href="Chinese%20culture">Chinese culture</a>, <a href="Chinese%20literature">literature</a>, and <a href="Chinese%20painting">painting</a> among the Japanese <a href="literati">literati</a>, a phenomenon that continued into the 19th century. Finely <a href="plait">plait</a>ed, elegant baskets imported from China served as models for Chinese-style ("karamono") baskets now created by Japanese craftsmen, following a tradition established during the <a href="Muromachi%20period">Muromachi period</a> (1392-1573). Recognition of bamboo craftsmanship as a traditional Japanese decorative art began in the end of the 19th century, and became accepted as an art form. 

Most of the master artisans designated Living National Treasures are selected from among participants in the annual Japanese Traditional Art Crafts Exhibitions. Whereas the annual Japan Art Academy exhibitions ("Nitten") emphasize artistic expression, the traditional Art Crafts Exhibitions prioritize the preservation of traditional skills and typically feature functional, though modern, baskets. In the postwar era, many of the leading bamboo artists were linked to established lineages. Although most artists are men, a number of female artists have emerged recently, such as Oki Toshie and Isohi Setsuko.

Bamboo art of recent decades reflects a greater diversity in technique and vision, though the same respect for tradition, terroir, and lineage that characterizes the history of the medium is still manifest in many ways. Notable artists have come to the craft from outside the traditional family lines, and many of them work independently. Some have a background in the fine arts, while others found themselves attracted to the ancient practice after having worked in an unrelated field.

As is similar in other Japanese crafts, the acquisition of knowledge usually involved a lengthy apprenticeship with the master of the workshop, often the father of the young disciple, in a system called "shitei "(師弟). Learning the basic skills and techniques generally takes five to ten years, but mastering them and developing an individual style can require decades. Hard work was required from the pupil almost every day in exchange for little or no pay. Living in the master's household and participating in household duties, apprentices carefully observed the master, senior students, and workshop before beginning any actual training. Even in the later stages of an apprenticeship it was common for a disciple to learn only through conscientious observation. While some works can be completed in several weeks, others take many months, and exhibition pieces often require longer, sometimes a year or two. Bamboo arts have a low profile compared to ceramics, mainly because of comparatively low number of artisans, and the amount of time it takes to finish an object.

Bamboo basketry is often complemented with other materials such as <a href="rattan">rattan</a> or <a href="hemp%20palm">hemp palm</a>. Basketry of only these materials also exist. Another is "tsuruzaiku" (つる細工), the craft of <a href="vine">vine</a> weaving, which is popular in many parts of the northern <a href="T%C5%8Dhoku%20region">Tōhoku region</a> where bamboo is more scarce, specifically the weaving of "<a href="akebia%20quinata">akebia quinata</a>" called "akebizaiku" (アケビ細工). 

The three main production areas of bamboo weaving were the western <a href="Kansai%20region">Kansai region</a> around the cities of Osaka and Kyoto, the eastern <a href="Kant%C5%8D%20region">Kantō region</a> around Tokyo, and the southernmost island of <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>. Each had their own <a href="plait">plait</a>ing techniques and styles. 

Kansai artisans.
Sophisticated "sencha" flower baskets and <a href="Japanese%20tea%20ceremony%20utensils">tea ceremony utensils</a> baskets were in especially high demand the area of western region of Kansai with Osaka and Kyoto at its center. In the late 19th century, master craftsmen in the region began combining technical perfection with artistic individuality to produce functional, signed "art baskets".

The pioneering Kansai bamboo artist <a href="Hayakawa%20Sh%C5%8Dk%C5%8Dsai">Hayakawa Shōkōsai</a> I (1815-1897), believed to be the first master to sign his baskets, studied the traditional craft of <a href="rattan">rattan</a> plaiting and concentrated on "sencha" tea ceremony utensils. His eldest son, Shōkōsai II (1860-1905), followed him into the basketry trade but died at an early age. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Shōkōsai III (1864-1922), who developed an advanced style of plaiting called "coarse weave", a departure from the family's signature techniques. After World War II, Shōkōsai IV (1902-1975) moved from Osaka to Kyoto, where he established the new family workshop. Shōkōsai V (1932-2011) explored further possibilities in armor plaiting, a type of parallel construction considered one of the traditional Hayakawa techniques. He exhibited his work at the annual Japanese Traditional Art Crafts Exhibitions beginning in 1966 and in 2003 was designated a <a href="Living%20National%20Treasure%20%28Japan%29">Living National Treasure</a> in 1953.

The Osaka-based bamboo artist <a href="Wada%20Waichisai">Wada Waichisai</a> I (1851-1901) established an important and long-lasting lineage of masters. He was known for his precise, delicate plaiting techniques, making primarily Chinese-style ("karamono") baskets and utensils for the "sencha" tea ceremony. 

Among his numerous disciples was <a href="Tanabe%20Chikuunsai">Tanabe Chikuunsai</a> I (1877-1937), who both perpetuated inherited traditions and began to modernize them. He developed the so-called "ryūrikyō" style of basketry after studying the 18th century paintings of <a href="Yanagisawa%20Kien">Yanagisawa Kien</a>, who often depicted bamboo baskets filled with flowers or fruits in the "bunjin" literati style. Chikuunsai made "ryūrikyō" baskets explicitly for exhibition, a trend that marked a significant shift in Japanese bamboo art, reflecting the ambition of master craftsmen to achieve the same degree of recognition already accorded contemporary <a href="Japanese%20pottery%20and%20porcelain">ceramic</a> and lacquer artists. Tanabe Chikuunsai II (1910-2000) and Chikuunsai III (1940-2014) extended the Tanabe lineage, with the latter producing unique geometric sculptures. The <a href="Sakai">Sakai</a>-based Tanabe Chikuunsai IV (b. 1973) has carried on the family tradition while also experimenting with monumental sculpture and organic installation works, such as at the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20Guimet">Musée Guimet</a> in 2016 or "The Gate" in 2017 at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>.

<a href="Maeda%20Chikub%C5%8Dsai">Maeda Chikubōsai</a> I (1872-1950), also from Sakai, established his own distinguished family line. He began his career producing "karamono" and literati baskets but then developed a unique method of using natural bamboo branches and roots to achieve a more rustic effect. He also made several pieces for the imperial court. Chikubōsai II (1917-2003) produced both "sencha" baskets and modern vessels made from round strips of bent-and-gathered bamboo. Beginning in the Taisho period, both Tanabe Chikuunsai I and Maeda Chikubosai I incorporated antique arrows into their work, which was particularly appreciated by clients who descended from "<a href="samurai">samurai</a>".

One of the artists who was influenced by Tanabe Chizuunsai II is Sugita Jozan (b. 1932 in Osaka).

Kantō artisans.
Japanese bamboo art in the eastern region of Kantō around Tokyo underwent a process of modernization during the first half of the 20th century. Several masters rose to fame through their participation in newly reorganized domestic art international exhibitions and began producing "art baskets". 

<a href="Iizuka">Iizuka</a> Hōsai II (1872-1934) and his brother Iizuka Rōkansai (1890-1958) spearheaded the movement, pioneering new directions for the field and elevating bamboo craft to an art form. Emphasizing artistic freedom and individuality, Rōkansai experimented with the possibilities of the medium and developed several new techniques, including bundled plaiting ("tabane-ami") and embroidered plaiting ("take sashi-ami"). <a href="Iizuka%20Sh%C5%8Dkansai">Iizuka Shōkansai</a> (1919-2004), who trained under his father, the famous Rōkansai, regularly exhibited his works at the prestigious annual <a href="Japan%20Art%20Academy">Japan Art Academy</a> exhibitions ("Nitten") and Japanese Traditional Art Crafts Exhibitions, and was designated a Living National Treasure in 1982. The Iizuka family traditions were transmitted to Katsushiro Sōhō (b. 1934) and Fujinuma Noboru (b. 1945), both Living National Treasures active in Tochigi Prefecture. 

Ishikawa Shōun (1895–1973) was a disciple of Iizuka Rōkansai, as well as Yokota Hōsai (1899-1975). Suzuki Kyokushōsai I (ca. 1872–1936) might have been connected to the Hōsai linneage.

Another important Kantō lineage is that of Honma Kazuaki (b. 1930), based in Niigata Prefecture, who specializes in bent bamboo works and has won renown for his large-scale abstract compositions. Honma Hideaki (b. 1959), working on Sado Island off the coast of Niigata Prefecture, employs a flexible local variety of bamboo in works inspired by the island's flora and fauna. 

Kyūshū artisans.
With a warm southern climate ideal for bamboo cultivation, the island of Kyūshū is the site of more than half of Japan's bamboo production. In the
early 20th century, the town of <a href="Beppu">Beppu</a> in Oita Prefecture, famous for its <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a>s, became a noted center of bamboo crafts; functional baskets and bamboo carvings from the area were widely exhibited. The <a href="Oita%20Prefectural%20Bamboo%20Craft%20and%20Technical%20Training%20Support%20Center">Oita Prefectural Bamboo Craft and Technical Training Support Center</a>, a publicly funded institution dedicated to bamboo craft, was established in 1938.

The artist Shōnō Shōunsai (1904-1974) attracted numerous disciples over the course of his long career. His abstract bamboo sculptures of the 1950s and 1960s were considered revolutionary. In 1967 he became the first bamboo artist honored with the title Living National Treasure. Shōnō Tokuzō (b. 1942), his son and heir to the family tradition, typically uses leached bamboo split into wide strips and combines parallel construction with plaiting to achieve a textural, multilayered effect.

Other prominent Kyūshū-based artists include Kadota Nikō (1907-1994), who applied characteristic Kyūshū techniques, and Honda Shōryū (b. 1951), one of his pupils, who makes undulating, complex sculptures with light, openwork textiles. Kibe Seihō (b. 1951), one of Shōryū's students, prefers functional vessels and employs classical plaiting techniques. Other artists such as Uematsu Chikuyū (b. 1947) and Shiotsuki Juran (b. 1948) create unique sculptures.

Techniques.
A number of plaiting techniques developed throughout time and in different regions: 

Bamboo weaving in art.
A number of art works such as paintings and pottery have taken up the theme of bamboo weaving. 

A design on a <a href="Nabeshima%20ware">Nabeshima ware</a> porcelain dish from the late 17th century depicts falling <a href="cherry%20blossom">cherry blossom</a>s in plaided baskets on a stream. The exact meaning of what the artists and owners were trying to convey is not conclusive, but the intention was to celebrate traditional Japanese aesthetics. The falling cherry blossoms in this design most likely commemorated the association between the flower and culture, symbolised by the baskets holding them.

In the "<a href="kakemono">kakemono</a>" hanging scroll called "Autumn Flowers in a Bamboo Basket", the "<a href="Nanga%20%28Japanese%20painting%29">Nanga</a>" artist <a href="Yosa%20Buson">Yosa Buson</a> (1716-1783) painted an bouquet of autumn flowers standing in a tall Chinese-style bamboo basket with a rounded handle. The depicted flowers are <a href="chrysanthemum">chrysanthemum</a>s ("kiku"), <a href="Chinese%20bellflower">Chinese bellflower</a>s ("kikyō"), and <a href="rose%20mallow">rose mallow</a>s ("fuyō") and are in full bloom in autumn. They are all therefore associated in traditional Japanese poetry with this season. The artist used a technique called "sumi-nijimi", or "ink blurring", for rendering the flowers. Here he applied brushstrokes to the surface of <a href="ink%20wash">ink wash</a>es before they dried, creating a soft texturing effect. For the texture of the plaited bamboo basket he used short horizontal strokes in dark ink to contrast it with the evocative flowers. 

A "<a href="mizusashi">mizusashi</a>" tea ceremony water jar from the 2nd half of 18th-early 19th century <a href="Edo%20period">Edo period</a> is in the shape of a bamboo basket. Here the artisan went so far to realistically imitate the surface of the bamboo by stoneware with cream slip and brown glaze.

Vampiro (cocktail)

The Vampiro is a cold mixed cocktail that includes fruit juice, spices, fruit soda, fresh lime juice, and <a href="tequila">tequila</a>, a distilled alcoholic beverage that is popular in Mexico. The Vampiro "...has a fruity, lightly carbonated, and spicy taste to it." 

The Vampiro can be made with Mexican sangrita, a prepared drink mixer containing orange juice and chili peppers. Once recipe lists the ingredients as tequila, limes, Kosher salt, Squirt brand citrus-flavoured soda and Viuda de Sanchez, an orange juice-based Mexican <a href="sangrita">sangrita</a> beverage. Viuda de Sanchez is sold in Mexico and in areas of the southern US with large Latino populations. If Viuda de Sanchez is not available, good quality fresh-squeezed orange juice, lime juice and spicy <a href="pico%20de%20gallo">pico de gallo</a> seasoning can be used as a substitute. The Vampiro is popular in Mexico. Mexicans call the cocktail "Vampiro", which means "<a href="vampire">vampire</a>". because the Viuda de Sanchez juice mixer's red colour is reminiscent of blood.
Preparation.
Vampiros may be made in a tall glass or an old fashioned glass. Bartenders may first "rim" the glass with Kosher Salt, which is done by placing a layer of Kosher Salt on a chopping board, moistening the glass' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the Kosher Salt, so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim. The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila. The next stage is to add the flavouring elements. This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo). The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended. 

Variants.
Some bartending guides suggest adding a shot of <a href="tomato%20juice">tomato juice</a>, fresh-squeezed orange and lime juice, <a href="grenadine%20syrup">grenadine syrup</a>, hot pepper sauce and freshly-ground black pepper to the glass, and omitting the Mexican sangrita. As well, some guides suggest that the ingredients be shaken and strained, not stirred.

In 2017, David Hammond from the "Chicago Tribune" described a variant called the Doce Vampiro cocktail, which is served at La Sirena Clandestina in Chicago. The blood-red drink is a blend of "...pisco, tequila, lemon, pineapple, Ramazzotti amaro and chicha morada, a sweet, tart, nonalcoholic Peruvian drink made from purple corn". Hammond states that the "...pisco, pineapple and lemon, bright and acidic, are the high notes", with the "...tequila, bitter herbaceousness of the Ramazzotti and baking-spice qualities of the chicha morada" providing the "[b]ass notes".

Macure

Macure were a tribe that lived on the territory on the part of Montenegro which is today known as Šekular <a href="Bratono%C5%BEi%C4%87i">Bratonožići</a> and <a href="Rov%C4%8Dani">Rovci</a>. Like other non-Slavic tribes of Montenegro, they are either assimilated or expelled. Their ethnogenesis is unknown. Many scholars support Šufflays hypothesis about their Albanian origin. There is also a hypothesis that they are related to <a href="Masurians">Masurians</a>. Today, their name is preserved in Serbian legends and myths, while their name is sometimes used in Montenegro as derogative.

Origin.
<a href="Milan%20%C5%A0ufflay">Milan Šufflay</a> was the first to set the hypothesis that Macure were of Albanian origin, like Mataguži, Maine, Malonščići and <a href="Bukumiri">Bukumiri</a>. This hypothesis about Macure was accepted by many other authors, including Pantelić. Like all other non-Slavic tribes of Montenegro, Macure were also completely assimilated or expeled by Slavs. Macure became a derogative term in Montenegro, which is the case with names of other conquired and expelled tribes of Lužani, <a href="Bukumiri">Bukumiri</a>, Mataruge and others.

According to some theories, Macure were part of Slavic tribe <a href="Masurians">Masurians</a> which also gave a name to <a href="Masurian%20Lake%20District">Masurian Lakes</a>.

Legacy.
Macure are commemorated in Serbian legends and myths. According to Serbian legends, they were tall and strong people. The Serb legends say that they saw snow for the first time when they came to <a href="Sinjajevina">Sinjajevina</a> in Montenegro and made snowball to bring it back to show it to their friends which soon melt in their hands.

Morley Shih (; born 2 August 1950) is a Taiwanese lawyer and judge. He attended <a href="National%20Taiwan%20University">National Taiwan University</a> and began his legal career in 1976. Shih was appointed <a href="Ministry%20of%20Justice%20%28Taiwan%29">Minister of Justice</a> in 2005 and served until 2008.

Early life and education.
Shih was born in Chiayi on 2 August 1950, and graduated from <a href="National%20Taiwan%20University">National Taiwan University</a> in 1972, where he studied law alongside <a href="Ma%20Ying-jeou">Ma Ying-jeou</a>.

Legal career.
Prosecutor and judge.
Shih began his legal career at the Taichung District Prosecutors' Office in 1976. In 1982, he was named a judge of the Taichung District Court. After two years on the bench, Shih was appointed chief justice of the Taichung District Court. Upon stepping down from the Taichung District Court, Shih returned to the Taichung District Prosecutors' Office, where he served as chief prosecutor. Shih received the most votes in a January 2000 poll run by the Prosecutors' Reform Association. Subsequently, Minister of Justice <a href="Chen%20Ding-nan">Chen Ding-nan</a> named Shih chief prosecutor in Kaohsiung. The next year, Shih was tabbed to lead the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office. He remained in the position until 2004, when he was named Vice Minister of Justice under Chen in November.

It was widely speculated that Shih would be Chen's successor. Shih was then appointed in January 2005 by incoming premier <a href="Frank%20Hsieh">Frank Hsieh</a>, and took office on 1 February 2005 with the Hsieh cabinet. Shih retained his position after <a href="Su%20Tseng-chang">Su Tseng-chang</a> and later <a href="Chang%20Chun-hsiung">Chang Chun-hsiung</a> assumed the premiership.

<doc id="54882467" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54882467" title="St Peter's Church, Henfield">
St Peter's Church, Henfield

St Peter's Church is a <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> parish church in the large village of <a href="Henfield">Henfield</a>, <a href="West%20Sussex">West Sussex</a>. Placed on the site of an 8th century Saxon church also dedicated to <a href="Saint%20Peter">St Peter</a>, it was built in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, but was <a href="Victorian%20restoration">heavily restored</a> and partially rebuilt in the 19th century. <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> has <a href="Listed%20building">listed</a> it at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance.

History.
The ground of the parish of <a href="Henfield">Henfield</a> is mostly composed of <a href="Weald%20Clay">Weald clay</a>, but towards the centre of the parish are low ridges of plateau gravel lying on <a href="Lower%20Greensand%20Group">Lower Greensand</a>. On one of these, near the old road that ran from Eatons, near <a href="Ashurst%2C%20West%20Sussex">Ashurst</a>, to <a href="Hurstpierpoint">Hurstpierpoint</a>, stands the church of St Peter, rather to the north-west of most of the village’s older buildings. The first St. Peter's Church, probably built on the same spot, was founded by <a href="thegn">thegn</a> Waerbald and his wife Tidburg, to whom <a href="Osmund%20of%20Sussex">Osmund, king of Sussex</a>, granted 15 <a href="Hide%20%28unit%29">hides</a> of land for that purpose in the year 770. It has been suggested that this church was a <a href="Minster%20%28church%29">minster</a>, i.e. that it held a community of clergymen, but this remains a disputed point. The 15 hides granted by Osmund can presumably be identified with the lands which appear after the Conquest as Stretham (or Henfield) manor, Oreham manor, Henfield park, and the rectory estate. The early history of Stretham manor, consisting of the church itself and most of the southern and central parts of Henfield parish along with outlying parts in neighbouring parishes, shows the close connection between St Peter's, Henfield and its bishops. By 1066 Stretham manor was the property of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">bishopric of Selsey</a>, and in 1086 <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> records it as belonging to the bishopric of Chichester (to which the see had been moved in 1075). The bishops of Chichester kept a house on this estate which in the later middle ages served as Henfield's main courthouse. A farmhouse comprising one wing of the original house still survives under the name Stretham Manor. A vicarage was ordained in 1219, by which date the rectory had become a <a href="Prebendary">prebend</a> of <a href="Chichester%20Cathedral">Chichester Cathedral</a>, further strengthening the links between St Peter's and its see.

The Saxon church survived at least as late as Domesday Book, but nothing now remains of it. Perhaps around 1200-1220, and certainly no later than 1250, it had been replaced by a simple <a href="nave">nave</a> and <a href="chancel">chancel</a> built of <a href="Caen%20stone">Caen stone</a>, a kind of <a href="Middle%20Jurassic">Middle Jurassic</a> limestone quarried in Normandy. The chancel arch from this building can still be seen, as can two <a href="lancet%20window">lancet window</a>s in what is now the <a href="vestry">vestry</a>. Two aisles to north and south were built later in the 13th century, and in the 14th century the porch and the arches separating the nave from the aisles were added. There was much further building in the 15th century: the tower, a westward extension of the nave, and north of the chancel a new chapel, known as the Parham chapel. This last may have been the work of <a href="Thomas%20Beckington">Thomas Beckington</a>, Prebendary of Henfield from 1438 to 1443. In 1530 the dedication of the church, which is usually given as being to <a href="Saint%20Peter">St Peter</a>, was recorded as being to Sts Peter and <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a>. In 1627 two dormer windows were added to the north aisle; those in the south aisle are of uncertain date but may be from the same period. A gallery on the south side of the church is recorded as being in place in 1718.

St Peter's and one of its <a href="churchwarden">churchwarden</a>s featured in a court case in 1607 involving the theft of a bell from <a href="St%20Leonard%27s%20Church%2C%20Aldrington">St Leonard's Church, Aldrington</a>, a parish church a few miles away. <a href="Aldrington">Aldrington</a> parish was then depopulated and the church was ruinous, and arrangements were made to sell its bell. Although this arrived at St Peter's, "it did not travel to Henfield with the consent of the Aldrington parishioners": the churchwarden admitted helping to steal it, and "the authorities at Henfield Church admitted that they had received of bell material" which was used to cast a new bell for the tower. They agreed to pay compensation of <a href="%C2%A3sd">£</a>16.5s. to Aldrington parish.

The 19th century saw extensive rebuilding of the fabric of the church. First of all the south aisle, which had been said to be badly out of repair as early as 1637, was replaced before 1833 at the expense of the notable botanist <a href="William%20Borrer">William Borrer</a>, a local resident, and a gallery was included for the use of schoolchildren. In 1855 the tower was restored by an unknown architect. In 1870 and 1871 a large-scale restoration was undertaken to the designs of the architects <a href="William%20Slater%20%28architect%29">William Slater</a> and <a href="Richard%20Carpenter%20%28architect%29">Richard Carpenter</a>. Most of the walls were refaced with flint, the chancel was lengthened eastward and raised in height, a new south chancel chapel was built, both aisles were entirely rebuilt, the roof of the nave was opened up and new clerestory lancet windows installed.

St Peter's Church was designated a Grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> on 15 March 1955. Such buildings are defined as being "particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest". In February 2001, it was one of 54 Grade II* listed buildings, and 1,028 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of <a href="Mid%20Sussex">Mid Sussex</a>. In 2008 a new stone floor was laid, under-floor heating installed, and the 19th-century pews were replaced with chairs.

Related buildings.
The prebend is recorded in 1341 as consisting of a house and garden with 60 acres of land. About 1520 it became the property of the diocese, but a few years later in 1533 it was leased for 80 years to Thomas Bishop, lawyer to Bishop <a href="Robert%20Sherborne">Robert Sherburne</a>. From him the lease passed first to his son <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Bishopp%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Thomas Bishop</a>, then to the second Thomas's younger son <a href="Henry%20Bishop%20%28postmaster%20general%29">Henry Bishop</a>, <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Postmaster General of England</a>, who was temporarily deprived of it during the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth period</a>. Parsonage House, the successor of the original prebend house, was built in the 16th century or earlier but was refronted in the 18th century; it still stands in Church Street.

A vicarage house appears in documents of 1481, 1529, 1636 and 1724, but the present vicarage was built c. 1806 and enlarged c. 1850.

In 1812 a church school for boys was opened in Henfield. Its successor, St Peter's Church of England Primary School, occupies buildings on the north-west edge of the village which were built in 1957 and extended in 1983. 

An <a href="Tin%20tabernacle">iron mission room</a> capable of seating 60 was built on Oreham Common in 1891, but, services there being very badly attended, it was demolished before 1909.

Architecture and fittings.
The church of St Peter as it stands today consists of a nave with north and south aisles and <a href="transept">transept</a>s, a chancel flanked by a chapel to the north and a vestry to the south, a porch and a tower. The nave dates from the 13th century, though whether early or late is disputed. The chancel arch, though 13th century, was rebuilt in the 19th. The aisles and chancel are products of the 1870-1871 restoration. The 15th-century Parham chapel is remarkable for its east window, a lovely example of the <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture">Gothic style</a> of Henry VI's reign. The tower is in a rather austere version of the Perpendicular style, "as grim", <a href="Pevsner%20Architectural%20Guides">Pevsner</a> says, "as it would be in <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>".

During the restoration work of 1870-1871 some <a href="mural">mural</a>s were uncovered, the most interesting of which, found on the church's north wall, was on a heraldic subject. Medieval murals are quite common in Sussex churches, but this one was dated as late as 1694. There was also formerly a painting of the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Decalogue</a>, <a href="Creed">Creed</a> and <a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a> with cherubs and angels, dating from 1897, which hung in the Parham chapel until the 1950s.

The church's notable fittings include an octagonal font, dated variously to the early 13th century or to the 15th century, a 14th-century iron-bound chest, and, in the Parham chapel, a <a href="reredos">reredos</a> carved by <a href="Frank%20Ernest%20Howard">Frank Ernest Howard</a> with figures of the patron saints of the four <a href="countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">countries of the United Kingdom</a>. The chapel screen, in the arch between the Parham chapel and the north aisle, was executed by Frances E. Allen in 1969, but it incorporates 15th-century work. There are eight 18th-century bells, said to give "one of the best rings in the county". The plate is of a similar date, consisting of a salver (1704), flagon (1732), chalice (1733), and two <a href="paten">paten</a>s and an almsdish (1753). The modern <a href="kneeler">kneeler</a>s illustrate in tapestry the animal and plant life of Henfield parish in almost 300 different designs.

There are two <a href="Monumental%20brass">brasses</a>. One, in the vestry, shows Ann Kenwellmersh (d. 1633) with her hand on the head of her nine-year-old grandson Menelab Rainsford (d. 1627). The other, in the Parham chapel, is of Thomas Bishop (d. 1559), the first of the family to lease the rectory. Also in the Parham chapel is a monument to Thomas's grandson Henry Bishop, the Postmaster General. Two memorial tablets inside the church, on the right as you walk through the door from the porch, name the 60 men of the parish who died in the First World War, and the 14 who died in the Second World War.

Stained glass.
St Peter's Church is notable for the quality of its stained glass, which includes work by some of the best-known designers in late 19th-century and early 20th-century England. In the north aisle the second window, depicting Fortitude and Charity, was produced c. 1907 by the firm of <a href="James%20Powell%20and%20Sons">James Powell and Sons</a>, and the first window (<a href="Luke%20the%20Evangelist">St Luke</a> and St Paul) was designed by the Sussex artist <a href="Charles%20Eamer%20Kempe">Charles Eamer Kempe</a> in 1903. The north transept's north window was made in 1928 by Kempe and Co after Kempe's death; its east window (<a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Madonna and Child</a>, and <a href="Saint%20Nicholas">St Nicholas</a> with children) by <a href="Frederick%20Charles%20Eden">Frederick Charles Eden</a>, a <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> man, in 1935. In the Parham chapel, the north window is full of local interest, its five lights depicting <a href="Lancelot%20Andrewes">Lancelot Andrewes</a>, St <a href="Richard%20of%20Chichester">Richard of Chichester</a>, St Peter (the dedicatee of the church), St <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a> (whom <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Gibbon</a> called the Apostle of Sussex), and St <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a>. It was produced by Kempe and Co in 1920. The chapel's east window, in four lights, is a 1921 work by Geoffrey Fuller Webb. It shows the Captain of the <a href="Heavenly%20host">Host of the Lord</a> appearing to <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a> before <a href="Jericho">Jericho</a> (<a href="Book%20of%20Joshua">Joshua</a> 5:13-15), and <a href="John%20of%20Patmos">St John the Divine</a> writing about the Holy City. Between the chapel and the chancel are glass windows engraved with agricultural scenes, which were installed in 1969. The five-light east window of the chancel was designed by Kempe in 1874 or 1875, and shows a Nativity scene, the Crucifixion, and several saints. In the vestry, which is kept locked, is a striking, quasi-<a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> depiction of <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> over the text "She hath done what she could" (<a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Mark</a> 14:8). It was produced by <a href="The%20Glass%20House%2C%20Fulham%23Lowndes%20and%20Drury">Lowndes and Drury</a>, with the design attributed by one authority to <a href="Mary%20Lowndes">Mary Lowndes</a>, by another to Isabel Lilian Gloag. According to the art historian Peter Cormack it was designed by Gloag and painted by Lowndes. An adjoining office, also locked, has the oldest stained glass in the church, a depiction of Jesus preaching the <a href="Sermon%20on%20the%20Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a> installed in 1872. Its style suggests it is the work of <a href="Clayton%20and%20Bell">Clayton and Bell</a>. The three-light south transept window (<a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">St Oswald</a>, <a href="Saint%20George">St George</a> and <a href="Edmund%20the%20Martyr">St Edmund</a>) is by Kempe and Co, 1916.

Siege of Chittorgarh, 1303

In 1303, the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> ruler <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a> captured the <a href="Chittor%20Fort">Chittor Fort</a> from the <a href="Guhilas%20of%20Medapata">Guhila</a> king <a href="Ratnasimha">Ratnasimha</a>, after an eight month long siege. The conflict has been described in several legendary accounts, including the historically unreliable "<a href="Padmavat">Padmavat</a>", which claims that Alauddin's motive was to obtain Ratnasimha's beautiful wife <a href="Rani%20Padmini">Padmini</a>.

Background.
The <a href="Mewar">Mewar</a> region in north-western India was ruled by the <a href="Guhilas%20of%20Medapata">Guhila dynasty</a>, whose seat was located at the <a href="Chittor%20Fort">Chittor Fort</a> ("Chittorgarh"). In 1299, Alauddin's general <a href="Ulugh%20Khan">Ulugh Khan</a> had raided the Mewar region on his way to <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji%27s%20conquest%20of%20Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. However, this appears to have been a light raid rather than a serious invasion, and the Guhila king Samarasimha protected his country from the raiders (possibly by paying a tribute).

In 1301, Alauddin <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji%27s%20conquest%20of%20Ranthambore">conquered Ranthambore</a>, which was located between Delhi and Chittor, and then returned to Delhi. The same year, <a href="Ratnasimha">Ratnasimha</a> ascended the throne of Chittor. The later legends based on <a href="Malik%20Mohammad%20Jaisi">Malik Mohammad Jaisi</a>'s epic poem "<a href="Padmavat">Padmavat</a>" state that Alauddin invaded Chittor to obtain Padmini, the queen of Ratnasimha (called Ratan Sen or Ratan Singh in these legends). According to these legends, a man named Raghava told Alauddin about the extraordinary beauty of Padmini. However, Padmini does not find a mention in the earliest records of Alauddin's conquest of Chittor, such as the chronicles by <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>, <a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Barani</a> and <a href="Isami%20%28historian%29">Isami</a>. Most modern historians have rejected the authenticity of the Padmini legend.

The siege.
On 28 January 1303, Alauddin started his march to Chittor with a large army. After arriving near the fort, he set up a camp between the <a href="Berach%20River">Berach</a> and Gambhiri rivers. His army then surrounded the fort from all the sides. Alauddin stationed himself at Chitori hillock located to the north of the fort.

The siege went on for nearly 8 months, which suggests that the defenders put up a strong resistance. <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>, who accompanied Alauddin to Chittor, has described the siege in brief, in his "Khaza'in ul-Futuh". However, no detailed account of the siege operations is available. Khusrau implies that the frontal attacks by the invaders failed twice. He states that during the two months of the rainy season, the defenders managed to reach the "waist" of the hill, but could not advance further. Alauddin ordered the fort to be pelted with stones from <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s ("munjaniqs"), while his armoured soldiers attacked it from all sides.

The fort garrison may have suffered from a famine or an epidemic. On 26 August 1303, Alauddin entered the fort. After his victory, Alauddin ordered a general massacre of Chittor's population. According to Amir Khusrau, 30,000 Hindus were "cut down like dry grass" as a result of this order.

Fate of Ratnasimha.
Accounts vary about what happened to <a href="Ratnasimha">Ratnasimha</a>, the ruler of Chittor. The early Muslim chroniclers such as <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>, <a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Ziauddin Barani</a> and <a href="Isami%20%28historian%29">Isami</a>, state that the unnamed ruler ("Rai") of Chittor surrendered to Alauddin, and was pardoned. The Jain writer Kakka Suri (1336) states that Alauddin took away his wealth, and "made him move like a monkey from one city to another". The "<a href="Padmavat">Padmavat</a>" legend claims that Ratnasimha ("Ratan Sen") died in a combat with the ruler of <a href="Kumbhalgarh">Kumbhalner</a>, before Alauddin's conquest of the fort. The 17th century chronicler <a href="Muhnot%20Nainsi">Muhnot Nainsi</a>, who wrote under Rajput patronage, states that Ratnasimha died on the battlefield.

The <a href="Kumbhalgarh">Kumbhalgarh</a> "<a href="prashasti">prashasti</a>" (eulogistic inscription) of 1460 CE, which is the earliest Hindu record of the siege, states that Ratnasimha "departed" from the battlefield, after which Lakshmasimha died defending the fort because only the cowards forsake "the established traditions of the family", while "those who are valorous and steady do not give up their pursuit." Modern historians have interpreted the word "departed" ("tasmin gate" in <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>) variously, either to mean that Ratnasimha died fighting on the battlefield, or to mean that he deserted the defenders and surrendered.

Jauhar.
The legendary poem "<a href="Padmavat">Padmavat</a>" states that Ratnasimha's queen <a href="Rani%20Padmini">Padmini</a> and other women committed suicide by "<a href="jauhar">jauhar</a>" (mass self-immolation) to avoid being captured by Alauddin. This claim is also repeated in several later texts. Historian <a href="Kishori%20Saran%20Lal">Kishori Saran Lal</a> dismisses the the "Padmavat" as a non-historical text, but believes that a "jauhar" did happen at Chittor following Alauddin's conquest. On the other hand, <a href="Banarsi%20Prasad%20Saksena">Banarsi Prasad Saksena</a> notes that Amir Khusrau does not mention any "jauhar" at Chittor, although he has referred to the "jauhar" during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Ranthambore%2C%201301">earlier conquest of Ranthambore</a>. Therefore, Saksena believes that the story of "jauhar" at Chittor is a fabrication of the later writers.

Aftermath.
Alauddin assigned Chittor to his son Khizr Khan (or Khidr Khan), who was 7 or 8 years old at the time. The Chittor fort was renamed "Khizrabad" after the prince. Khizr Khan was given a gold-embroidered robe and a red canopy, which was usually bestowed upon an <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>. Alauddin stayed at Chittor for 7 more days, and then left for Delhi, probably after learning about the <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20India%2C%201303">Mongol invasion</a>.

As Khizr Khan was only a child, the actual administration was handed over to a slave named Malik Shahin, who held the office of "naib-i barbek", and whom Alauddin called his son. According to the 14th century chronicler <a href="Isami%20%28historian%29">Isami</a>, Malik Shahin fled the fort sometime later, because he was afraid of the <a href="Vaghela%20dynasty">Vaghela</a> king <a href="Karna%20%28Vaghela%20dynasty%29">Karna</a>, who had managed to recapture the neighbouring Gujarat region after <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji%27s%20conquest%20of%20Gujarat">Alauddin's 1299 invasion</a>.

Later, Alauddin seems to have decided that it was best to govern Chittor indirectly through a Hindu ruler. He transferred the governance of Chittor from Khizr Khan to the <a href="Chahamanas%20of%20Jalor">Chahamana</a> chief Maladeva (Maldeo), who was supported by the locals. Maladeva was a brother of the <a href="Kanhadadeva">Kanhadadeva</a>, and had saved Alauddin's life from an accident during Alauddin's siege of Kanhadadeva's Jalore fort. He contributed 5,000 horsemen and 10,000 infantrymen to Alauddin's campaigns, whenever ordered. He used to bring gifts for Alauddin during his annual visit to the imperial court, where he was honoured in return. Alauddin maintained an imperial garrison at Chittor, and one of his inscriptions (dated May 1310) has been discovered there.

According to the 16th century chronicler Firishta, when Alauddin was at his deathbed, the ruler of Chittor rebelled, and executed the imperial soldiers stationed in the fort. After the death of Maladeva around 1321, the fort came under the control of <a href="Hammir%20Singh">Hammir Singh</a>, a ruler of the <a href="Sisodia">Sisodia</a> branch of the Guhilas.

However, historian <a href="Peter%20Jackson%20%28historian%29">Peter Jackson</a> believes that the fort remained under the control of the governors dispatched from Delhi, even during the reigns of the first two <a href="Tughluq%20dynasty">Tughluq</a> rulers (1321-1350). This is suggested by epigraphic evidence. The accounts about Maladeva and Sisodias originated from a Sanskrit epic, and seem to be inaccurate.

His main goal was to eliminate the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Samosata">Emirate of Samosata</a> as a commercial and military rival of the Edessene state. The expedition was carried out from 14 to 20 February, 1098.
Circumstances of the War.
Baldwin decided upon his ascension of co-regent of Edessa that <a href="Samosata">Samosata</a> would have to be eliminated in order for his new county to fully control the surrounding countryside and to establish unbroken communications with <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantium</a> in the west and the crusaders sieging <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> in the south.

The Conflict.
Despite the help of the Edessene militia, the expedition was not to turn out favorably for Baldwin. The Edessenes were poor, inexperienced soldiers, and the company was quickly caught in an ambush by the <a href="Turkish%20People">Turks</a> of Samosata, who slew around a thousand of them in the ensuing battle. Baldwin, however, did manage to capture and garrison the village of St. John, which was close to Balduk's capital. From this point, he was able to control the flow of the Turks in and out of the city, resulting in a decline in Turkish raids into the Edessene countryside.

The Rancher

The Rancher is a painting by <a href="Jaune%20Quick-to-See%20Smith">Jaune Quick-to-See Smith</a>. It is in the collection of the <a href="Hood%20Museum%20of%20Art">Hood Museum of Art</a> at <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a>. The painting serves as Quick-to-See Smith's tribute to <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, where she grew up. 

Description.
The painting is a tribute to where Quick-to-See Smith grew up: Montana. The painting, which is <a href="acrylic%20paint">acrylic paint</a> on <a href="canvas">canvas</a>, features Quick-to-See Smith's interpretation of <a href="George%20Catlin">George Catlin</a>'s painting, "Ee-he-a-duck-chee-a (He Who Ties His Hair Before)" in the middle of the painting, in black paint. Logos for <a href="Purina">Purina</a> and <a href="Krispy%20Kreme">Krispy Kreme</a> are depicted, as is the painted words "french fries." Next to "french fries" are two hands painted saying "french fries" in <a href="American%20Sign%20Language">American Sign Language</a>.

The painting is signed and inscribed on the back, top edge of the painting, using black marker. It reads: [illeg.] Smith 2002 "THE RANCHER" ACl 72" x 48"

Curatorial analysis.
In this work, Quick-to-See Smith seeks to reject <a href="stereotypes%20about%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20North%20America">stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America</a>, by using Caitlin's work. The use of the brand logos is believed assert "that Native peoples can be simultaneously traditional and contemporary," according to curators at the Hood Museum of Art. "Hecho en USA" is meant to reflect "the intermingling of languages, cultures, and subcultures of America." Additionally, the word "french fries" and the sign language are meant to depict how Native peoples often must incorporate new ideas and words into their lexicon and lives as they seek to remain connected to modern life. 

History.

Wanman people

The Wanman were an <a href="indigenous%20Australian">indigenous Australian</a> people of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>'s <a href="Pilbara">Pilbara</a> region.

Country.
The Wanman's territory ("waran") extended over some . Their southern boundary lay around the McKay Range and the area of <a href="Lake%20Disappointment">Lake Disappointment</a>. Westwards, it reached "Wadurara" on the <a href="Rudall%20River">Rudall River</a>. The northern frontier lay in the vicinity of <a href="Lake%20Dora%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Lake Dora/"Walerelere"</a>, "Mendidjildjil" and "Karbardi", while they were present eastwards as far as the "George, Wooloomber" and "Auld" lakes. The change to from their beloved <a href="Claypan">claypan lakes</a> country ("tjapipodari"] to mulga terrain in the south marked a limit beyond which they thought danger lay.

Ecology.
As often natural features can mark a kind of informal boundary between tribes. With the Wanman, that boundary in the south was delineated by the transition from their clumpy <a href="Triodia%20%28grass%29">porcupine grassland</a> to the thick <a href="Acacia%20aneura">mulga shrubland</a> of the <a href="Kartudjara">Kartudjara</a>. The onset of drought would push them northwest, to around "Karbardi" and "Pulburukuritji", and <a href="Rudall%20River">Kalamilji</a>. Their harsh almost treeless sandhill landscape was mostly devoid of larger game like emu and kangaroo, though the hare wallaby and opossum, if caught, would provide some meat. Its poor grassland constrained the Wanman to develop grass-milling in order to eke out food from seeds, one of the few Australian tribes, such as the <a href="Ualarai">Ualarai</a> and the <a href="Spinifex%20people">Pila Nguru</a>, who resorted to this technique A list of the primary foods was provided to <a href="Norman%20Tindale">Norman Tindale</a> by one tribesman:

<a href="Portulaca%20oleracea">Portulaca seeds</a>, once harvested, were worked in stone-rings
The "kitibaru" also served as a digging stick to forage for <a href="Southern%20marsupial%20mole">marsupial moles</a>. String spun from animals or hair, worn around the waist, was used to lasso lizards, and then hitch them to a string belt to bring back to the campsite.

Social organization.
The Wanman were probably divided into six <a href="Band%20society">hordes</a>, each with its own wells. Such estates gave exclusive wood-cutting rights to each member of the horde but Wanman from all clans had equal access to the major watering holes ("wongal") Drought would at times force them into <a href="Nyangumarta%20people">Nyangumarta</a> land where, in exchange for water, they would be constrained to hand over their women in marriage. The Nyangumarta themselves would often raid the Wanman in order to secure wives.

History of contact.
The extreme conditions of desert life pressed the Wanman to develop techniques to harvest food from grasses and this traditional knowledge served them well as they moved towards the coast, since they could quickly adapt their skills to glean <a href="Cenchrus%20ciliaris">buffel or afghan grass</a>, which had seeded into the landscape from imported camel saddles and was in demand as a fodder grass in arid zones.

Dish With One Spoon

The Dish With One Spoon, also known as the One Dish One Spoon, is a <a href="wampum">wampum</a> <a href="treaty">treaty</a> originally made between the <a href="Anishinaabe">Anishinaabe</a> and <a href="Iroquois">Haudenosaunee</a>, and covering territories in the <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20Lowlands">St. Lawrence lowlands</a> and <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Basin">Great Lakes Basin</a> of North America, including parts of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>.

Today, some see the treaty as a convenant that applies to all those living in <a href="Southern%20Ontario">Southern Ontario</a>, including Indigenous peoples not party to the original treaty, as well as settlers and newcomers. The Dish With One Spoon has been incorporated into many territorial acknowledgements for organizations and institutions in the <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> area, including the <a href="Council%20of%20Ontario%20Universities">Council of Ontario Universities</a> and ministries of the Toronto Conference of the United Church of Canada.

History of the treaty.
The Dish With One Spoon was a common metaphor and recurring phrase used in Indigenous diplomacy, particularly among Indigenous peoples of the Great Lakes region, although records indicate it also extended as far south as <a href="The%20Carolinas">The Carolinas</a>. The phrase was used to refer to the stewardship of shared territories and hunting grounds ("the dish") and the collective responsibility to ensure there was always enough game and fish to eat for all. Sometimes other terms, such as "bowl", were used in place of "dish."

Written records shown that the one-dish metaphor was used throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The use of the metaphor also predates the arrival of Euopeans as it was used by the <a href="Great%20Peacemaker">Great Peacemaker</a> in oral histories of the formation of the <a href="Iroquois%20confederacy">Iroquois Confederacy</a> and referenced in the <a href="Great%20Law%20of%20Peace">Great Law of Peace</a>.

According to <a href="Tuscarora%20people">Tuscarora</a> historian Rick Hill, the Dish With One Spoon is believed by some to be a <a href="Pre-Columbian%20era">pre-contact</a> agreement and the earliest known example of a North American treaty. Others trace the origins of the treaty to events occurring after the arrival of Europeans, notably the <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">fur trade</a>, and have linked the treaty with a series of peace negotiations that took place in the late 1600s during the <a href="Beaver%20Wars">Beaver Wars</a>.

History of the wampum.
The Dish With One Spoon treaty was recorded in one or possibly multiple wampum belts over the years.

During a treaty gathering in 1840, Six Nations wampum keeper John Skanawati Buck presented four wampum belts, including one which commemorated the Dish with One Spoon. The belt was kept at <a href="Six%20Nations%20of%20the%20Grand%20River">Six Nations of the Grand River</a> by John Skanawati Buck until his death in 1893, after which time the belts in his possession were dispersed, with some sold to traders and collectors. The belt was later recorded to be in possession of Evelyn H.C. Johnson who donated it to the <a href="Royal%20Ontario%20Museum">Royal Ontario Museum</a> in 1922. 

The belt currently resides at the Royal Ontario Museum. It is mostly made of white whelk shells with a small area of purple quahog clam shells in the centre of the belt representing the dish.

Alauddin Khilji's conquest of Malwa

In 1305, the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> ruler <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a> sent an army to capture the <a href="Paramara">Paramara</a> kingdom of <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a> in central India. The Delhi army defeated and killed the powerful Paramara minister Koka, while the Paramara king <a href="Mahalakadeva">Mahalakadeva</a> took shelter in the <a href="Mandu%2C%20Madhya%20Pradesh">Mandu</a> fort. Alauddin appointed Ayn al-Mulk Multani as the governor of Malwa. After consolidating his power in Malwa, Ayn al-Mulk besieged Mandu and killed Mahalakadeva.

Background.
The <a href="Paramara%20dynasty">Paramara dynasty</a> ruled the <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a> region in central India. By 1305, nearly all the Indian rulers to the north of Malwa had acknowledged Alauddin's suzerainty. The Paramara king <a href="Mahalakadeva">Mahalakadeva</a> was a weak ruler, and his prime minister ("pradhan") Koka was more powerful than him.

Koka's death.
In 1305, Alauddin sent a cavalry to capture Malwa. It is not clear who commanded this army, but he might have been Ayn al-Mulk Multani (or Ainul Mulk), whom Alauddin later appointed as the governor of Malwa. According to the Delhi chronicler <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>, the Delhi army comprised 10,000 soldiers, who had been selected specifically for the mission.

According to Khusrau, the Malwa army commanded by Koka comprised a 30,000-40,000 strong <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> and an "innumerable" <a href="infantry">infantry</a>. The later historians Yahya, Firishta, and Hajiuddabir state that the Malwa army comprised 40,000 cavalry and 100,000 infantry.

In the ensuing battle, the Delhi army emerged victorious. Khusrau states that the battlefield was "bloody with mud" as far as the human eye could see. Koka's horse was caught in a <a href="mire">mire</a>, and he was killed by arrows. His head was sent to Delhi, where it was trampled under the feet of horses at the palace gates.

Alauddin appointed Ayn al-Mulk as the governor of Malwa. Ayn al-Mulk raided the former Paramara capital <a href="Dhara">Dhara</a>, where he broke the <a href="Dhar%20iron%20pillar">Dhar iron pillar</a>. The former Paramara vassals were forced to recognize Alauddin's suzerainty. These included the chiefs of the <a href="Ujjain">Ujjain</a>, <a href="Dhar">Dhar</a>, and <a href="Chanderi">Chanderi</a> cities. Ayn al-Mulk sent a detailed record of his success to Delhi, where a week-long celebration was held and sweets were distributed among public for the entire week.

Mahalakadeva's death.
After the establishment of peaceful conditions in a large part of Malwa, Ayn al-Mulk marched to <a href="Mandu%2C%20Madhya%20Pradesh">Mandu</a>, where the Paramara king Mahalakadeva stayed. Mahalakadeva sent an army led by his son to fight the invaders. However, his son was killed on the battlefield, and his army was defeated. The Delhi army besieged Mandu, and managed to enter it, after one of Mahalakadeva's fort guards betrayed him. The guard told the invaders about a secret entrance to the fort. Using this passage, the Delhi army entered the Mandu fort at night, taking Mahalakadeva by surprise.

Mahalakadeva fled to a spring called Sar ("Chashm-i Sar" in the Delhi chronicles), where he was killed. The Delhi army captured the fort on 23 November 1305, and Alauddin assigned it to Ayn al-Mulk. An inscription from <a href="Udaipur%20%28Madhya%20Pradesh%29">Udaipur</a> indicates that the Paramara dynasty survived in the north-eastern part of Malwa in 1310. However, this area had also come under the Delhi Sultanate rule by the <a href="Tughluq%20dynasty">Tughluq</a> period in 1338.

A Journey to the Center of the Mind (book series)

A Journey to the Center of the Mind (JCM) is a book series authored by <a href="James%20R.%20Fitzgerald">James R. Fitzgerald</a>, retired <a href="FBI%20Agent">FBI agent,</a> <a href="criminal%20profiler">criminal profiler</a> and <a href="Forensic%20linguistics">forensic linguist</a>. The series, published by Infinity Publishing between 2014 and 2017, consists of three volumes detailing chronologically the life and career circumstances that led to Jim Fitzgerald's involvement in the FBI's <a href="UNABOM">UNABOM</a> investigation, which ultimately resulted in the arrest and prosecution of <a href="Ted%20Kaczynski">Theodore Kaczinski</a>, also known as the Unabomber.

JCM Book I: The Coming-of-Age Years (2014).
The first volume of the series is an account of Fitzgerald's early years, from childhood to his graduation from the Police Academy. The book describes various formative relationships and encounters with friends (including a future convicted killer), law breakers, and police—influences that set him on a path toward a long and successful career in <a href="law%20enforcement">law enforcement</a>.

JCM Book II: The Police Officer Years (2017).
The second book in the series recounts Fitzgerald's most significant experiences as a police officer in <a href="Bensalem%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania</a>, from his first night on patrol—a "trial by fire" that resulted in headlines—to his initiation into the politics of the legal system. JCM II chronicles the investigations, arrests, and prosecutions that led to Fitzgerald's promotion to sergeant and ultimately his recruitment to the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>.

JCM Book III: The (First Ten) FBI Years (2017).
The third volume resumes the story of Fitzgerald's progression in law enforcement, beginning with his time at the <a href="FBI%20Academy">FBI Academy</a> in <a href="Quantico%2C%20Virginia">Quantico, Virginia</a> before proceeding to his first assignment at the New York Field Division's highly-respected Joint Bank Robbery Task Force, where his participation in the arrests of <a href="Robbery">robbers</a>, <a href="Kidnapping">kidnappers</a>, <a href="Extortion">extortionists</a>, <a href="Murder">murderers</a>, and <a href="Pedophilia">pedophiles</a> eventually resulted in promotion to <a href="Criminal%20profiler">Criminal Profiler</a> at the National Center for the Investigation of Violent Crime, which would later give rise to the FBI's <a href="Behavioral%20Analysis%20Unit">Behavioral Analysis Unit</a> (BAU). The book concludes with the account of Fitzgerald's first assignment as a profiler with the UNABOM Task Force in <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco, California</a>, where his skills in <a href="forensic%20linguistics">forensic linguistics</a> were instrumental in the arrest and successful prosecution of the Unabomber, <a href="Ted%20Kaczynski">Theodore Kaczynski</a>, hence resolving what had been the most prolonged and expensive investigation in the history of the FBI.

Siege of Siwana

In 1308, the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> ruler <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a> captured the <a href="Siwana">Siwana</a> fort located in present-day <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, India. Sitala Deva, the ruler of the Siwana, tried to flee, but was captured and killed.

Background.
At the beginning of the 14th century, the present-day <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> had several small principalities centered around hill forts. Most of these principalities had acknowledged Alauddin's suzerainty after his conquest of the powerful <a href="Siege%20of%20Ranthambore%2C%201301">Ranthambore</a> (1301) and <a href="Siege%20of%20Chittorgarh%2C%201303">Chittor</a> (1303) kingdoms. However, the forts of <a href="Siwana">Siwana</a> and <a href="Jalore%20Fort">Jalore</a>, located in the south-west end of Rajasthan, remained independent. Siwana, located near the <a href="Thar%20Desert">Thar Desert</a>, was controlled by a <a href="Paramara%20dynasty%23Branches%20and%20claimed%20descendants">Paramara</a> chief named Sitala Deva (also called "Satal Deo" or "Sital Dev" in medieval chronicles). A number of local chiefs acknolwedged his suzerainty.

According to the Delhi courtier <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>'s "Dawal Rani", the Delhi army had been besieging the Siwana fort for 5-6 years without any success. The legendary poem "<a href="Kanhadade%20Prabandha">Kanhadade Prabandha</a>" claims that on one occasion, the <a href="Chahamanas%20of%20Jalor">Jalore Chahamana</a> ruler <a href="Kanhadadeva">Kanhadadeva</a> sent an army in Sitala Deva's aid. The joint force defeated the Delhi army, killing the invading commanders Nahar Malik and Khandadhara Bhoja.

Siege.
In 1308, Alauddin decided to personally lead an expedition to Siwana. He started his march from Delhi on 2 July 1308, and took charge of the siege operations in Siwana in August-September 1308. The Delhi army surrounded the fort from all sides, with Alauddin leading the contingent stationed on the eastern side of the fort. Malik Kamal al-Din 'Gurg' (or Kamaluddin) was in-charge of the <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s ("munjaniqs").

The Delhi army tried to capture the fort using many methods, including a shower of arrows from the siege engines. For over three months, the defenders foiled their attempts, by throwing fire and stones at them. Meanwhile, the invaders had been constructing a "pasheb", an inclined mound reaching up to the fort <a href="battlement">battlement</a>s. Once the mound was completed, Alauddin's army scaled the fort walls, and defeated the defenders after a full day of battle.

The "<a href="Kanhadade%20Prabandha">Kanhadade Prabandha</a>" claims that Sitala Deva was betrayed by a man named Bhayala, with whose helped Alauddin defiled the main water tank of Siwana with cows' blood. As the cows are <a href="cow%20in%20Hinduism">sacred to Hindus</a>, Siwana lost its main source of water. Facing a desperate situation, the women of the fort committed "<a href="jauhar">jauhar</a>" (mass self-immolation), while the men decided to fight to their deaths.

Sital Deva tried to flee to <a href="Chahamanas%20of%20Jalor">Jalor</a>, but the Delhi soldiers ambushed and killed him on 10 November 1308. His head was later presented to Alauddin. The contemporary writer <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a> states that he was a man of huge stature, and Alauddin was astonished on seeing his giant head. The 16th century historian <a href="Firishta">Firishta</a> incorrectly states that Sitala Deva ultimately surrendered by sending a golden statue of himself to Alauddin and asking for a pardon (which was granted). Firishta appears to have confused Sital Deva with the Kakatiya king Prataparudra.

After the conquest, Siwana was renamed Khayrabad. It was assigned to Malik Kamal al-Din 'Gurg', who later led the army that captured Jalore.

Unite The Right Rally.

Lee</a>, a cause Kessler had taken up a year earlier when began his crusade against Bellamy. Kessler was also involved in a smaller protest of the removal of the statue on May 14, 2017 which ended in a torch lit march. At the event he was arrested for failure to obey an officer's commands. On July 11, Kessler appeared at town hall to promote his rally, but also distance himself from another rally that was held by the <a href="Loyal%20White%20Knights%20of%20the%20Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan</a>.

The rally on August 12 turned violent and resulted in the death of Heather Heyer, killed by one of the rally attendees. On the day following the rally Kessler attempted to hold a news conference in front of Charlottesville city hall which was quickly overtaken by protesters. However, before ending the short news conference Kessler stated "I disavow any political violence and what happened yesterday was tragic." He also posted videos online in which he blames the city for the violence and death.

On August 18, 2017, Kessler contradicted his previous statement by tweeting "Heather Heyer was a fat, disgusting Communist. Communists have killed 94 million. Looks like it was payback time." The next morning Kessler repudiated the tweet and blamed <a href="Ambien">Ambien</a>, <a href="Xanax">Xanax</a>, and alcohol for the tweet. He received criticism for the tweet from <a href="white%20nationalists">white nationalists</a> including <a href="Richard%20Spencer">Richard Spencer</a> and Tim Gionet.

<doc id="54883149" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54883149" title="Auto-Play">
Auto-Play

Auto-Play is a feature used by some websites containing at least one embedded video or audio element wherein the video or audio element starts playing, automatically, without explicit user choice, after some triggering event such as page load or navigating to a particular region of the webpage.

Features.
On a website-by-website basis, auto-play may or may not be configurable. Using technology such as cookies, some websites allow a user to select a volume for sound on one page, and may remember that choice (until changed by the user) when reloading content or loading new content. This feature is not dependent on the auto-play or lack of auto-play nature of the media element or website, as it can be applied to non-auto-play elements as well.

Elements with auto-play sounds may or may not allow the user to directly adjust the sound volume with the element itself, and the element may default to a particular sound level (relative to sound settings already set at the browser or system level).

Some websites may employ hooks to allow on media element, once finished, to trigger the auto-play of another elements. This feature may or may not involve a new page load. This feature is not necessarily dependent on whether the starting media element was itself started manually by the user or via an auto-play trigger.

Applications.
Auto-Play may appear as a feature in website advertisements and in website content. The embedded elements may use such technology as Flash Player, streaming media, or pre-recorded media. It may appear as part of the webpage (for example, advertisements and embedded video) or more prominently (for example, webpages dedicated to a specific media element, such as a movie or Flash game).

Various technologies may be used, in tandem or on their own, to support auto-play.

Auto-Play can serve as a convenience to the user (for example, auto-play of a movie of some other media element), or an attempt to attract a user's attention, which may or may not also be a convenience (for example, advertisements, embedded video in a news story webpage).

Criticism and support.
For some applications (generally when applied to content a user is not likely to have been looking for, such as advertisements), auto-play is discussed in some tech forums and by some tech groups as "bad practice".

For other applications (such as webpages dedicated to specific media elements a user is likely to have been targeting, such as a specific video or audio recording), the ostensible convenience factor of auto-play may be accepted or even expected by the user.

<doc id="54883206" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54883206" title="People's State of Bavaria">
People's State of Bavaria

The People's State of Bavaria () was a short-lived attempt to establish a <a href="socialist%20state">socialist state</a> in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> during the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319">German Revolution of 1918–19</a>. It survived from 8 November 1918 until the proclamation of the <a href="Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic">Bavarian Soviet Republic</a> on 6 April 1919.

Background.
The roots of the state lay in the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>'s defeat in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and the social tensions that came to a head shortly thereafter. From this chaos erupted the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319">German Revolution of 1918</a>. At the end of October 1918, German sailors began a series of revolts in various naval ports. In early November, these disturbances spread the spirit of civil unrest across Germany.

Extensive constitutional reforms of the governing structure of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Kingdom of Bavaria</a>, under discussion between the royal government and all parliamentary groups since September 1917, were agreed to on 2 November 1918. These included, among other things, the introduction of <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> and the transformation of the <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional</a> into a <a href="parliamentary%20monarchy">parliamentary monarchy</a>. However, events on the ground were outpacing these measures.

Beginning on 3 November 1918, protests initiated by the left-wing socialist <a href="Independent%20Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany</a> (USPD) called for peace and demanded the release of detained leaders. On the afternoon of 7 November 1918, the first anniversary of the <a href="October%20Revolution">Russian revolution</a>, <a href="Kurt%20Eisner">Kurt Eisner</a>, a USPD politician addressed a crowd estimated to have been about 60,000 on the <a href="Theresienwiese">Theresienwiese</a> (current site of the <a href="Oktoberfest">Oktoberfest</a>) in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>. He demanded an immediate peace, an eight-hour workday, relief for the unemployed, abdication of Bavarian <a href="King%20Ludwig%20III">King Ludwig III</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">German Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>, and proposed the formation of workers' and soldiers' councils. The crowd marched to the army barracks and won over most of the soldiers to the side of the revolution. That night, King Ludwig fled from the <a href="Munich%20Residenz">Residenz Palace</a> in Munich with his family and took up residence in <a href="Anif%20Palace">Anif Palace</a>, in nearby <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>, for what he hoped would be a temporary stay. He was the first of the <a href="List%20of%20German%20monarchs%20in%201918">monarchs in the German Empire</a> to be deposed. The next day, Eisner declared Bavaria a "<a href="free%20state%20%28government%29">free state</a>" – a declaration which overthrew the <a href="monarchy">monarchy</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Wittelsbach">Wittelsbach</a> dynasty which had ruled for over 700 years, and Eisner became <a href="Minister-President%20of%20Bavaria">Minister-President of Bavaria</a>.

Eisner government.
On 12 November 1918, King Ludwig III signed the <a href="Anif%20declaration">Anif declaration</a> releasing both civil and military officers from their oaths; the newly-formed Eisner government interpreted this as an abdication. (To date, however, no member of the royal House of Wittelsbach has ever formally renounced the throne.)

Though he advocated a <a href="socialist%20republic">socialist republic</a>, Eisner distanced himself from the <a href="Russian%20Socialist%20Federative%20Soviet%20Republic">Russian</a> <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s, declaring that his government would protect <a href="property%20rights">property rights</a>. For a few days, the Munich <a href="social%20market%20economy">social market economist</a> <a href="Lujo%20Brentano">Lujo Brentano</a> served as People's Commissar for Trade ("Volkskommissar für Handel").

On 7 January 1919, a Provisional State Constitution ("Vorläuﬁges Staatsgrundgesetz") was promulgated.

As the new government was unable to provide basic services, Eisner's USPD was defeated in the <a href="Bavarian%20Landtag%20elections%20in%20the%20Weimar%20Republic%231919">January 1919 election</a>, coming in sixth place. On 21 February 1919, as he was on his way to parliament to announce his resignation, he was shot dead by the right-wing <a href="nationalism">nationalist</a> <a href="Anton%20Graf%20von%20Arco%20auf%20Valley">Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley</a>, who had been rejected from membership in the <a href="Thule%20Society">Thule Society</a> because of Jewish ancestry on his mother's side. This assassination caused unrest and lawlessness in Bavaria, and the news of a left-wing revolution <a href="Hungarian%20Soviet%20Republic">in Hungary</a> encouraged communists and <a href="anarchism">anarchists</a> to try to seize power.

Hoffmann government.
On 7 March 1919, the leader of the majority <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democratic Party of Germany</a> (SPD), <a href="Johannes%20Hoffmann%20%28SPD%29">Johannes Hoffmann</a>, formed a coalition government, but was unable to muster political support.

On 17 March 1919, another Provisional State Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria ("Vorläufiges Staatsgrundgesetz des Freistaates Bayern") was promulgated, giving a new name to the state.

Demise.
On 6 April 1919, a new <a href="Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic">Bavarian Soviet Republic</a> was formally proclaimed and the Hoffmann government fled to <a href="Bamberg">Bamberg</a> in Northern Bavaria. In less than a month, the soviet republic itself was overthrown by remaining loyal elements of the <a href="Reichswehr">German Army</a> and the "<a href="Freikorps">Freikorps</a>". The <a href="Bamberg%20Constitution">Bamberg Constitution</a> was enacted on 14 August 1919 creating the <a href="Free%20State%20of%20Bavaria">Free State of Bavaria</a> within the new <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a>.

Murder of Marta del Castillo

Marta del Castillo Casanueva (July 19, 1991 – January 24, 2009) was a Spanish <a href="high%20school">high school</a> student who disappeared and was presumably murdered on January 24, 2009. Despite extensive searches and the conviction of Miguel Carcaño Delgado in 2011, <a href="murder%20conviction%20without%20a%20body">her body has never been found</a>. The case is popularly known in <a href="Spain">Spain</a> as the Disappearance of Marta del Castillo ("Desaparición de Marta del Castillo") or simply as the Marta del Castillo Case ("Caso Marta del Castillo").

Disappearance.
Del Castillo was <a href="online%20chat">chat</a>ting with a friend through <a href="Microsoft%20Messenger">Messenger</a>, Silvia Fernández, when she left the conversation with the line "Gordaaa t djo q sta l migue abajo y bvoy a abal con el luego t llamo y t cnto ttQ" ("Fatty, I leave you because "[e]l Migue" is downstairs and I'm going to talk to him. I call you later and tell you. Love you."). Around 17:00, she told her family she would spend the afternoon with friends and left the family home in Seville's <a href="Argantonio">Argantonio</a> Street. An unidentifed friend claimed to have left her on her apartments block's entrance around 21:30 of the same day, but she never made it upstairs. After searching for her in the area, the family denounced her disappearance to the police around 2:00 AM. They also attempted to contact her <a href="cell%20phone">cell phone</a> but it was off or without coverage.

"El Migue" was the nickname of 19-year old Miguel Carcaño Delgado, Del Castillo's "de jure" ex-boyfriend, although they continued to see each other. Carcaño moved to nearby <a href="Camas%2C%20Seville">Camas</a> to live with his new girlfriend, 14-year old Rocío P. G., immediately after Del Castillo's disappearance. Previously, he resided in an apartment owned by his older half-brother, Francisco Javier Delgado Moreno, in Seville's 78 <a href="Leo%20XIII">León XIII</a> Street. When informed that Del Castillo was missing, some of her friends went to León XIII to look for her, and noticed that the place smelled strongly of <a href="bleach">bleach</a> and <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>.

The disappearance was published on the national press two days later, with the family stating that "any help" leading them to Del Castillo would be "welcome."

Investigation.
The case was investigated by the Underage People Task Force ("Grupo de Menores") of the <a href="Spanish%20National%20Police">Spanish National Police</a>. After Carcaño's confession, it was joined by the Homicide Task Force ("Grupo de Homicidios"). Carcaño denied his involvement in repeated interrogations, but P. G. claimed to have seen blood on Carcaño's pants, and the lining of Carcaño's jacket tested positive for Del Castillo's blood. A <a href="luminol">luminol</a> test in León XIII also revealed a large bloodstain on the bedroom floor.

Carcaño was interviewed again on February 14. Upon hearing of P. G.'s testimony and the existence of <a href="forensic%20evidence">forensic evidence</a>, he collapsed and confessed to the murder. According to this testimony, Carcaño murdered Del Castillo during an argument on the night of January 24. The reason for the argument was Carcaño's relationship with P. G. and Del Castillo's threat to tell P. G. about her own continued relationship with Carcaño if he didn't stop seeing her. The murder weapon was a heavy ashtray which was never found, but that Carcaño claimed to have used to hit Del Castillo on the left side of the <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a>, killing her. Carcaño also claimed to have called a friend, Samuel Benítez Pérez, from a <a href="payphone">payphone</a> in León XIII Street, and to have requested his help moving the body to Camas. Once there, they threw the body on the <a href="Guadalquivir%20River">Guadalquivir River</a> near a point called Charco de la Pava. Police suspected that Carcaño was not telling the whole truth. Among other things, he claimed that the vehicle used to move the body was his own <a href="moped">moped</a>, but tests showed that it was not stable enough to transport three people in that area, even without accounting for one of them being dead.

Arrests.
On February 16, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Spain%29">Minister of the Interior</a> <a href="Alfredo%20P%C3%A9rez-Rubalcaba">Alfredo Pérez-Rubalcaba</a> announced that Carcaño and Benítez were both arrested under charges of <a href="homicide">homicide</a> and illegal detention. Also arrested were Carcaño's half-brother and a 15-year old friend of Carcaño and Benítez, later identified as Francisco Javier García Marín, alias "<a href="El%20Cuco">El Cuco</a>".

Guadalquivir River search.
218 officers of the Police's <a href="Grupo%20Especial%20de%20Operaciones">Special Operations Group</a>, the <a href="Guardia%20Civil">Civil Guard</a>'s Underwater Specialist Groups, and the <a href="Military%20Emergencies%20Unit">Military Emergencies Unit</a> searched the Guadalquivir between Camas and the stuary at <a href="Sanl%C3%BAcar%20de%20Barrameda">Sanlúcar de Barrameda</a>, using 22 vessels, 3 <a href="jet%20ski">jet ski</a>s, 2 <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s, 13 <a href="scent%20hound">scent hound</a>s, and a <a href="sonar">sonar</a> and specialized underwater body retrieval technology lent by the <a href="Dutch%20Police">Dutch Police</a>. A <a href="Gelves">Gelves</a> dock engineer also designed, built and volunteered a <a href="rake%20%28tool%29">rake-like tool</a> capable of removing mud from the bottom of the river.

Three separate tests with pig carcasses weighting 50 <a href="kilogram">kilogram</a>s were made. The bodies submerged several times, but in all three cases they ended on the surface and stuck in a particular strech of riverbank that was only 20 <a href="kilometer">kilometer</a>s long. However, no trace of Del Castillo was found. Police worked with the hypothesis that the large volume of the Guadalquivir in January and the three weeks between the murder and Carcaño's confession had been enough to either wash the body out to sea before the search began, or to entomb it in the bottom mud, which can be two <a href="meter">meter</a>s thick in some areas.

Also searched were over 40 wells, canals, sewage plants and pipes. A "bloodstained cloth" found in an irrigation canal near Camas was revealed to be just painted red after testing.

"El Cuco"'s version.
In his own testimony (later recanted), "El Cuco" stated that he arrived to León XIII with Benítez, where they found Carcaño wrapping Del Castillo's body in a blanket under the supervision of Delgado. Delgado then threatened him and his family to silence him, and stayed at the apartment to clean the evidence while the other three disposed of the body. Police believed that Delgado planned the strategy to follow after the murder, based on this testimony and phone conversations between Carcaño and Delgado while both were in <a href="remand%20%28detention%29">remand</a>. In one conversation, Delgado told Carcaño to "say nothing, because the police has nothing."

Carcaño's second version.
On March 18, during the customary reconstruction of the crime at Leon XIII, Carcaño surprised the Police when he requested to recant his previous testimony and make a new one. In this second statement, Carcaño blamed the murder on "El Cuco", saying that he had strangled Del Castillo in Delgado's living room while Carcaño was in the bedroom under the influence of "substances". Afterward, he phoned Benítez and they disposed of the body in a dumpster in the cross between León XIII and <a href="Jorge%20de%20Montemayor">Jorge de Montemayor</a> streets. 

Carcaño claimed that he had felt pressured by the Police to make his first testimony. Following this second testimony, the other three accused were requested to make new statements of their own, and they were confronted with Carcaño and each other to study their reaction. Benítez and "El Cuco" claimed to not be involved at all, and to not have visited Delgado's apartment in the day of the crime. "El Cuco"'s lawyer called Carcaño's second statement a joke and remarked the innocence of his client. Also critical was Del Castillo's father Antonio, who accused the suspects of being deliberatedly misleading about the body's location because they were hiding additional crimes against his daughter. Del Castillo speculated that his daughter had been cremated in an <a href="incinerator">incinerator</a> where P. G.'s father had been employed in previously.

Because of Carcaño's new statement, the search team was alerted and directed from the river to the Montemarta-Cónica landfill near <a href="Alcal%C3%A1%20de%20Guada%C3%ADra">Alcalá de Guadaíra</a>, where the trash generated in Seville is processed.

Carcaño's third version.
On March 19, confronted with the "unbelievability" of the crime reconstruction in León XIII, Carcaño requested to recant and make yet another statement before the <a href="examining%20magistrate">examining magistrate</a>. This time, Carcaño said that he had been drinking, smoking and taking drugs with Del Castillo and "El Cuco" at León XIII. Around midnight, the two males attempted to have sex with Del Castillo, and when she resisted, they beat her and took her to the bedroom, where they threatened her with a <a href="navaja">navaja</a> and Carcaño <a href="rape">rape</a>d her, followed by "El Cuco". Afterward, they tied her to the bed with <a href="insulating%20tape">insulating tape</a> and an <a href="extension%20cord">extension cord</a>. Carcaño punched her hard enough to make her bleed, and they strangled her together. The body was disguised with two trash bags, moved out of the apartment on a wheelchair previously used by Carcaño's dead mother, and thrown in the dumpster while "El Cuco" disposed of the navaja on a sewer. Though autorities were not entirely convinced by this version, it explained the finding of the navaja in the sewer in front of the apartment, the presence of Del Castillo's blood and <a href="DNA">DNA</a> of both Carcaño and "El Cuco" in the bedroom, the finding of cells belonging to both Carcaño and Del Castillo in the wheelchair's handlers, and the testimony of a neighbor who had met Carcaño when he returned to the building with the empty wheelchair.

Witnesses to the statement claimed that Carcaño had looked the magistrate in the eye for the first time and appeared to have taken a load off his mind after he was finished. Carcaño's lawyer renounced to continue representing him after this point. When asked about why he had implicated Benítez and said that he had disposed of the body in the river, he claimed that he had told the Police what they wanted to hear back then. He also denied any involvement from his half-brother, whom he claimed had left the apartment at 20:30, ten minutes after Carcaño arrived there with Del Castillo. Carcaño also denied to have talked about the murder with P. G., in contradiction with her own testimony, which stated that he had told her "everything." It was estimated that in the time between the disappearance and Carcaño's new version, around 65,000 tons of trash had arrived to the landfill. As a result, it would be "very difficult" to locate the body. Landfill employees and policemen revised 60,000 tons over the course of 32 days unsuccessfully, even though they knew a particular area where the trash was dumped in the days following the murder. They also found no human DNA in the dumpsters that Carcaño had said were used to dispose of the body. Eventually, Police concluded that Carcaño had not thrown the body in a dumpster, and speculated that he had falsely confessed a rape with the intention of obtaining a <a href="bench%20trial">bench trial</a> rather than a <a href="trial%20by%20jury">trial by jury</a>.

Provisional release of Delgado, Benítez and "El Cuco".
On May 21, Delgado was released with the condition that he visited the courthouse every monday. Reasons included the fact that Delgado's part in the crime was necessarily small, if any, and that his <a href="alibi">alibi</a> had been partly confirmed by <a href="mobile%20phone%20tracking">mobile phone tracking</a> placing him on the road to <a href="Carmona%2C%20Seville">Carmona</a> at 21:01. Delgado, who had always denied his involvement, offered to take a <a href="polygraph">polygraph</a> test, but the magistrate rejected the idea. After his release, Delgado made a press statement accusing his half-brother of lying to him, and about his involvement in the case.

Benítez was released on December 10. He had requested to be released on two previous occasions, but he was denied arguing gravity of the suspected crime and a risk of <a href="tampering%20with%20evidence">tampering with evidence</a> after release. "El Cuco", being under 18 years of age, was recluded in a <a href="juvenile%20detention%20center">juvenile detention center</a> for the maximum legal time (9 months), and moved to a supervised home afterward.

Evidence in vehicles owned by the family of "El Cuco".
"El Cuco" first claimed that the trio used his mother's <a href="Volkswagen%20Polo">Volkswagen Polo</a> to move the body from León XIII to the Guadalquivir. This car was washed a few days after Del Castillo's disappearance, but it tested positive for blood in luminol and <a href="benzidine">benzidine</a> tests. However, no DNA could be extracted from the blood as it was too degraded. Police also found DNA of a man and a woman in the car, which belonged to neither the victim nor the suspects. It was assumed to belong to "El Cuco"'s mother and her boyfriend, but neither agreed to provide a DNA sample for comparison.

In December, it was discovered that a <a href="Renault%2019">Renault 19</a> and a <a href="Ford%20Escort%20%28Europe%29">Ford Escort</a> abandoned since August on Seville's streets, with flat tires and no license plates, also belonged to "El Cuco"'s mother and her boyfriend, contradicting their claims that they only owned the Polo. The Renault was retired and destroyed on November 27, before the discovery was made, but the Ford could be retrieved for testing. DNA of a man and a woman that was neither Del Castillo nor any of the accused was found in the Ford. The female DNA belonged to the same woman as the DNA in the Polo.

Trials.
Pre-Trial Hearing.
A pre-trial hearing was held on March 13, 2010. Rocío P. G., who faced no charges, was declared for a hour and a half. She said that Carcaño had told her that he had thrown Del Castillo's body in a wooden area near Camas. Previously, she had claimed that he had buried it in a ditch some 600 meters from this new location, which led to two unsuccessful searches there earlier in the year. P. G. also stated that Carcaño had not been at her home in the night of the crime, as he had claimed, but that he had left his cell phone there, explaining why mobile phone tracking data placed him there at the time. When questioned about a threatening call that she had received during the investigation, she denied that she had identified Francisco Javier Delgado as the maker of the call, and remarked that she had merely picked his voice among several anonymous recordings played to her by Police. Journalists speculated that this clarification was a result of P. G. feeling intimidated after Delgado sued her for <a href="perjury">perjury</a> in the week leading to the hearing. Nevertheless, P. G. cast doubt on her own reliability as a witness when she non-chalantly claimed to have lied to Police, and flaunted that "If I lie to Police, I [can] lie to anyone," in a statement found baffling by the present. P. G.'s mother and grandmother also testified in regards to their three-week cohabitation with Carcaño in the family home. At the end of her declaration, P. G. walked pass Carcaño and suffered a <a href="panic%20attack">panic attack</a>.

Carcaño declined to make a new statement. The judge only questioned him once, in regards to the location of Del Castillo's body. Carcaño lowered his head and said, "I don't know." The last person to testify was the mother of "El Cuco", who said that her son had no access to her car because she kept the only existing key.

Ordinary Court Trial.
The first trial, presided by Judge Francisco de Asís Molina, began on April 12, 2010. Miguel Carcaño was charged with two instances of rape, one of murder, one of crimes against moral integrity and one of corpse <a href="desecration">desecration</a>. Francisco Javier Delgado, his girlfriend María García Mendaro, and Samuel Benítez each faced a charge of concealment of a crime, corpse desecration and crimes against moral integrity, with Delgado receiving an additional charge for making threats. The prosecution's version of the crime largely followed Carcaño's third version of the murder, with the differing claim that Delgado and García made it to the apartment after Benítez and were involved in the disposal of the body. It also mentioned "El Cuco" as one of the main perpetrators, who was to be tried separatedly in <a href="juvenile%20court">juvenile court</a>. The prosecution requested a sentence of 52 years in prison for Carcaño.

On February 1, 2011, Carcaño testified before Court, stating this time that Del Castillo wasn't raped, he killed her alone with the ashtray, and stayed in León XIII to clean up the crime scene while Benítez and "El Cuco" disposed of the body in the river.

Juvenile Court Trial.
"El Cuco"'s trial began on January 24, 2011. The presiding judge was Alejandro Vián. "El Cuco" stood charges for rape, murder and a crime against moral integrity due to his prevention of Del Castillo's receiving a funeral; he plied innocence and claimed to not know the location of the body, blaming his four previous confessions to have concealed the murder on Police's pressures. Carcaño, Delgado, Benítez and García were called to testify as witnesses, while "El Cuco"'s father declined to testify. The prosecution requested six years of interment in a juvenile detention center, three under supervised freedom, and a 616,319 <a href="euro">euro</a> fine, the cost of the unsuccessful search for Del Castillo's body.

On March 24, 2011, "El Cuco" was found guilty of the charge of concealment and was sentenced to three years in a juvenile detention center and one month of supervised freedom. The verdict allowed "El Cuco"'s past interment to be counted as part of his sentence, meaning that he would be released less than a year after the trial. He was found innocent of the charges of rape and murder, and not liable to pay for the expenses incurred during the unsuccessful search for the body. The verdict caused controversy because it relied on the identity of Carcaño as the main perpetrator, even though this wasn't proven yet since Carcaño's own trial had not finished.

The Adventures of Dennis

The Adventures of Dennis is a collection of <a href="short%20story">short stories</a> for children written by Soviet author <a href="Viktor%20Dragunsky">Viktor Dragunsky</a>. They deal with the life of an 8-year-old boy in Moscow in the late 1950s and 1960s, modelled on the author's son. The first story was written in 1959; by 1961 a collection was published as a book. The total numer of stories is about a hundred. 

The stories show a wide range of tone, with Dragunsky mixing the poetic, the satirical and the sentimental. A 1999 review in the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Slavonic%20Journal">New Zealand Slavonic Journal</a> describes the stories as "beautifully written" and offering "a rich psychological profile of Russian children".

"The Adventures of Dennis" were popular in India, where they existed in English and Marathi translations. One reason for their popularity was that they were more relatable when compared to English children's literature. In 2016 they were for the first time translated directly from Russian into Hindi and Marathi.

Charlotte Chanter

Charlotte Kingsley Chanter (1828–1882) was a British writer best known for a book that helped set off a Victorian fad for collecting ferns in Devonshire.

Biography.
Charlotte Kingsley was born in <a href="Devon">Devon</a> to the Reverend Charles Kingsley and Mary Lucas Kingsley. Her older brothers <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles</a> and <a href="Henry%20Kingsley">Henry</a> both became novelists, as did her niece, <a href="Lucas%20Malet">Lucas Malet</a>. She spent her childhood in <a href="Clovelly">Clovelly</a>, Devon, where her father was curate and then rector. She moved to London in 1836. Her husband, John Mills Chanter, became the vicar of Holy Trinity Church in <a href="Ilfracombe">Ilfracombe</a>.

Chanter's 1856 book "Ferny Combes" was the first book to draw public attention to the great diversity of ferns to be found in Devonshire. Her book focused mainly on ferns discoverable within an easy distance of the coast. Like other botanizing authors of this period, she encouraged people to dig up rare ferns, contributing to the increasing rarity of certain Devon ferns.. Her brother Charles coined the term <a href="pteridomania">pteridomania</a> for this Victorian craze for ferns.

Chanter's 1861 novel "Over the Cliffs" had elements of both the <a href="gothic%20novel">gothic novel</a> and the <a href="sensation%20novel">sensation novel</a>, with a plot revolving around murder and an inheritance. Although it is said to have been well received in its day, it was panned by at least one critic.

Josephine Myers-Wapp

Josephine Myers-Wapp (February 10, 1912-October 26, 2014) was a <a href="Comanche">Comanche</a> weaver and educator. After completing her education at the <a href="Haskell%20Institute">Haskell Institute</a>, she attended <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Indian%20School">Santa Fe Indian School</a>, studying weaving, dancing and cultural arts. After her training, she taught arts and crafts at <a href="Chilocco%20Indian%20School">Chilocco Indian School</a> before joining the faculty of the newly opened <a href="Institute%20of%20American%20Indian%20Arts">Institute of American Indian Arts</a> (IAIA) in <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe</a>. She taught weaving, design, and dance at the Institute and in 1968 was one of the coordinators for a dance exhibit at the <a href="1968%20Summer%20Olympics">Mexican Summer Olympic Games</a>. In 1973, she retired from teaching to focus on her own artwork, exhibiting throughout the Americas, in Europe and in the Middle East. She has works in the permanent collections of the IAIA and has been a featured exhibitor at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. Between 2014 and 2016, she was one of the showcased artists in a collection of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> women artists, exhibited at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Indian%20Arts%20and%20Culture">Museum of Indian Arts and Culture</a> in Santa Fe.

Early life.
Josephine Myers was born on February 10, 1912 on her grandmother's allotment, near <a href="Apache%2C%20Oklahoma">Apache, Oklahoma</a> to Hevah (née Lena Fischer) and James H. Myers. She was one of nine siblings: Mima, Randlett Cragg, Rudolph Fisher, Catherine, Josephine, Melvin, Walker, Vincent, and Alvin. Myers attended <a href="American%20Indian%20boarding%20schools">St. Patrick's Indian Mission School</a> in <a href="Anadarko%2C%20Oklahoma">Anadarko</a> and completed her high school studies at the <a href="Haskell%20Institute">Haskell Institute</a> in <a href="Lawrence%2C%20Kansas">Lawrence, Kansas</a>, studying to become a secretaary. In 1933, she changed direction, going to study at <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Indian%20School">Santa Fe Indian School</a>, under a program designed to train Native American instructors to teach art at the Indian Boarding Schools. For two years, she studied both <a href="fingerweaving">fingerweaving</a> and <a href="loom">loom</a>-woven textile creation, as well as <a href="pottery%20making">pottery making</a> under <a href="Maria%20Martinez">Maria Martinez</a>.

Career.
In November 1934, Myers returned to Oklahoma and founded the first <a href="arts%20and%20crafts">arts and crafts</a> classes at <a href="Chilocco%20Indian%20Agricultural%20School">Chilocco Indian School</a>. When she began her work, only one loom had been purchased, but with help from other departments at the school, looms and <a href="spinning%20wheel">spinning wheel</a>s were crafted. She taught <a href="basket%20weaving">basket weaving</a>, <a href="beading">beading</a>, and simple pottery to beginners and more advanced students studied creation of <a href="rag%20doll">rag doll</a>s, <a href="cross-stitch">cross-stitch</a>, <a href="dyeing">dyeing</a>, fingerweaving, rag weaving and spinning. She continued teaching art and married around 1940 with Edward Wapp, giving birth to their first child, Barbara in August of that year. The couple's son <a href="Edward%20Wapp%2C%20Jr.">Ed Jr.</a>, who would become a noted <a href="Native%20American%20flute">Native American flautist</a>, was born in 1943. Through the years at Chilocco, she expanded the arts department and by the 1950s was heading the school's drama department, which performed ceremonial dances for the <a href="White%20House%20Conference%20on%20Children%20and%20Youth">White House Conference on Children and Youth</a> in 1960. Returning to school in the summers, Wapp earned her bachelor's degree in education in 1959 from <a href="Oklahoma%20State%20University">Oklahoma State University</a>. She taught at Chilocco until 1961 and then moved to the Santa Fe Indian School before being selected as one of the first teachers for the newly established <a href="Institute%20of%20American%20Indian%20Arts">Institute of American Indian Arts</a> (IAIA).

Wapp was one of the main teachers of traditional arts at IAIA and her classes included beadwork, <a href="Costume%20design">costume</a> and <a href="fashion%20design">fashion design</a>, traditional art techniques, textiles, and weaving. Focused on utilizing primarily natural materials, she taught not only aesthetic appreciation of Native-inspired garments and accessories, but tried to impart the tribal traditions from which the techniques had arisen. Wapp also taught a course in <a href="Fancy%20dance">traditional Indian dance</a>. While at IAIA, she learned the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Woodlands">Eastern Woodlands</a> tribal tradition of finger weaving, which was not a part of Comanche heritage. Of the three basic patterns woven without a loom, Wapp became most known for the arrow point pattern, which is the most difficult. She also continued her own studies earning a masters degree from the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Mexico">University of New Mexico</a>. She encouraged her students to take the skills they had learned in their home economics courses and utilize them in her "Traditional Techniques" course, as an expression of their tribal pride. 

In 1968, Wapp and a colleague at IAIA, ceramicist <a href="Otellie%20Loloma">Otellie Loloma</a> coordinated a dance exhibition for their IAIA students, which they performed at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> and then at the <a href="1968%20Summer%20Olympics">1968 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>. Two years later, the school organized a Fashion Club, which began participating in fashion shows throughout the United States. Students quickly realized that by participating in Wapp's classes, they would be able to create their own designs and travel. In 1972 alone, she took students to shows in <a href="Houston%2C%20Texas">Houston, Texas</a>, the Indian Fashion Show at the <a href="Denver%20Art%20Museum">Denver Art Museum</a>, to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and exhibited original clothing designs at the historic <a href="La%20Fonda%20on%20the%20Plaza">La Fonda on the Plaza</a>. The following year, she retired from teaching to focus on her own artwork.

After retirement, Wapp participated in demonstrations of hand weaving techniques and widely spoke on traditional arts. She served on the committee which worked to found the <a href="Comanche%20National%20Museum%20and%20Cultural%20Center">Comanche National Museum and Cultural Center</a> in Lawton and her works were among those displayed at the inaugural opening in 2007. She served on the Museum board for several years and in 2009 was the featured artist at an event which showcased her works for her 97th birthday. Wapp's works were among those featured at the inaugural opening of <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20American%20Indian">The National Museum of the American Indian</a>'s Manhattan Branch in 1994, to help raise funds for the 2001 projected opening of the Museum of the American Indian at the <a href="National%20Mall">National Mall</a> in Washington, D. C. In 2009, her works were exhibited at the <a href="Oklahoma%20State%20Capitol">Oklahoma State Capitol</a> in a solo exhibition titled "The Artistic Legacy of Josephine Myers-Wapp: The Weaving of Stories and Tradition". In 2013, she was the recipient of the Povi’ka Award of the <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Indian%20Market">Santa Fe Indian Market</a> in recognition of her leadership and support to Native American artists and communities.

Death and legacy.
Wapp died on October 26, 2014 in Lawton, Oklahoma and was buried at the Fairview Cemetery in Apache. Between 2014 and 2016, an exhibit held honoring Native American women artists, featured works by <a href="Jeri%20Ah-be-hill">Jeri Ah-be-hill</a>, <a href="Margarete%20Bagshaw">Margarete Bagshaw</a>, and Wapp and were displayed at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Indian%20Arts%20and%20Culture">Museum of Indian Arts and Culture</a> in Santa Fe. The <a href="Institute%20of%20American%20Indian%20Arts%23Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Native%20Arts">IAIA Museum</a> has pieces of her work in its permanent collection. Her teaching career was widely influential. <a href="Wendy%20Ponca">Wendy Ponca</a>, who followed Sandy Wilson in leading the Traditional Techniques courses in 1982, drew on Wapp and Wilson's legacy in her teaching designers of Native fashion into the 1990s. She also won numerous awards for her contemporary clothing designs, taking the first prize from the Santa Fe Indian Market each year from 1982 to 1987. Phyllis Wahahrocktah-Tasi, director of the Comanche National Museum and Cultural Center was also one of Wapp's students.

Hotel del Charro

The Hotel del Charro was a resort hotel in <a href="La%20Jolla">La Jolla</a>,
California, famous for its discreet hospitality to deal-making
politicians, wealthy industrialists, and Hollywood celebrities,
including <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a>, <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a>,
<a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a>, <a href="William%20Powell">William Powell</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, <a href="Mel%20Ferrer">Mel Ferrer</a>,
and La Jolla native <a href="Gregory%20Peck">Gregory Peck</a>. "Charro" in Spanish is a
costumed horseman.

History.
First constructed in June, 1931, as a riding club, the
predecessor to the del Charro was located at the junction of La Jolla
Canyon (now Torrey Pines Road) and Ardath Road (now La Jolla Parkway)
on a 4 acre tract. Until 1937, it was run by a Miss Jean Moore, after
which it was purchased by a Captain W.W. Beckwith, who operated it as
La Jolla Riding Stables.

About 1945, the property was sold to Mr. and Mrs. J.R. Marechal, of <a href="Texas">Texas</a>,
who converted it to a motor hotel with riding facilities, opening as
the Rancho del Charro in 1948. Because of its proximity to the <a href="La%20Jolla%20Playhouse">La Jolla Playhouse</a>,
which had been founded by Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, and Mel Ferrer in 1947,
the hotel soon hosted many <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>
and <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> celebrities.

In 1951 the Marechals sold the property to a Nevada corporation widely
understood (by insiders) to be controlled by Texas billionaires
<a href="Clint%20Murchison%20Sr.">Clint Murchison</a> and <a href="Sid%20Richardson">Sid Richardson</a>. (E.g., funds
for the purchase were borrowed from an insurance company owned by
Murchison.) Renamed the "Hotel del Charro", the buildings were remodeled and a
swimming pool was added. Thereafter, one or another of the co-owners
were frequently in residence at the hotel.

Heyday.
“Serious citizens in La Jolla tend to feel that Hotel del Charro is a
Texas enclave, not too much concerned with the town’s welfare,”
observed a local in 1954.. By then, the hotel was nationally famous. A New
York Times piece on <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>'s post-war boom described it as a
"fabulous hostelry" with every guest room having either a private
patio, sundeck, or balcony. "Its restaurant, built around a huge
jacaranda tree, has not one chef, but two, one imported from Scotland,
the other from Palm Springs." The pool was described as "Texas-size",
crescent-shaped, with pool-side cabanas.

Celebrity guests of the time included John Wayne, Elizabeth Taylor,
William Powell, <a href="Jimmy%20Durante">Jimmy Durante</a>, and <a href="Betty%20Grable">Betty Grable</a>, along with
Murchison's Texas oilman friends Effie and Wofford Cain, Emily and Billy Byars,
and Jodie and Pug Miller. A Texas flag flew overhead, and there was
a Dow-Jones stock ticker machine in the lobby.

Close to the <a href="Del%20Mar%20racetrack">Del Mar racetrack</a> (itself later acquired by Murchison
and Richardson), the hotel attracted wealthy horse-race aficionados.
A 1956 article in the "Daily Racing Form" by the hotel's own general
manager gave this description of racing season at the hotel: "The
chauffeurs arrive from town with the longest and blackest of the
<a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> products. All are air-conditioned, about the same
length as a Pullman car, and a trifle less expensive. One of these
belongs to oil tycoon Roy Woods, who has a dollar for every drop
of water in <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a>. Bob Bowden, the 6-foot 6-inch maître
d’hôtel, is discussing J. Edgar Hoover’s dinner for Vice President
Nixon with the chef."

Hoover, along with companion <a href="Clyde%20Tolson">Clyde Tolson</a>, was
accustomed to staying at the hotel for two weeks every year during
racing season, occupying "Bungalow A", one of the hotel's stand-alone cabins.
Columnist <a href="Jack%20Anderson%20%28columnist%29">Jack Anderson</a>
reported in 1971 that Hoover's bill was always "comped" by the hotel's
owners. According to Anderson, manager Witwer told him that over the
years Hoover ran up a total tab of $15,000.

Hoover sometimes entertained guests in his bungalow, one of whom was
<a href="Arthur%20Samish">Arthur Samish</a>, a lobbyist who was said to represent organized crime
interests in the liquor industry, and another of whom was
<a href="Howard%20Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>. On first entering the bungalow, Hughes
reportedly asked for Hoover's assurance that the premises
were not bugged.

Senator Joseph McCarthy was another frequent guest. “McCarthy was
virtually on Murchison’s payroll,” manager Allan Witwer related.
“He’d get drunk and jump in the pool, sometimes naked. He urinated
outside his cabana, flew everywhere in Murchison’s plane.”
Eventually, after one drunken brawl too many, McCarthy was declared
persona non grata at the hotel.
<a href="Joan%20Crawford">Joan Crawford</a> was another celebrity declared persona non grata,
reportedly for flirting excessively with billionaire co-owner Richardson.
Physicist <a href="Leo%20Szilard">Leo Szilard</a>, famous as author of the <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd%20letter">Einstein–Szilárd letter</a> to
President Roosevelt, lived with his wife Trudy for many years until his death in 1964
in one of the more elaborate bungalows on the property. His guests
from time to time included <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>, <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>, and other famous physicists.
Last days.
The Hotel del Charro finally closed in the early 1970s. The buildings
were razed and replaced by condominiums, now known as "Del Charro Woods".
Some of the larger trees are original to the property.

In popular culture.
The Hotel del Charro plays a prominent role under the fictitious name
"Rancho Descansado" in <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a>'s final
<a href="Philip%20Marlowe">Philip Marlowe</a> novel, <a href="Playback%20%28novel%29">"Playback"</a>. Chandler had
lived in La Jolla, which
has become "Esmerelda" in the novel, for the previous decade. A cab driver character
describes the place as, "Bungalows with car ports. Some single,
some double. Office in a small one down front. Rates pretty steep
in season." Marlowe and other characters are attacked on the premises.

Black and White Like You and Me: Parallel Lines Sometimes Intersect

Black and White Like You and Me: Parallel Lines Sometimes Intersect is a work of non-fiction by Thomas F. Daniels and Thomas C. Marsh. The book recounts two parallel lives spanning the 50s, 60s & 70s. One black, one white; one living on the west side of Detroit and one living on the east side of Detroit. The book offers the perspective of each man as they live through some of the most dramatic events of the city's history as well as each man's personal journey. The parallel lives intersected in the 1980s with the hard conversations about race and the decades old division of blacks and whites in the metropolitan Detroit area. The two formed a friendship and a mission to get the conversation going for others..

Ovington's Bank

Ovington's Bank is a novel set during a 1925 banking crisis, by the English historical novelist <a href="Stanley%20J.%20Weyman">Stanley John Weyman</a>, published in 1922 by <a href="John%20Murray%20%28publisher%29">John Murray</a>. It was republished in 2012 and 2015 and is currently available in paperback.

Setting and plot.
The novel is set immediately before and during the British <a href="Panic%20of%201825">Panic of 1825</a>, which was caused largely by a fraud involving "Poyais", an imaginary South American country. As a result, about 70 banks failed. The novel follows the effects of the events on two fictional English communities named Aldersbury and Garth.

Weyman, a well-known novelist of the period, describes the conflict between the old-established rural gentry, whose wealth is drawn as landowners exploiting large estates, and the striving bourgeoisie, drawing theirs from banking and industry.

The novel, set a century before publication, has a conventional plot involving an exaltation of honesty and love as a way of overcoming pride and prejudice. It stresses that the bank had been run very carefully. As a recent scholar put it, the bank was "solvent, amply solvent", but customers "would rush in at the first alarm, like a flock of silly sheep... each bent on his own safety, blindly on ruin." Another recent commentator has called it a notable attempt "to depict the ways in which urbanization and Reform politics had helped to shape the broad outlines of the Victorian world."

Televised.
The novel was adapted for <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television in 1965 as "Heiress of Garth" in six episodes of 25 minutes. The director was <a href="Paddy%20Russell">Paddy Russell</a> and the cast included <a href="Bernard%20Archard">Bernard Archard</a>, <a href="William%20Mervyn">William Mervyn</a>, <a href="June%20Ritchie">June Ritchie</a>, <a href="Mary%20Webster%20%28actress%29">Mary Webster</a> and <a href="David%20Weston%20%28actor%29">David Weston</a>.

Nritya

Nritya (<a href="IAST">IAST</a>: Nṛitya, नृत्य), also referred to as Nrit, Nritta, Natana or Natya, refers to "dance, act on the stage, act, gesticulate, play" in the Indian traditions. It is sometimes sub-divided into two forms: "nritta" or pure dance, wherein expression-less movements of a dancer play out the rhythms and phrases of the music; and "nritya" or expressive dance, wherein the dancer includes facial expression and body language to portray mood and ideas with the rhythmic movements to communicate with the audience.

"Nritya" is broadly categorized as one of three parts of <a href="Sangita">Sangita</a>, the other two being "gita" (vocal music, song) and "<a href="vadya">vadya</a>" (instrumental music). These ideas appear in the Vedic literature of <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> such as in the "Aitareya Brahmana", and in early post-Vedic era Sanskrit texts such as the "<a href="Natya%20Shastra">Natya Shastra</a>", "<a href="Panchatantra">Panchatantra</a>", "Malvikagnimitra" and "Kathasaritsagara". 

Nritya and Nata appears in Vedic era literature. For example, section 4.104 of "Unadi Sutras" mentions Nata as "dancer, mime, actor". The "Unadi Sutras" existed before the time of <a href="P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini">Pāṇini</a> (6th to 4th century BCE). Panini too mentions the terms Nritya and Nartaka respectively as dance and dancer, in his treatise on Sanskrit grammar.
The term Nritya appears in all major classical Indian dance forms as one form of their repertoire, inspired by the guidelines of the "<a href="Natya%20Shastra">Natya Shastra</a>". These are "Nritta", "Nritya" and "Natya":

Zu Yong Diao

Zu Yong Diao was a way of taxation of <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> China, per-modern <a href="Japan">Japan</a>，<a href="Korea">Korea</a> and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. The Zuyongdiao consists of Zu, the tax paid in <a href="grains">grains</a>, Yong that was paid in <a href="corvee">corvee</a> and Diao which was paid in <a href="textiles">textiles</a>.
In China.
Zuyongdiao was paired with the policy of <a href="land%20equalization">land equalization</a> and was effective according to the later policy. The land equalization provides equally divided grain fields to farmers. Every farmer will pay a fixed amount of grain as tax under the name of Zu. The basic unit of tax collection was thus one individual. Yong was a tax paid in unpaid laboring. Every citizen in Tang dynasty works 20 days per year for the government without payment. If the person is handicapped, he or she pays Yong by weaving textiles.

The practice of Zuyongdiao in China was hindered by the <a href="An%20Lushan%20Rebellion">An Lushan Rebellion</a>. After the turbulence ended, the Tang court lost a considerable amount of individuals who were able to pay the tax (Deaths and casualties during the rebellion were severe). The consequence was that Zuyongdiao no longer collects a sufficient amount of taxes.

The system's weakening also has its sociological factors. It collects taxes one by one from every subject of the imperial court. Since every citizen has to pay his due, one could only afford to pay the tax if he has his own fields to cultivate. However, not everyone possessed grain fields. In addition, during the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Gaozong%20of%20Tang">Emperor Gaozong of Tang</a> and <a href="Wu%20Zetian">Empress Wu</a>, owners of large plantations began to annex lands owned by self employed farmers. The annexation caused farmers to lose lands and consequently their inability to pay the Zu, Yong and Diao as an individual. The flaw within the system only worsened during the following years. Landless farmers were forced out of their home and became vagabonds, the imperial court had lost the exact registration of households. In the end, local officials had no resource of taxation because objects of taxation were completely lost (Either deceased, fled to other prefectures or in poverty). 

In 780, the Zuyongdiao was abolished according to the advice of Chancellor <a href="Yang%20Yan">Yang Yan</a> and was substituted by the <a href="Two-Tax%20system">Two-Tax system</a>.
Applicable Objects.
According to the <a href="Tang%20Code">Tang Code</a> edited by chancellor <a href="Zhangsun%20Wuji">Zhangsun Wuji</a>, the amendment of 27th article states that an object of taxation and corvee has to be a male aged between the age of 21 and 59. Female objects are only responsible of paying taxes if her spouse could not fulfill the duty while there is no male members in the family to substitute. Government officials and physically disabled ones were exempted from taxation and corvee.

In Japan.
In 646, <a href="Emperor%20K%C5%8Dtoku">Emperor Kōtoku</a> issued the edict of <a href="Taika%20reform">Taika reform</a>. According to the edict of reform written in Classical Chinese, the 4th resolution states that the old way of taxation is to be abolished while So(Zu), Yō(Yong) and Chō(Diao) are established.

In 757, <a href="Empress%20K%C5%8Dken">Empress Kōken</a>'s <a href="Y%C5%8Dr%C5%8D%20Code">Yōrō Code</a> formalized the system of Soyocho.

Although the Japanese Soyocho was based on the Zuyongdiao of China, it differs slightly in terms of specific ways of collecting the three kinds of taxes.

In Korea.
The Korean <a href="Silla">Silla</a> dynasty established the system of Joyongjo according to its Chinese model Zuyongdiao.<a href="Household%20registration%20system">Household registration system</a> and Joyongjo were together adopted by Silla.

In Vietnam.
Vietnam was under the rule of Tang dynasty as <a href="Annam%20%28province%29">Annan province</a>. As a part of China, Annan's taxes were collected in the form of Zuyongdiao. In <a href="1723">1723</a>, the later <a href="L%C3%AA%20dynasty">Lê dynasty</a> of Vietnam enacted the law of Zuyongdiao as well.The policy was promoted by the <a href="Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh%20lords">Trịnh lords</a> as a part of its fortification of rule in southern Vietnam against <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20lords">Nguyễn lords</a>

<doc id="54884433" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54884433" title="Haddebo Bruk">
Haddebo Bruk

Haddebo Bruk is a Swedish <a href="ironworks">ironworks</a> estate from the 17th century, situated in the village of Haddebo in the southern part of <a href="N%C3%A4rke">Närke</a>. To the estate included two manor houses, the "lower Haddebo" and the "upper Haddebo". Both of the original manor houses are gone, however a replica of the the upper Haddebo Manor has been rebuilt according to the original renderings preserved in the <a href="Nordic%20Museum">Nordic Museum</a>, during the 1990s. 

History.
Haddebo was first mentioned as "Haddeboda" in a "tiondelängd" (a Swedish historical listing of farming estates) in 1555, and in a tax document from 1592. The first map of the region was published in 1637, shortly after which, in 1658 Jacob Classon from Norrköping received rights to start an iron works at Haddebo. Upon Classon's death in 1666, the estate was sold to Mathias Schilt, who after a few years sold Haddebo to the freeman Peder Andersson Wester. Wester had great ambitions for the estate and managed to greatly expand the Haddebo's lands as well as production output. In the late 17th century he had the Manor House "Lower Haddebo" built.

Wester died at the end of the 17th century, which resulted in a split of the estate into Lower and Upper Haddebo when the inheritance was settled in 1703. The estate of Upper Haddebo built a Manor House in the typically Swedish "karoliner" style in the early 18th century.The estates at Haddebo were very productive, producing energy by damming up the surrounding lakes, and producing cast iron. Both the estates stayed in the Wester family for well over a century until the widow of Arvid Wester, sold Lower Haddebo in 1821, and Upper Haddebo in 1826. 

During the 19th centur, the estates frequently changed hands, and belonged to the families Broms and Floor. Lower Haddebo was in 1862 acquired by Per Fredrik Brandelius, a wealthy brewer from Stockholm. Brandelius also owned Lemnå Bruk, and went on to found <a href="%C3%96rebro%20Enskilda%20Bank">Örebro Enskilda Bank</a> (Örebro Private Bank) in the nearby city of <a href="%C3%96rebro">Örebro</a>. Furthermore, Brandelius was the great grandfather of the Swedish diplomat and author <a href="Jan%20M%C3%A5rtenson">Jan Mårtenson</a>. 

Both of the estates in Haddebo were acquired by the Swedish state in 1900 and 1902, and became official royal hunting grounds. <a href="Gustaf%20V%20of%20Sweden">King Gustaf V of Sweden</a> was very fond of hunting Moose at Haddebo and visited the estate almost every year. To this day the forests which surround Haddebo remain royal hunting grounds, and <a href="Prince%20Carl%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20V%C3%A4rmland">Prince Carl Philip</a>, shot his first Moose on the grounds in 2002. 

The buildings at Haddebo suffered greatly during state ownership and both the Manor Houses of Upper and Lower Haddebo perished, Upper Haddebo in a fire 1938 and Lower Haddebo was demolished by the state in 1941. The forestry continued, and so did the electricity production in the dams up until 1965. In the 1970s and 80s the estate faced further decline, up until 1989 when it was acquired by the Hemberg family. 

Drs Per and Elisabeth Hemberg acquired Haddebo in 1989, and began a major restoration project. The original renderings of Upper Haddebo could be recovered from the <a href="Nordic%20Museum">Nordic Museum</a>, and at the place of Lower Haddebo a copy of the Manor House of Upper Haddebo was built. Old material, such as timber, windows and doors from several other 18th century timber houses that were to be demolished, were used for the project. The house was built with techniques used when the original house was constructed to create an image as accurate as possible of the original Manor House. The estate remains in the Hemberg family as a private residence. 

In 2012, Dr Per Hemberg published a book, "Boken om Haddebo" (The book about Haddebo), an enthralling story of how the estate has been rebuilt bit by bit, and while incorporating the most modern technologies, using recycled materials and ancient techniques to stay true to the harmony and feel of a 18th century Swedish karoliner estate. 

In addition to forestry and farming, the estate features a notable stud "Haddebo Seminstation" since 2003, led by Dr Elisabeth Hemberg. 

The village of Haddebo.
Surrounding the estate is the small village of Haddebo, which is the home of the notable Swedish author <a href="Torbj%C3%B6rn%20S%C3%A4fve">Torbjörn Säfve</a>. The village also features a botanical garden "Haddebo Gärdesgård och Blommor", and a B&B "Vita Kralan".

Gabrielle Vallings

Gabrielle Vallings (28 August 1886 – 1969) was a singer and novelist. She was the author <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a>'s literary executor, and she completed the writer <a href="Lucas%20Malet">Lucas Malet</a>'s last novel after Malet's death.

Biography.
Gabrielle Francesca Lilian Mary Vallings was born in <a href="Hythe%2C%20Kent">Hythe, Kent</a>, England, one of nine children of James Frederic Vallings, vicar of <a href="Sopley">Sopley</a>, and Louisa Cadogan Chanter. She was a grand-niece of the novelist <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a>, who made her his literary executor, and a second cousin of his daughter Mary St Leger Kingsley, a writer better known by her pen name <a href="Lucas%20Malet">Lucas Malet</a>. 

Vallings was adopted by the much older Malet while still a teenager. It appears that Vallings may have been briefly engaged to Norman Sladden, a naval officer, in 1916, but there is no record of her ever marrying. Vallings and Malet lived together until Malet's death in 1931, traveling frequently to France. Malet encouraged Vallings to develop her creative abilities, first as a singer and then as a writer. 

Vallings, a soprano, trained to be an opera singer, but it appears her career never took off as there are few records of public performances. She had begun performing by 1914, when a critic noticed her "pleasant soprano voice [and] fine feeling for musical expression" but advised further training. In 1919, she sang at a celebrity-studded pageant in honor of the centenary of Charles Kingsley's birth.

In 1916, Vallings published "Bindweed", the first of her dozen novels, several of which had socialist themes. "Bindweed", which the "<a href="London%20Times">London Times</a>" called "a powerful first novel", centers on the travails of a young opera singer who does not know that she is of illegitimate birth. Her second novel, "Tumult" (1916) features a cast ranging from Australian sheep ranchers and French aristocrats to the Greek god <a href="Pan%20%28god%29">Pan</a>.

Vallings completed Malet's last novel, "The Private Life of Mr. Justice Syme", after the author's death in 1931, and it was published in 1932.

Italian nuclear weapons program

The <a href="Italian%20nuclear%20weapons%20program">Italian nuclear weapons program</a> was an endeavor by <a href="Italy">Italy</a> to develop <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s in the late 20th Century. 
After abortive attempts to develop a multilateral program with other nations in the 1950s and 1960s, Italy launched an indigenous nuclear weapons program, including testing a <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a>. 
The program ceased in 1975.Italian fromer President <a href="Francesco%20Cossiga">Francesco Cossiga</a> declared that these subjects in Italy are covered by statal secrets with silence (writing nothing) and lies (and telling false things to others). Italy is currently part of the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> <a href="nuclear%20sharing">nuclear sharing</a> program.

Background.
At the end of World War II, Italy was quick to realise the geopolitical situation and created a political strategy that relied on multilateralism, principally through a close relationship with the United States, membership of <a href="NATO">NATO</a> and greater European integration. The <a href="Italian%20Army">Italian Army</a> was particularly keen to acquire nuclear weapons, seeing them primarily in a tactical role.

Italy started hosting US nuclear weapons under NATO's <a href="nuclear%20sharing">nuclear sharing</a> policy. The first nuclear weapons deployed were <a href="MGR-1%20Honest%20John">MGR-1 Honest John</a> and <a href="MGM-5%20Corporal">MGM-5 Corporal</a> rockets in 1957. Other weapons followed, including the <a href="MIM-14%20Nike%20Hercules">MIM-14 Nike Hercules</a> <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a>. However, all these systems were under sole US control and so Italy simultaneously pursued dialogue with other European nations on a collaborative nuclear programme. Discussions were held with France and Germany about a joint nuclear deterrent, but these were curtailed in 1958 by <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>'s desire for an independent French deterrent.
The decision by Switzerland on 23 December 1958 to pursue a nuclear weapons programme put an additional impetus on Ilaly. Pressure was made on the United States to provide additional nuclear weapons. On 26 March 1959, agreement was made that the <a href="Italian%20Air%20Force">Italian Air Force</a> would receive 30 <a href="PGM-19%20Jupiter">PGM-19 Jupiter</a> ballistic missiles to operate from <a href="Gioia%20del%20Colle%20Air%20Base">Gioia del Colle Air Base</a>. The first missiles arrived on 1 April 1960. This time the American provided a dual-key system that led the Italian government to believe they had greater control over the deterrent and thus more power in NATO. Explicitly, the new missiles could be used "for the execution of NATO plans and policies in times of peace as well as war". The missiles were operated by a new brigade, the 36ª Aerobrigata.

Multilateral Force.
At the same time as working with the United States, Italy explored working within the NATO <a href="Multilateral%20Force">Multilateral Force</a> (MLF) concept to develop a European nuclear force. MLF was a concept promoted by the United States to place all NATO nuclear weapons not operated by their own services under a joint control, with dual-key control by American and European forces. For the United States, the MLF was an attempt to balance the desire from other members to play a role in nuclear deterrence with their interest in bringing all existing and potential Western nuclear arsenals under the umbrella of a more cohesive NATO alliance. Italy had long argued for nuclear cooperation, with <a href="Italian%20Minister%20of%20Defence">Minister of Defence</a> <a href="Paolo%20Emilio%20Taviani">Paolo Emilio Taviani</a> saying on 29 November 1956 that the Italian government was trying to persuade their "Allies to remove the unjustified restrictions regarding the access of NATO countries to new weapons." The policy was pursued by the <a href="Presidency%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">Kennedy</a> and <a href="Presidency%20of%20Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Johnson</a> administrations, and formed a fundamental part of the negotiations around the <a href="Nassau%20Agreement">Nassau Agreement</a> between the United States and the United Kingdom and the attempted accession of the United Kingdom to the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a> (EEC) in 1961.

Under MLF, the United States proposed that various NATO countries operate <a href="UGM-27%20Polaris">UGM-27 Polaris</a> <a href="Intermediate-range%20ballistic%20missile">IRBM</a> on seaborne platforms, principally nuclear submarines. The Italian Navy took the cruiser out of service and rebuilt the ship between 1957 and 1961 as a guided missile cruiser with launchers for four Polaris missiles. Shortly afterwards, in December 1962, Italian Minister of Defence <a href="Giulio%20Andreotti">Giulio Andreotti</a> officially asked the United States for assistance in developing nuclear propulsion for its fleet.

Italy's indigenous program.
The Italian government saw the growth of the movement to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons as a major challenge to its nuclear programme. At the <a href="Eighteen%20Nation%20Committee%20on%20Disarmament">Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament</a>, the Italian government argued that multilateral activity like the MLF as excluded from any agreement on non-proliferation, but found that the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> required that MLF be terminated as part of their negotiations on the <a href="Treaty%20on%20the%20Non-Proliferation%20of%20Nuclear%20Weapons">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> and the United States all but killed the agreement on 17 December 1964 with National Security Action Memorandum No. 322. At the same time, on 5 January 1963, the United States announced that they would withdraw the Jupiter missiles as a consequence of the <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>. The decision was approved by the Italian government and the missile brigade was deactivated on 1 April 1963.

With the failure of its multilateral efforts, Italy looked again at creating an independent deterrent. Italy had experience with nuclear technology, with a well developed <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> industry with <a href="Boiling%20water%20reactor">BWR</a> , <a href="Magnox">Magnox</a>, and <a href="Pressurized%20water%20reactor">PWR</a> technologies, as well as the 5MW RTS-1 'Galileo Galilei' test reactor at CAMEN (, Center for Military Applications of Nuclear Energy). It also had a large number of nuclear capable aircraft, including the <a href="Lockheed%20F-104%20Starfighter">Lockheed F-104 Starfighter</a>, and was developing the <a href="Panavia%20Tornado">Panavia Tornado</a> with nuclear strike in mind.

Ever since 27 March 1960, when Admiral Pecori Geraldi had argued that a seaborne nuclear force was the most resistant to attack, the navy had looked for an opportunity to take on a nuclear role and had gained experience through the successful test of Polaris missiles from "Giuseppe Garibaldi" in September 1962. Thus, in 1971, the navy started an indigenous ballistic missile program for use on submarines and surface warships or "technology program intended to develop high power solid-propellant boosters for civil and military applications".

The missile was developed quickly. After the first stage motor was fired eleven times in static tests, three test missiles, now named <a href="Alfa%20%28rocket%29">Alfa</a>, with inert second stages were successfully launched from <a href="Salto%20di%20Quirra">Salto di Quirra</a> in <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, the last on 6 April 1976.

At the same time, the combination of high costs and a changing political climate meant that the project was doomed. The program had already cost over 6 billion lira. Yugoslavia was abandoning its own nuclear program; Switzerland would soon do the same. At the same time, there was an increasing risk of nuclear escalation outside Europe and domestic pressure for Italy to take play its part in reducing the nuclear tension. These combined with pressure from the United States led to Italy abandoning its nuclear weapons program and ratifying the <a href="Treaty%20on%20the%20Non-Proliferation%20of%20Nuclear%20Weapons">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> on 2 May 1975.

Nuclear weapons in Italy since 1975.
Italy has remained within the MLF and thus continued to host nuclear weapons on its soil after its own program had halted. Since 1975, the country has been used by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> for deploying the <a href="BGM-109G%20Ground%20Launched%20Cruise%20Missile">BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile</a>, <a href="MGM-52%20Lance">MGM-52 Lance</a> <a href="tactical%20ballistic%20missile">tactical ballistic missile</a> and <a href="W33%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">W33</a>, <a href="W48">W48</a> and <a href="W79">W79</a> artillery shells. The Italian Army unit <a href="3rd%20Missile%20Brigade%20%26quot%3BAquileia%26quot%3B">3rd Missile Brigade "Aquileia"</a> was trained to use the munitions until the United States Army removed their last nuclear weapons from Italy in 1992 when they withdrew the last Lance missile.

Current situation.
The country is part of the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> <a href="nuclear%20sharing">nuclear sharing</a> program.
<a href="B61%20nuclear%20bomb">B61 nuclear bomb</a>s could be used by the <a href="Italian%20Air%20Force">Italian Air Force</a> in time of war.

Zadruga (movement)

Zadruga, Movement of Polish Nationalists Zadruga, was a Polish neopagan nationalist movement founded in 1937 by <a href="Jan%20Stachniuk">Jan Stachniuk</a>, which published a monthly political and cultural bulletin "Zadruga". The group focused around this magazine was the most active neopagan group during the inter-War 1918-1939 period in Poland, having around 300 followers in 1939. The Zadruga movement has never become an organization with a formal membership. Its spiritual guide was <a href="Antoni%20Wacyk">Antoni Wacyk</a>, who was promoting a return to <a href="Slavic%20native%20faith">Slavic native faith</a>. Jan Stachniuk was promoting his ideology of <a href="culturalism">culturalism</a>, aiming at unification of Western Slavic peoples, based on the reconstruction of their original national culture and cultural strength, as opposed to the presumed anti-cultural influence of Christianity, especially of the Catholic clergy, promoting laxism, escapism, and consumption. This should prepare these nations for the inevitable confrontation with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Russian</a> and <a href="Drang%20nach%20Osten">German expanionism</a>. Each nation should build its own strength thought its "collective matrix", named "<a href="zadruga">zadruga</a>" after the original Slavic notion of the organization of rural communities. The Western Slavic nations should function as one centralized state with the <a href="collective%20ownership">collective ownership</a> of land and industry, based on grass-root enthusiasm and heroism. 

During the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, under the German occupation, the Zadruga members first began leading an <a href="Education%20in%20Poland%20during%20World%20War%20II">underground educational activity</a>. In 1943 they formed a political party "Stronnictwo Zrywu Narodowego", and subsequently the military organization "Zryw", which in autumn 1943 joined the <a href="Home%20Army">Home Army</a>. Some of the Zadruga members were arrested by <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>, imprisoned in the <a href="KZ-Dachau">Dachau</a> and <a href="KL%20Sachsenhausen">Sachsenhausen</a> concentration camps, where they popularized the political ideas of "Zadruga" among other Polish prisoners. After the war, in 1945-46 some these liberated prisoners continued their educational and publishing activity in Scotland.

In 1945-47, as part of the Nationalist opposition, they were publishing "Zryw" in Poznań and "Arkona" journals in Bydgoszcz. In 1949 all the leaders of the movement were arrested by the Communist regime, accused of collaboration with neo-Fascism and sentenced in 1952. After the amnesty in 1956, they were liberated, but did not restore the former activities, which transformed into an informal intellectual movement, concentrated in Wrocław. The attempts in the 1980s and 1990s to restore it as an association were not successful. 

After 1989 the elements of the ideology of "Zadruga" were used by <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20Tejkowski">Bolesław Tejkowski</a> in his ideology of Polish <a href="Anti-clericalism">anti-clerical</a> nationalism of the Social-National Union ("Unia Społeczno-Narodowa"). The ideology was also propagated separately by the <a href="Toporze%C5%82">Toporzeł</a> Publishing House . Many of the former participants of the informal Zadruga intellectual groups are now members of the<a href="National%20Movement%20%28Poland%29">National Movement (Ruch Narodowy)</a> or of the Nacjonalistyczne Stowarzyszenie "Zadruga" . 

The foundational writings of Stachniuk and Wacyk are used now by certain Polish <a href="Slavic%20native%20faith">Slavic native faith</a> groups, especially by the Union of Native Faith (<a href="Rodzima%20Wiara">Rodzima Wiara</a>) and by the .

Jefferson County Courthouse (Illinois)

The Jefferson County Courthouse is a government building in <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20Illinois">Mount Vernon</a>, the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Illinois">Jefferson County</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Built in 1939 by the federal <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a>, it is the fifth <a href="courthouse">courthouse</a> to serve Jefferson County.

Early history.
The first settlers in the county were Andrew Moore and his family, who arrived in 1810, but he and one of his sons were killed by Indians, and his wife and her remaining children left and settled in <a href="Equality%2C%20Illinois">Equality</a>. The first <a href="surveying">surveyors</a> came in 1815, and some of them returned in the following year to settle in the area. The first <a href="Illinois%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> after statehood enacted a law in 1819 creating Jefferson County and appointed a team of commissioners to locate the county seat, provided that the landowner donate land for the foundation of the town. This law specified a location at which the commissioners were to meet, and within a week the commissioners chose the meeting location for the new county seat. A few individuals wished for a different location, but no significant dissension ever arose, and the commissioners chose "Mount Vernon" as the name of the new town, due to <a href="Mount%20Vernon">their reverence for George Washington</a>.

Previous courthouses.
At their first meeting, the county commissioners' court ordered the construction of a courthouse, to be a simple log building with a single door and window, and to be completed by September 1819. Although the contract was fulfilled, the building was quickly subjected to significant modifications: winter proved that the building could not be kept warm, and by March 1820, the county's costs had mushroomed from the original $85 to $160 merely for the difficulties of chinking the cracks between the logs, building a fireplace and chimney, and constructing a platform inside the courthouse. As primitive state law required the construction of a stray pound and a jail in a new county seat, both structures were ordered in 1820 to be built nearby. 

Although this courthouse was not considered particularly safe, the county court had no desire to erect a replacement. The situation changed completely on a calm, quiet night in 1839; the first people stirring in the morning discovered that the courthouse had partially collapsed, leaving a hole on one side large enough to drive a wagon through, and the remains were pulled down with ropes. Their hands having been forced, the commissioners began making arrangements for a replacement, a square brick building on each side with a <a href="cupola">cupola</a> atop the roof. Set on the public square, this building opened for use in 1840, but unfortunately for the builder, tax revenues had been poor, and he had to wait until 1841 to receive the $5,500 due him by the construction contract. This building remained until 16 March 1869, when it was consumed by an overnight fire that popular reputation ascribed to a drunken sheriff. Two years passed before its replacement was completed, and this building stood only seventeen years before a tornado destroyed it, together with most of the rest of Mount Vernon, on 19 February 1888. A replacement was finished in 1889.

Current courthouse.
The fifth and current courthouse is one of six <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> county courthouses in Illinois. A concrete <a href="Art%20Deco%20architecture">Art Deco</a> structure three <a href="storey">stories</a> high, it features a wide staircase on the facade that provides access to the three-<a href="bay%20%28architecture%29">bay</a> entrance. Its basement is set only partially below ground, with enough above-ground height that windows are placed throughout the basement walls. The overall plan is irregular, with the second floor being <a href="setback%20%28architecture%29">set back</a> from the first and the third from the second. It was finished in 1939.

<doc id="54885374" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54885374" title="2017 British Columbia wildfires">
2017 British Columbia wildfires

On July 6, 2017, a two-hectare <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a> began west of <a href="100%20Mile%20House">100 Mile House</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Canada marking the beginning of the 2017 British Columbia wildfires. On July 7, 56 new fires started throughout British Columbia (BC) leading to the release of several evacuation alerts, orders and the declaration of a provincial state of emergency by the <a href="Government%20of%20British%20Columbia">Government of British Columbia</a>. As of August 13, there are 140 fires currently burning throughout the province. British Columbia experiences wildfires every year, but this series of fires have so far been the worst in the provinces history. 
Fire progressions.
On July 6, the first of many major fires began, starting at two-hectares and quickly progressing to be eight times larger by that evening requiring the issue of an evacuation alert that same day. By July 7, 140 fires started throughout BC with most being in the central interior. The fires were aggressive and grew quickly prompting a state of emergency as well as several evacuation alerts and orders. The next day, 182 total fires were active throughout the province prompted the issuing of up to 20 evacuation alerts and orders. The Emergency Operating Centre in Prince George was activated in addition to Emergency Social Services opening a reception center and lodging at the <a href="College%20of%20New%20Caledonia">College of New Caledonia</a>. 

Within three days, first major fire that started at two hectares had grown to 4,000 hectares resulting in a mandatory evacuation order being released with up to 2,000 residents being evacuated and by the next day over 10,000 Willians Lake residents were placed on evacuation alert Williams Lake. On July 11, there was a total of 200 fires active with 4,000 evacuees registered in Prince George, resulting in the expansion of lodging to <a href="University%20of%20Northern%20British%20Columbia">University of Northern British Columbia</a> and <a href="Prince%20George%20Secondary%20School">Prince George Secondary School</a>.

State of emergency.
On July 7, a provincial <a href="State_of_emergency%23Canada">state of emergency</a> was declared by <a href="Todd%20Stone">Todd Stone</a>, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, on behalf of the Government of British Columbia. The state of emergency was extended on July 19 and again on August 4, expiring on August 18, 2017. Once again, the state of emergency was expanded, this time until September 1st. This was the first state of emergency for British Columbia in 14 years, and the longest state of emergency in the province's history. 
Cause and contributing factors.
A combination of <a href="Dry%20thunderstorm">dry lightning</a> and human-caused fires are responsible for the 2017 BC wildfires. Human-caused fires have been both accidental and intentional, all wildfires in BC are investigated to determine the fire origin and cause. Fire bans and restrictions have been put in place to limit further human caused fires.

Heat waves and minimal rainfall throughout the province leading up to the wildfires had dried out vegetation and soil. As well, pine forests containing large amounts of dead pine trees due to the <a href="mountain%20pine%20beetle">mountain pine beetle</a> was optimal fuel for fires. With consideration of these contributing factors, most areas of BC were rated as extreme or high risk of fire danger. The wildfires quickly grew in size as a direct result of strong winds with some regions reaching high winds of up to 70 km/h.

On July 4, a car crash on <a href="Highway%201">Highway 1</a> near <a href="Cherry%20Creek%20British%20Columbia">Cherry Creek, BC</a> caused a 15-hectare that was later contained with a crew of 47 fire personnel, 11 planes and a helicopter.

Causation.
39,000 people have been evacuated from their homes to date and 30,000 cattle have been threatened. The wildfires have reportedly destroyed over 300 buildings ranging from homes and barns to commercial structures.

On July 15, a BC Wildfire Service helicopter crashed in the <a href="Chilcotin%20Country">Chilcotin</a> region during firefighting duties. The only crew on board was a pilot that suffered non-life threatening injuries.

Resources.
As of August 13, 3,906 fire personnel have been deployed to fight the fires including 647 out of province personnel and 1,606 contractors. Crews are fighting the fires with assistance of 233 helicopters and airplanes. In addition, 50 Australian firefighters and 108 fire personnel from Mexico have come to BC's aid. 

Over 15 reception centres were opened province wide by Emergency Social Services. In addition, five cities ranging from <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> to <a href="Williams%20Lake">Williams Lake</a> had opened group lodging centres for evacuees. The Red Cross has opened support centres and is distributing financial assistance in the form of $600 per adult and $300 per child as promised by Premier <a href="Christy%20Clark">Christy Clark</a>.

Air quality.
Smoke from the wildfires drifted southwestward over the populated areas of <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> in early August, causing air quality to worsen significantly.

Bourne Windmill, Oakdale, New York

<a href="List%20of%20windmills%20in%20New%20York">Bourne Windmill, Oakdale, New York</a> .

It was located North of his South shore estate, known as <a href="Indian%20Neck%20Hall">Indian Neck Hall</a>, which later became <a href="La%20Salle%20Military%20Academy">LaSalle Military Academy</a>. The windmill was demolished in 2004-2005.

History.
The Bourne Windmill was built in 1911 by Commodore Frederick G Bourne, designed by noted architect <a href="Alfred%20Hopkins">Alfred Hopkins</a>. It was part of the Bourne Dairy Farm, the Windmill Works were built by the Andrew J Corcoran Company, which supplied water for the dairy, farm, farmhouse, fountains and fire hydrants. The Windmill tower stood approximately one hundred feet high, topped by the windmill twenty five feet in diameter. The tower was an octagonal design, constructed of reinforced concrete pillars with terracotta block between, and stucco on the exterior. The upper portion of the tower housed a large metal water tank, and the lower portion was used as a silo. The Windmill was noteworthy in its height and construction, and artistic design, incorporating terracotta Rams Heads at the top of the tower. The farm buildings fell into disrepair and were damaged by vandalism, and were demolished around 1975.

Younger Now (song)

"Younger Now" is a song recorded by American singer <a href="Miley%20Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> for her upcoming sixth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> <a href="Younger%20Now">of the same name</a> (2017). It was released on August 18, 2017, by <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Records</a> as a second single from the record. The song was written by Cyrus and <a href="Oren%20Yoel">Oren Yoel</a>, and produced by Yoel. An accompanying music video was released on the same day.

Background and release.
After "<a href="Miley%20Cyrus%20%26amp%3B%20Her%20Dead%20Petz">Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz</a>" (2015), Cyrus spent the time reclaiming her once wholesome image in the run up to her new material, "<a href="Younger%20Now">Younger Now</a>". Ahead of the album's September 28, 2017, release date, she premiered alt-country pop gems like "<a href="Malibu%20%28Miley%20Cyrus%20song%29">Malibu</a>" and "<a href="Inspired%20%28song%29">Inspired</a>", before unveiling the album's title track on August 19, supported by a music video. It is a twangy pop song, that features a grade school portrait as the cover artwork. 
Composition.
Lyrically, the track is a soaring reclamation of the changes Cyrus has experienced over the last several years, ending with a declaration that she now is the best version of herself. "I'm not afraid of who I used to be / No one stays the same," she proclaims. "Change is a thing you can count on / I feel so much younger now".

Critical reception.
"<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"'s Maeve McDermott claimed that "the song is infinitely more listenable than most of the music from her "Dead Petz" phase", but criticized Cyrus for "not offering much in the way of meaningful self-reflection on the song".

Music video.
Background and sypnosis.
The song was accompanied by a music video featuring a "mishmash" of 50s-inspired imagery. In the video's most on-the-nose moment, one of the sideshow characters that populate its carnival setting spins upside down on a stripper pole, as the words "No one stays the same" flash in front.

Reception.
"USA Today" estimated the the stripper scene is "a flashback to Cyrus grinding on <a href="Robin%20Thicke">Robin Thicke</a> and twerking in the "<a href="We%20Can%27t%20Stop">We Can't Stop</a>" video during her "<a href="Bangerz">Bangerz</a>" years".

Hanomag F-series

The Hanomag F-series is a series of medium-duty trucks built by <a href="Hanomag">Hanomag</a>, then Hanomag-Henschel after a 1969 merger with the <a href="Henschel%20%26amp%3B%20Son">Henschel</a> company, in their <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> Seebaldsbrück plant from 1967 until 1973. It was replaced in favor of the more conservative <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20T2">Mercedes-Benz T2</a> after that company took over Hanomag-Henschel. The F-series badge was also used on the smaller "Harburger Transporter" as well as on some rebadged <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20T2">Mercedes-Benz T2</a> models.

Model History.
Rheinstahl-Hanomag AG developed an entirely new range to replace the heavier models in the Hanomag Kurier/Garant/Markant range, and to fill the gap between the old Tempo products and the heavier Hanomag trucks. It was a simple <a href="Vehicle%20frame%23Ladder%20frame">ladder frame</a> design. The designer, frenchman Louis Lucien Lepoix, was also responsible for a number of designs for <a href="Magirus-Deutz">Magirus-Deutz</a> and <a href="B%C3%BCssing">Büssing</a>. The F-series was available in several weight capacities ranging from the F45 to the F76. The numbers ending in a "5" received four-cylinder engines; those ending in a "6" a six-cylinder. The engines were all inline diesels from the all-new D-100 range which was simultaneously introduced in Hanomag's tractor lineup. The F66 and F76's <a href="Straight-six%20engine">straight-six</a> unit produces at 3400 rpm. The smallest F45 has . In addition to trucks, the F76 was also available as a <a href="tractor%20unit">tractor unit</a>. In 1969 the air-sprung F76 LL was introduced, and the name was changed to Hanomag-Henschel subsequent to the amalgamation of the two branches. There was also a heavier yet F86 introduced later, with a .

<a href="Thyssen%20AG">Rheinstahl</a>, the owners of both Hanomag and Henschel, merged the companies in 1969 and sold a controlling interest in the resulting Hanomag-Henschel company to <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>. Rheinstahl suffered further financial setbacks and sold the remainder of the company to Mercedes-Benz at the end of 1970. Mercedes-Benz kept building certain parts of the Hanomag-Henschel lineup, in areas where Mercedes-Benz themselves were weak, but the F-series was thus disconinued in 1973, after only six years on the market. The Bremen factory had begun producing the smaller "Harburger Transporter" (F20-F35) alongside the F-series trucks in 1969 and continued to do so after the larger trucks were discontinued. The plant went on to build Mercedes-Benz' <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20TN">"Bremer Transporter"</a>.

Other F-series vehicles.
While the original F-series was only offered as a truck, panel van and minibus versions of the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20T2">Mercedes-Benz T2</a> (built in <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>) were also sold with Hanomag-Henschel F-series badging, beginning in 1970. These used the headlights from the F and a Hanomag-Henschel grille. This badge-engineered version continued to be available into the latter half of the 1970s. The smaller "Harburger Transporter", thus called because it was built in <a href="Harburg%2C%20Hamburg">Harburg, Hamburg</a>, was also sold with Hanomag (and Hanomag-Henschel) F-series badging, F20, F25, or F35 depending on the weight rating. Based on an older design by <a href="Tempo%20%28company%29">Tempo</a>, it was built as a Hanomag-Henschel until 1975 and as a Mercedes-Benz until 1977.

Steyr.
The cabin was also used by <a href="Steyr-Daimler-Puch">Steyr</a> of Austria for their 590 and 690 series of trucks, introduced in 1969. They did use Steyr's chassis and engines, however. While the bodies were originally sent to Austria, the pressing tools were sent there after manufacture came to an end in Bremen. Steyr developed a thoroughly modernized model in 1982, called the 591/691. This had a short life as as the licensing, as well as all the manufacturing tools, was transferred to India's <a href="Tata%20Motors">Tata Motors</a> in the mid-eighties. The resulting <a href="Tata%20407">Tata 407/709</a> was built from 1986 until 2014.

The attackers took hostages after being cornered by police and were killed in an ensuing shootout.

Background.
Since the <a href="2011%20Libyan%20civil%20war">2011 Libyan civil war</a>, instability had spread into central Africa, in particular northern Malawi/<a href="Azawad">Azawad</a> where French forces intervened to oust the rebels from <a href="Ansar%20Dine">Ansar Dine</a> and <a href="MOJWA">MOJWA</a>.

Ouagadougou was also the site of a <a href="2016%20Ouagadougou%20attacks">similar attack in 2016</a>, which took place in the same district as the 2017 attack. Later that year, the region was struck again with the <a href="2016%20Grand-Bassam%20shootings">2016 Grand-Bassam shootings</a>.

Attack.
The attack started at about 21:00 <a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">GMT</a> (the same as local time) on 13 August. Witnesses reported that four gunmen arrived to the scene in a pickup truck and opened fire on patrons seated outside the Hotel Bravia and the Aziz Istanbul Restaurant. The attack lasted into the early morning hours of 14 August as the attackers exchanged fire with security forces after barricading themselves in the restaurant. Three attackers were killed by security forces after they were cornered in an upper floor of restaurant and took around 40 hostages.

He stated that the assailants were reported to be young men, who arrived at the restaurant with <a href="AK-47">AK-47</a>s, riding on <a href="motorcycle">motorcycle</a>s. Locals say that the restaurant, popular for its European-style bakery, was host to a birthday party the evening of the attack.

Victims.
18 civilians and a gendarme were killed and they were from eight different nationalities. 
Perpetrators.
It is suspected by the government that <a href="al-Qaeda%20in%20the%20Islamic%20Maghreb">al-Qaeda's Maghreb affiliate</a> was behind the attack.

Arnold Mononutu

Arnold Isaac Zacharias Mononutu (4 December 1896 – 5 September 1983) was a nationalist involved in the struggle for <a href="Indonesia">Indonesian</a> independence. Mononutu gained his sense of Indonesian nationalism during his post-secondary studies in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. In the early years of the Indonesian government, he served as <a href="Information%20Minister">Information Minister</a> and was the first Ambassador of Indonesia to China. He later became <a href="Rector_%28academia%29">Rector</a> of <a href="Hasanuddin%20University">Hasanuddin University</a>.

Early life.
Arnold Isaac Zacharias Mononutu was born in <a href="Manado">Manado</a> on 4 December 1896 to Karel Charles Wilson Mononutu and Agustina van der Slot. Both his father and grandfather were prominent figures in their time. His father was a civil servant or "ambtenaar ()" in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> colonial administration. His grandfather (also named Arnold Mononutu) was the first <a href="Minahasan%20people">Minahasan</a> to complete studies at the school for the training of native physicians (<a href="STOVIA">STOVIA</a> or "School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen") in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>).

When Mononutu was two years old, his father was assigned a position in <a href="Gorontalo">Gorontalo</a>. Four younger siblings were born in Gorontalo, but sadly all four died when they were between five and six months old. In 1903, Mononutu went to the Dutch language elementary school (ELS or "Europeesche Lagere School ()") in Gorontalo. He continued his studies at the ELS in Manado after his father was reassigned to a position in Manado. In 1913, Mononutu went to the Dutch secondary school (HBS or "Hogere burgerschool ()") in Batavia where he met and became friends with <a href="Alexander%20Andries%20Maramis">AA Maramis</a> (also from Minahasa) and <a href="Achmad%20Subardjo">Achmad Subardjo</a>.

Time in Europe.
In 1920, Mononutu headed to Europe to start his studies in the Netherlands. After a couple of years of taking preparatory courses to enroll in a university, he decided to enroll in <a href="The%20Hague%20Academy%20of%20International%20Law">The Hague Academy of International Law</a> or "Académie de droit international de La Haye" in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>. Mononutu initially did not have nationalistic ideals. However, after attending the association for Indonesian students in the Netherlands or "Indische Vereeniging" or "<a href="Perhimpunan%20Indonesia">Perhimpunan Indonesia</a>", Mononutu began to realize the nationalism of Indonesia. He became more involved in the organization and was elected as vice president, the same period in which <a href="Mohammad%20Hatta">Mohammad Hatta</a> was elected as treasurer.

When <a href="Soekiman%20Wirjosandjojo">Soekiman Wirjosandjojo</a> was president of the organization, Mononutu was asked to become a representative of Indische Vereeniging among the student organizations in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. During his time in Paris, the Dutch Political Intelligence Department or "<a href="Politieke%20Inlichtingen%20Dienst">Politieke Inlichtingen Dienst</a>" became suspicious of Mononutu's activities. The colonial government in Indonesia spread false rumors to his father that he was being sympathetic to the communists. His father was threaten to be removed from his position if he continued to send money to Mononutu. When his father stopped sending money to Mononutu, he became dependent on his Indonesian friends. He returned to the Netherlands from France and was allowed to stay with <a href="Ali%20Sastroamidjojo">Ali Sastroamidjojo</a> and his family. Upon secretly receiving money from his father through his uncle who was travelling to the Netherlands, Mononutu was able to pay all his debts and return home to Indonesia in September 1927.

Return to Indonesia.
Upon returning to Indonesia, Mononutu was immediately involved in the local nationalistic efforts. He became a member of the newly formed <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Party">Indonesian National Party</a> or "Partai Nasional Indonesia (PNI)". He also met its founder, <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>, for the first time. Mononutu rented a room in the same house as Suwirjo and <a href="Sugondo%20Djojopuspito">Sugondo Djojopuspito</a> both of whom were leaders of the Indonesian Students Association or "Persatuan Pelajar Pelajar Indonesia". This organization was part of the Second Youth Congress in 1928 that produced the <a href="Youth%20Pledge">Youth Pledge</a> or "Sumpah Pemuda". This pledge proclaimed the three ideals of one motherland, one nation, and one language. The future Indonesian national anthem <a href="Indonesia%20Raya">Indonesia Raya</a> by <a href="Wage%20Rudolf%20Supratman">Wage Rudolf Supratman</a> was first heard in this venue.

Mononutu had started work for a Japanese oil exploration company called Mitsui Buissan Kaisha, but would decide to work for much less pay at the newly established People's College or "Perguruan Rakyat". He managed and taught courses in schools established by Perguruan Rakyat. Other instructors included <a href="Mohammad%20Yamin">Mohammad Yamin</a> and Gunawan Mangunkusumo (the brother of <a href="Tjipto%20Mangunkusumo">Tjipto Mangunkusumo</a>). The schools had a total of around 300 students enrolled. In 1930, Mononutu had to leave his position at Perguruan Rakyat and return to Manado, because he received word that his mother was sick.

Time in Manado and Ternate.
Mononutu would stay in Manado for 12 years from 1930 to 1942. During this time, he became the director of a <a href="copra">copra</a> cooperative. The cooperative had around 500 members who were scattered throughout the regions of Minahasa and Bolaang Mongondow. Mononutu was able to secure credit from the People's General Credit Bank or "Algemene Volkscredietbank" (now <a href="Bank%20Rakyat%20Indonesia">Bank Rakyat Indonesia</a>) to cover the debts of the copra farmers. This allowed the farmers to sell their copra to the cooperative, which offered more stabil and standardized prices. The copra was in turn exported through the "<a href="Nationale%20Handelsbank">Nationale Handelsbank</a>", a Dutch bank that was established to finance trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies.

At the beginning of the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Japanese occupation</a> in 1942, Mononutu was sought by the Japanese because of his nationalistic stance and relationship with nationalist organizations. With the help of a sympathetic Japanese named Yamanishi, Mononutu fled to the island of Ternate (the northern part of the <a href="Maluku%20Islands">Maluku Islands</a>) and remained there until the end of the occupation.

Involvement in the State of East Indonesia.
After hearing of the <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">Proclamation of Indonesian Independence</a> that was proclaimed in 1945, Mononutu focused his efforts to help the people of North Maluku to determine the best response to the proclamation. He was one of the individuals who established a political organization called the Unity of Indonesia or "Persatuan Indonesia". A newspaper called the Tower of Independence or "Menara Merdeka" was published to promote the ideals of Persatuan Indonesia. The paper promoted a pro-republic message and criticized efforts by the Dutch to establish a separate state apart from the recently proclaimed Republic of Indonesia.

Efforts by the Dutch to find a federal solution for Indonesia included the establishment of the <a href="State%20of%20East%20Indonesia">State of East Indonesia</a> or "Negara Indonesia Timur (NIT)" in 1946. Mononutu became a member of the NIT parliament and headed the group of parliament members who were pro-republic. He focused his efforts to persuade other members of parliament to support the notion of unifying NIT with the Republic of Indonesia. After the Dutch military offensive against the Republic of Indonesia called <a href="Operation%20Product">Operation Product</a> or "Agresi Militer Belanda I" in 1947, Mononutu established the Unified Struggle for Indonesian Independence or "Gabungan Perjuangan Kemerdekaan Indonesia". This organization sought to highlight the actions of the Dutch to keep Indonesia as its colony. In February 1948, he led a delegation of NIT officials to visit and meet with the leaders of the Republic of Indonesia in <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>. In 1949, NIT became a constituent of the newly formed <a href="United%20States%20of%20Indonesia">United States of Indonesia</a> or "Republik Indonesia Serikat (RIS)", which was then dissolved on 17 August 1950 and replaced by a unitary Republic of Indonesia.

Information Minister.
Mononutu was appointed Information Minister in the Indonesian government on three separate occasions:

During his time as information minister, several regions in Indonesia were rocked by rebellious uprisings including in <a href="West%20Java">West Java</a> (<a href="Legion%20of%20Ratu%20Adil">Legion of Ratu Adil</a>), <a href="South%20Sulawesi">South Sulawesi</a> (by <a href="Andi%20Aziz">Andi Aziz</a>), and <a href="Maluku">Maluku</a> (by <a href="Chris%20Soumokil">Chris Soumokil</a>). Mononutu along with Sukarno visited these regions and in large open-air meetings promoted the ideal of a unified nation.

Rector of Hasanuddin University.
In 1960, Mononutu was asked by Sukarno to become rector of Hasanuddin University. In the five years as rector, the student population grew from 4000 students to 8000 students. When he started, the university only had three <a href="Faculty%20%28division%29">faculties</a>: economics, law, and medicine. The university would add six more faculties during his tenure: agriculture, animal sciences, engineering, literature, sciences, and social politics.

Honors.
On 15 February 1961, Mononutu was awarded the Bintang Mahaputera Utama, the highest honor given to a civilian by the Indonesian government.

Ateliers Moës-Freres

Ateliers Moës-Freres was an engineering company based in <a href="Waremme">Waremme</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, specialising in engines and <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a>s. The company was founded in 1904 by Guillaume Moës (1854-1929). The company saw its greatest success between the First and Second World Wars. It survived as an independent company until 1969 when it was acquired by VMF Stork-Werkspoor Diesel of <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> (now part of <a href="W%C3%A4rtsil%C3%A4">Wärtsilä</a>).

Founding.
Guillaume Moës was born in 1854 in the hamlet of Bleret between <a href="Remicourt%2C%20Belgium">Remicourt</a> and Waremme. As a young man, he moved to Waremme where he founded a steam mill. His eldest son Édouard as born in 1880 and at the turn of the century he developed an <a href="internal%20combustion">internal combustion</a> engine that replaced the mill's steam engine. Guillaume's second son, Auguste (born 1882) turned out to be a talented <a href="salesman">salesman</a> who promoted the new Moës engine and was able to quickly gain orders from local factories. The mill was quickly turned over to engine manufacturing and in 1904 a new company, Ateliers Moës-Freres, was set up to concentrate on the burgeoning engine business.

Pre-war years.
The company found early success, building and selling several hundred of its engines each year from 1905 onwards. The company continued to expand in the years leading up to the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. In 1912 a spacious new factory was built in Waremme. The company suspended production at the outbreak of war, having produced more than 2500 engines.

After the First World War.
In 1918, the company restarted production, with the youngest of Guillaume's sons, Paul (born 1893), joining the family firm. They expanded into a wide range of engine production, including <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel</a>, <a href="Hot-bulb%20engine">hot-bulb</a> and <a href="electric%20motor">electric</a> engines. In the early 1920s the company began production of <a href="narrow%20gauge">narrow gauge</a> locomotives using their diesel engines as motive power. These early locomotives had bodies that resembled traditional steam locomotives to encourage the adoption of this new technology. Guillaume died in 1929, and the company was taken over by his three sons.

In the 1930s, the company changed its name to SA Moteurs Moës, Waremme. Locomotive production expanded into specialist <a href="mine%20railway">mining locomotives</a> for use underground, and small <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a> shunting locomotives. Moteurs Moës developed an international reputation, selling equipment to France, Italy, the Netherlands, the <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a> and Asia.

The Second World War and afterwards.
During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> Moteurs Moës reduced production, but kept operating throughout. They developed a reputation for protecting their workers during the <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> occupation of Belgium.

After the end of the War, Moteurs Moës rebuilt its business, winning major government-subsidized contracts for marine engines. But, as war-surplus engines came onto the market, this business came to an end and Moteurs Moës focused back onto the narrow gauge locomotive market, particularly for coal mining. In the 1960s, the Belgian coal mining industry collapsed, and with it an important market for the company. The company re-focused onto diesel engines and renamed itself Moës Diesel in 1957. 

Paul Moës died in 1967. Two years later, the company was acquired by Dutch group VMF Stork-Werkspoor Diesel, but remained as an independent division under the Moës Diesel name. The division developed new <a href="hydrostatic">hydrostatic</a> narrow gauge locomotives, an improved mining locomotive, and a new type of standard gauge shunting locomotive.

In 1993, the Moës Diesel division was sold to the BIA Group of Belgium and focused on selling generators and pumps built by the <a href="Hatz">Hatz</a> company. In March 2013, the division's name was changed to Moës Energy. In October 2013, all manufacturing at Waremme ceased.

<doc id="54888111" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54888111" title="Intergovernmental Negotiations framework">
Intergovernmental Negotiations framework

The Intergovernmental Negotiations framework or IGN is a group of nation-states working within the United Nations to further <a href="reform%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">reform of the United Nations Security Council</a> (UNSC). 

Composition.
The IGN is composed of several different international organizations, namely:

Each group represents a different set of positions vis-a-vis reforming the United Nations Security Council. On July 27, 2016, an "oral decision" was adopted by the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> by general acclamation of its members, which approved of a declaration known as the "elements of convergence" which outlined the status of the consensus reached by the members of the IGN at that time. This statement of consensus was based on a text and annex, of a year earlier. Ultimately, by adopting the "elements of consensus" document, the General Assembly decided to form an "Open Ended Working Group" to further develop a consensus position of the entire General Assembly on the issue of reforming the U.N. Security Council. This program had its origins in 1993, with successive reports in 2001 and 2007. The current agenda for this issue in the U.N. General Assembly can be found online.

Positions of each group.
The positions of the various groups of nations composing the IGN framework can be summarized as follows:

The <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a>.
"While the group was pleased that the consensus decision would roll over the issue into the next session, the AU remained committed to a text-based reform process. In particular, the AU called attention to a letter circulated by the group on 21 July 2016, in response to the elements of convergence on working methods and the size of a reformed Council. As the AU pointed out, the “elements” reflect only two out of five of the issues discussed in the IGN process. As such, it does not adequately reflect the record of the IGN in the 70th session, as there was substantial agreement and discussion of the other three issues which was not represented in the elements of convergence text. The AU called for a democratic, transparent, and accountable process, and for text-based negotiations to make the UN ‘fit for purpose.'"

The <a href="G4%20nations">G4 nations</a>.
Brazil, in its capacity as representative of the G4, called for the start of text-based negotiations to give the IGN substantive meaning. The G4 appreciated the elements of conversion text, which served to identify trends and move towards consensus, even if the text does not reflect all G4 positions. However, the Group was disappointed that there was not convergence on the other three issues. The G4 noted that they had hoped to begin concrete negotiations during the 70th session, arguing that the longer Security Council reform is postponed, the greater the discredit to the UN. The status quo is no longer an option, and there is a recognized need for a strong multilateral system. Brazil cited the major agreements reached over the last years—the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement, among others, but noted that the realm of peace and security is noticeably lacking in progress and reform. Brazil concluded its statement with a reminder of the need for a ‘UN fit for purpose on peace and security, in a discrete timeframe.’

The <a href="Uniting%20for%20Consensus">Uniting for Consensus</a> Group (UfC), also known as the "Coffee Club".
"Italy, speaking for the United for Consensus group (UfC)[,] . . . applauded the technical rollover, which paved the way for continued discussion aiming for a broad consensus. It noted that the IGN is a member-driven process, that all sessions and meetings have been important for movement towards consensus, and that the points of convergence submitted by the facilitator reflect UfC’s understanding of the areas of convergence. UfC further called for flexibility and compromise on the remaining issues, in order to lead to a broad consensus decision in the future."

The <a href="L.69%20Group%20of%20Developing%20Countries">L.69 Group of Developing Countries</a>.
"Nicaragua . . ., representing the L69 group of developing countries[, said they were] . . . pleased that the framework and annexes, submitted in 2015, would remain central to the IGN’s work moving forward. The L69 argued that text-based negotiations would be vital, and should be conducted on the basis of the framework text, especially on the other three key issues for reform. In closing, the group hoped that the 71st session would lead to more concrete progress."

The <a href="Arab%20League">Arab League</a>.
"Kuwait, representing the Arab States, reaffirmed the desire for a broad decision and for continuing IGN debates in the 71st session. The group hoped for consensus, in order to lead to true and comprehensive reform."

The <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean Community</a> (CARICOM).
"Guyana, speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), welcomed the rollover, and called for further work and reflection on Member State proposals when considering the achievements of the IGN in the 70th session, as well as the framework and annexes. CARICOM called the progress made important, though limited, and hoped that the text and elements of convergence would be a foundation for reform work in the 71st session."

<a href="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="China">China</a> (UNSC Permanent Members).
"China welcomed the rollover, and called for the next session to uphold the leadership of the UN and Member States, and reflect all the views of participants. Russia welcomed the rollover as well, noting that consensus adoption was good, but that there was far from universal agreement in the negotiations. Russia asked that reforms be adopted with more than a two-thirds majority, though ideally through consensus, and ended with a call for a transparent and inclusive process without artificially imposed timelines."

Functional Attitude Theory

Functional attitude theory (FAT) suggests that <a href="beliefs">beliefs</a> and <a href="Attitude%20%28psychology%29">attitudes</a> are influential to various psychological functions. Attitudes can be influential on many processes such as being <a href="utilitarian">utilitarian</a> (useful), social, relating to values, or a reduction of cognitive dissonance. They can be beneficial and help people interact with the world. In the late 1950s when <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> and <a href="behaviorism">behaviorism</a> reigned supreme as the foci of psychological studies, Smith, Bruner, and White (1956) and Katz (1960) separately and independently developed typologies of human attitudes in relation to the functions to which they believed the attitudes served . This theory proposes that attitudes are held by individuals because they are important and integral to psychological functioning. The function of an attitude is more important than whether the attitude is accurate or correct. 

Background.
<a href="Rhetoric%20%28Aristotle%29">Aristotle’s Rhetoric</a>, renowned for its modes of persuasion in ethos, logos, and pathos, gave mankind its first recorded guide to and theory of <a href="social%20influence">social influence</a>. <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> recognized that different appeals are necessary for different types of persuasion, and that these appeals can be tailored and refined to better suit the audience or better suit the product or idea at hand. In the late 1950s when psychoanalysis and behaviorism reigned supreme as the foci of psychological studies, Smith, Bruner, and White (1956) and <a href="Daniel%20Katz%20%28psychologist%29">Katz</a> (1960) separately and independently developed typologies of human <a href="attitude%20%28psychology%29">attitude</a>s in relation to the functions to which they believed the attitudes served . The goal of these ‘functional attitude theories,’ (FAT) as they would come to be known, was to understand the effect of functional attitudinal states in relation cognition and behavior, and specifically, for Katz (1960), to increase the efficacy of persuasive communications by matching approaches or appeals to the function that the attitude served. 

Smith et al. (1956) concentrated on the links between attitudinal states and personality and interviewed ten men regarding their attitude toward the Soviet Union (Carpenter et. al, 2013). This logically <a href="Inductive%20reasoning">inductive</a> study was too small to make any binding conclusions, and the study’s non-empirical nature meant that it would be dubious as a base for future research, but Smith and colleagues’ foundational theories would go on to inspire and guide future FAT research. Likewise, Katz’s (1960) <a href="Deductive%20reasoning">deductive</a> findings did more to explain and define the general concepts of FAT than it did in guiding the methods of future research. In fact, the lack of earlier research on FAT has been linked to both studies’ failure to provide reproducible and falsifiable methods for future research on the theory (Harris & Toledo, 1997; Shavitt & Nelson, 2002). Despite this lack of methodology, both studies contributed to the basic concepts of FAT as it came of age in the 1980s and on. 

Concepts.
Within FAT, attitudes are considered <a href="Qualitative%20psychological%20research">qualitative</a> variables in relation to the function that they serve. That is, attitudes are the <a href="independent%20variable">independent variable</a> of a set function (utilitarian, social-adjustive, etc.), which influence both <a href="cognition">cognition</a> and <a href="behavior">behavior</a> (<a href="dependent%20variables">dependent variables</a>). Researchers posited that people develop attitudes to serve their goals, and that although any particular attitude might serve multiple functions, it would generally serve one more than the others (Katz, 1960 ; Smith, Bruner, & White, 1956 ). They theorized that although two people might have an attitude with the exact same valence, that attitude might serve very different functions for each person. While different attitudes serve different psychological functions, it is imperative to note that they are not mutually exclusive of one another as similar attitudes may be developed for different reasons by different people; it is the aim of FAT to understand why these attitudes develop to better understand how to <a href="Social%20influence">influence</a> them (Harris & Toledo, 1997). Though different terminology was employed, both Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956) conceptualized similar attitude functions: (1) <a href="utilitarian">utilitarian</a>, (2) social-adjustive, (3) value-expressive, (4) ego-defensive, and (5) knowledge. These five traditional functional attitudes are defined briefly below, followed by a synthesis of recent “neofunctional” FAT studies, and a brief critique of FAT. 

Utilitarian attitudes

Many attitudes serve a <a href="utilitarian">utilitarian</a> function by serving to amplify rewards and minimize the punishments attained from objects in the environment (Katz 1960, Smith et al., 1956). The models of utilitarian attitudes are consequentialist theories: that which creates right acts is their consequences (Miller, 1990). It refers to theories of right action whereas the right act to choose in any situation is the one that will achieve the highest balance of pleasure over pain for all affected beings. When no act is available to which will produce net pleasure, the act which is right will produce the least net pain. As an example, one’s attitude toward ice cream may serve a utilitarian function because it is likely to be based on the reward (e.g., enjoyable taste) and punishments (e.g., weight gain) associated with ice cream and to guide behavior that maxims benefits while minimizing costs (e.g., eating low-fat ice cream) (Shavitt & Nelson, 2002). Based in human beings’ need to discriminate between objects that produce pleasure/increase task efficiency and those that produce pain/decrease task efficiency, utilitarian functions aid in increasing <a href="utility">utility</a> (Carpenter et al., 2013). An individual with a utilitarian attitude is concerned with how an object will assist in improving their quality of life. In terms of products, any T-shirt could be considered utilitarian in terms of its ability to provide comfort and some shelter for an individual. 

Social-adjustive attitudes

Social-adjustive functions are those which regulate <a href="Interpersonal%20relationship">relationship</a>s and enable individuals to climb the social ladder through outward displays of <a href="Social%20status">status</a> which are theorized to make the individual more attractive or popular in the eyes of valued groups. An individual with a social-adjustive attitude is concerned with status, <a href="popularity">popularity</a>, and how they are viewed by others and will seek objects that assist in developing their desired social image (Carpenter et al., 2013). An example of a product with social-adjustive function would be a designer T-shirt, such as one with an embroidered horse or a couture-brand logo that communicates its worth to viewers. Attitudes serving a social-adjustive function promote the capability to connect with appropriate social group members or to impress attractive others. Snyder and DeBono (1985)

Value-expressive attitudes

Perhaps the most difficult to conceptualize and affect, value-expressive functions assist in the outward expression of innate <a href="values">values</a>. Some attitudes are meaningful to a person because they articulate beliefs that are intrinsic to that person’s self-concept (i.e. their ideas about who they are). The attitude is, consequently, ‘part of who they are’ and the expression of that attitude communicates important things about that person to others (Carpenter et al., 2013). Hullett (2002) used value-relevance as an indication of the perceived utility of an attitude to achieve a desired end-state. It is a direct measure of the relationship between a value and an attitude, rather than a measure of the expression of attitudes that are linked to personal values. Concentrating on value-expressive communication of an attitude rather than value-relevance allows communication behavior to take center stage in considering the relationship between values, attitudes, and behaviors (Carpenter et al., 2013). Value-expressive attitudes serve no direct outward purpose, and can be best understood as existing to satisfy an individual’s need to feel unique and true-to-self. Individuals with value-expressive attitudes aren’t concerned with much other than being true to themselves (Carpenter et al., 2013). Product-wise, a concert T-shirt that was passed down from father to son due to their shared value of the musical stylings of that artist would be value-expressive in that the son feels the T-shirt, no matter how dingy, is an extension of his true self. 

Ego-defensive attitudes

<a href="Ego%20defense">Ego-defensive</a> functions serve to protect the individual from both internal and external unpleasantness. Ego-defensive attitudes allow people to avoid accepting unpalatable or objectionable aspects of self or of the external world. Ego-defensive attitudes can advocate conserving one’s own self-esteem. An ego-defensive function, in which one's attitude is held to protect oneself from threatening or undesirable truths (Bazzini & Shaffer 1995). Threats to self-esteem can include personal failings or poor behavior. Katz (1960) and Shavitt and Nelson (2002) posit that ego-defensive attitudes aid in self-esteem maintenance through multiple processes. Cialdini et al. (1976) propose that a product serving an ego-defensive function would be a T-shirt with the logo of a championship-winning sports team to boost one’s own ego through what they term “basking in reflected glory.” That is, the recognition of a sports team’s greatness serves to boost one’s own self-esteem through general association. 

Knowledge attitudes

The fifth function, that of <a href="knowledge">knowledge</a>, aids individuals in comprehending the world around them. Individuals with a knowledge attitude seek to understand occurrences out of the desire to know, not because it is immediately relevant to their needs, but because they simply want to understand (Carpenter et al., 2013). Attitudes that serve a knowledge function help people gain greater understanding of the structure and operation of their world (Katz, 1960). The world that people inhabit is extremely complex, and that attitudes might facilitate making sense of that world without serving needs other than understanding. Other scholars propose that the knowledge function drives attitudes that serve for no purpose other than learning about the world as an end in itself, predicated on a basic need to know (Locander & Spivey, 1978). Though “product” examples may not be appropriate here, following the theme, a T-shirt could intrigue an individual as to the process by which garments are made, thus serving a function of knowledge.

Contemporary Research.
In 1986 <a href="Gregory%20Herek">Gregory Herek</a> posited that all <a href="attitude%20%28psychology%29">attitude</a>s should be perceived as serving either an <a href="evaluative">evaluative</a> or an <a href="Expressive">expressive</a> function, with all attitudes serving one of these functions to some extent. This “neofunctional” reconceptualization allows for attitudes to then serve multiple functions, which thus allows researchers to measure how much influence each attitude has on function (Carpenter et al., 2013). Herek (1986) also posited that some <a href="Personality%20psychology">personality characteristics</a> may be linked to attitudes serving a specific function. This suggestion has proven to be valid in a multitude of studies that take self-monitoring into account as a predictable personality type in relation to attitude functions (Snyder & DeBono, 1985; Shavitt, 1990; Shavitt & Nelson, 2002). 

Herek’s (1986) neofunctional theory resulted in a boom of development of social influence research relating to FAT. Most of this research has centered around the “matching hypothesis” that stems from the original <a href="Daniel%20Katz%20%28psychologist%29">Katz</a> (1960) study, as it manipulates individuals’ attitudes to determine whether matching product advertising appeals to attitude functions regarding the product. Most this research has shown that matching functional attitudes to messaging regarding the function of a product results in increased persuasive <a href="Salience%20%28communication%29">salience</a> (Shavitt, 1990; Shavitt & Nelson, 2002). Other studies have gone even further in attempting to measure the cognitive processes that underlie individual functional attitudes especially in relation to the <a href="Elaboration%20Likelihood%20Model">Elaboration Likelihood Model</a> (DeBono & Harnish, 1988; Petty & Wegener, 1998), albeit to mixed results showing positive ELM-based processing for <a href="Self-monitoring">high self-monitors</a>, but negative suasory effects in subjects deemed to be low self-monitoring.

Herek’s Neofunctional Approach.
After Katz (1960) and Smith’s (1956) seminal studies, the functional approach to attitudes was effectively abandoned. Citing the lack of <a href="empirical">empirical</a> methodological tests to quantify attitude functions as the main reason for the detriment of functional attitude theory, in 1986 Gregory Herek set out to create a new approach to functional attitude theory (Herek, 1986). Recognizing the validity of both the <a href="Theory%20of%20reasoned%20action">reasoned action</a> (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975, 1980) and the <a href="Symbolic%20communication">symbolic</a> approaches (Kinder & Sears, 1981) to attitudes, Herek proposed that both approaches may be equally appropriate to employ depending on certain person characteristics, attitude domains, or situations (Herek, 1986, 1987). Herek posited that attitudes serve two general purposes: they are either evaluative or expressive. Within evaluative attitudes, Herek proposed three evaluative functions: experiential and specific, experiential and schematic, or anticipatory-evaluative. Likewise, expressive attitudes served three separate functions: social-expressive, value-expressive, or defensive. Herek’s Neofunctional Approach to Attitudes, then, proposed that these different attitudes regarding the same attitude object may form for different purposes in different situations or domains, and, likewise, individuals may hold the same attitudes toward the object, but for a variety of different functions. By allowing for multiple attitudes to be held for different functions, Herek created a <a href="quantitative%20research">quantitative</a> scale that allows for empirical comparison of multiple attitudes regarding the same object (Carpenter, 2013). 

Development

Herek claimed that <a href="Functionalism%20%28psychology%29">functionalism</a> was attractive as an approach to attitude theory because it felt like “common sense” to most people and possessed the potential to integrate other attitude theories such as Ajzen & Fishbein’s (1980) <a href="theory%20of%20reasoned%20action">theory of reasoned action</a>, or Sears et al.’s (1980) symbolic politics (Herek, 1987), but because Smith (1956) and Katz (1960) failed to create accurate and consistent methodologies in their seminal studies, functionalism was never able to get off the ground and develop a comprehensive <a href="theory">theory</a> able to predict conditions under which specific attitude functions would dominate (Herek, 1987). To create an empirical functional theory, Herek first developed two different methodologies to quantify and group different functions of attitudes.

Method One: Content Analysis

Herek set out to determine what functions attitudes mainly served by conducting <a href="Content%20analysis">content analyses</a> of undergraduate student essays describing their feelings about lesbian women and gay men (Herek, 1987). Herek chose the topic because of his belief that it was a controversial enough issue at the time to elicit extreme attitudes both in terms of acceptance and rejection of gay people. Because of the nature of the issue, it was also expected that attitudes reported regarding gays would be deeply-held and would serve a wide-range of functions. Subjects were instructed to begin their essay with “I have generally positive [or negative] attitudes toward lesbians and male homosexuals because…” (Herek, p. 287). Herek and two assistants then categorized the essays by themes, defined as, “any idea or complete thought somehow related to the respondent’s attitudes.” The researchers found twenty-eight recurring themes which they then coded every essay for, parsing categories as necessary. After the preliminary study, which evaluated 110 essays, a new sample of 248 students from the same university wrote attitude essays on the same topic of gays and lesbians. The new sample also completed questionnaires that collected <a href="demographic">demographic</a> data and were also used to select students who reported exclusively heterosexual behaviors. A total of 205 of this new sample qualified for <a href="coding%20%28social%20sciences%29">coding</a> based on the presence or absence of the 28 themes previously found. Using block cluster analysis, the researchers identified patterns of multiple themes within essays, which were interpreted to indicate the presence of function(s). Block cluster analysis resulted in five interpretable clusters of themes which were then refined per the theoretical perspectives of Smith et al. (1956) and Katz (1960). This refinement resulted in two patterns of themes containing positive attitudes (experiential-schematic: positive, self-expressive: positive), and three patterns containing negative attitudes (experiential-schematic: negative, self-expressive: negative, and defensive). 

Method Two: Attitude Functions Inventory

Recognizing that content analysis can be a time-consuming procedure, Herek also developed an objective inventory for attitude functions based on the sentence “My opinions about [target] mainly are based on…” with different completions for the sentence based on the four functions: experiential-schematic, defensive, value-expressive, and social-expressive (Herek, 1987). Sixty-nine subjects completed four variations of the AFI, the first of which was a follow-up to the original content analysis assessing the attitudes toward lesbians and gays, and the other three examining attitudes toward persons with AIDS, cancer, or mental illness, respectively. Using a <a href="Likert%20scale">Likert scale</a>, respondents rated AFI statements on a scale ranging from ‘not at all,’ ‘true of me,’ or ‘very true of me.’ Additionally, respondents completed three attitude-related personality measures: the Defense Mechanisms Inventory, the <a href="Self-consciousness">Self-Consciousness</a> Scale, and the <a href="Self-monitoring">Self-Monitoring</a> Scale. Using the results of the personality tests, Herek successfully predicted where certain personalities would fall on the AFI, with all personalities falling somewhere on the scale. 

Neofunctional Attitude Functions.
Evaluative Functions 

The source benefit of evaluative functions is associated with rewards and punishments from the attitude object itself. This means that when a functionally evaluative attitude is held, attitude objects are treated as ends in themselves as individuals perceive their association between either reward or punishment. <a href="Positive%20mental%20attitude">Positive attitudes</a> will arise toward an object when the individual perceives it as a source of utility or pleasure while negative attitudes are a result of direct past, or anticipated future, unpleasant experiences with the object. In line with the original posits of both Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956), neofunctional evaluative attitudes allow people to organize their reality according to both <a href="self-interest">self-interest</a> and <a href="predictability">predictability</a>. Herek specified three individual evaluative functions:

Experiential-Specific
Experiential-Schematic
Anticipatory-Evaluative
Expressive Functions

Within <a href="Emotional%20expression">expressive</a> functions of attitude, the attitude object is a means to an end. Attitude objects of expressive attitudes are used as vehicles to assure social status, boost <a href="self-esteem">self-esteem</a>, and/or reduce <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a>. While expressive functions serve some sense of utility, the effects are not as apparent, and are often intrinsic rewards rather than the extrinsic utility seen with evaluative functions.

Social-Expressive 
Value-Expressive
Defensive 

Sources of Attitude Functions.
Herek believed one of the downfalls of Katz and Smith et al. (1956) was their direct comparison of <a href="personality%20traits">personality traits</a>, which are relatively stable, to attitude functions, which studies show to fluctuate from person-to-person or situation-to-situation (Herek, 1986). Recognizing that individuals’ psychological predispositions to functions varied, and that individuals often expressed the same attitude for different reasons or attitudes about separate objects for the same reason, Herek proposed three sources of attitude functions that attitudes could vary across. These sources can aid in the prediction and influence of <a href="behavior">behavior</a> when it can be determined from which source an individual will root their attitude. 

Person Characteristics

Herek defines person characteristics as “relatively stable <a href="psychological%20needs">psychological needs</a>, <a href="values">values</a>, and orientations toward the world” (Herek, 1986). Through the content analysis and AFI, Herek found that individuals with experiential-schematic attitudes scored higher on the self-monitoring test, theorizing that experiential-schematic intergroup individuals are more sensitive to their surroundings as well as their own values. Herek also showed that persons who operate mainly on evaluative functions show strong concerns for their own well-being. Alternatively, social-expressive attitudes were found most amongst individuals who exhibited a high <a href="need%20for%20affiliation">need for affiliation</a> as well high self-presentation awareness (Snyder & DeBono, 1985). Ultimately, personality is a weak means for social influence as personality is typically stable across individuals. 

Domain Characteristics

Herek defined domain characteristics as “groups, objects, issues, or behaviors toward which people hold attitudes” (1986). Individual domains can include a multitude of different attitudes. For instance, in Herek’s methodology development attitudes were examined within the domain of attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Within this domain is contained attitudes toward people with <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a>, attitudes toward government-funding of anti-AIDS programming, attitudes toward AIDS fundraisers, etc. Broad domains like AIDS or politics likely contain all variations of attitude functions across a population, but more narrow domains, such as consumer products, are less likely to elicit an array of attitudes as individuals tend to view this type of domain from an evaluative perspective.

Situational Characteristics

Situations are defined by Herek as “relatively transient social episodes,” and include the setting, actors, and context of the episode. In situations where an individual recognizes specific personal goals, evaluative attitudes are more likely to develop. Past experiences with attitude objects, as necessary in experiential-specific and schematic attitudes, will stimulate memories of past situations involving the attitude object, which will then determine the <a href="Valence%20%28psychology%29">valence</a> of attitude held by the individual. Alternatively, in situations that highlight identity needs, such as a political debate, individuals are more likely to employ an expressive attitude.

Critique.
While FAT has proven extremely valuable in predicting increased <a href="Social%20influence">influence</a> through functional matching through an array of empirical studies, explanations for why this effect is present have yet to materialize. Lavine and Snyder (1996) posited that the matching effect could be attributed to <a href="bias">bias</a>ed processing of messages that are functionally linked, with individuals processing functionally-matched messages peripherally (ELM) or <a href="heuristically">heuristically</a> (<a href="Heuristic-systematic%20model%20of%20information%20processing">HSM</a>). However, research based on the ELM has provided mixed results and many studies have failed in their attempts to replicate original results and thus theories other than ELM are necessary to understand the function matching phenomenon (Carpenter et al., 2013). 

Additionally, FAT as a field of research is very messy in its theoretical models of application insofar as studies have not relied on one concrete definition of functional attitudes. From the theory’s beginnings, Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956) conceptualized similar-yet-different functions, Herek’s (1986) neofunctional theory further parsed these functions, and later research by Snyder and DeBono (1985) added the personality variables of high v. low self-monitors into FAT. This is not to say that any of their research was invalidated by these additions or differences, but only to note that the theory could benefit from a set of unitary applicable definitions and functions.

Benefits and Practical Application.
FAT is best understood as a foundational approach to <a href="social%20influence">social influence</a> upon which other models or processes may be applied. It is incredibly useful in that it can be easily understood and applied to real-life situations, allowing social influencers to predict the <a href="persuasive">persuasive</a> appeal that would best match their audience’s functional attitude toward a product or idea. Ample lab research has categorically proven that matching attitude functions to appeals improves the salience of persuasive arguments, especially regarding advertisements (Shavitt & Nelson, 2002; Carpenter et al., 2013). This matching effect can also be exploited in interpersonal social influence situations and professions such as courtroom arguments or governmental lobbying. 

Anecdotal Application.
Generally, <a href="democracy">democratic</a> governmental systems are understood to operate in a utilitarian fashion in that the most preferred candidate is elected by the masses, and is then expected to act on legislation in a manner that induces maximum benefit to their constituents. While it is mainly true that politicians act to increase utility for their constituents, there is also an individual attitudinal side to every politician that, according to FAT, can be understood to serve any of a variety of functions, and can thus be manipulated and matched to arguments in support of or against certain bills. That is, if a <a href="lobbyist">lobbyist</a> can understand the attitude functions of legislation in regard to a particular politician, then that lobbyist can also predict which attitude function to match to their persuasive appeal. 

Future Applications.
Perhaps the most economically promising theoretical application of FAT lies in the future of online <a href="Targeting%20%28advertising%29">ad targeting</a>. Lab research on personality regarding attitude functions has had to rely on self-reporting or surveys to determine high v. low self-monitoring or expressive v. evaluative personality types. As technology improves, the ability to determine personality types and attitude functions, as well as the consumer behaviors associated with these factors, may soon become <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>ic. Meta-analyses of IP <a href="datamining">datamining</a> such as search history and browsing habits, combined with knowledge of <a href="consumer%20behavior">consumer behavior</a> obtained through records that pre-date the internet could lead to electronic profiles of individual consumers to be used by advertisers to hyper-target their audience with ultra-tailored or matched ads. Granted, this type of application would take tremendous levels of coding and analyses, and would still rely on predictions of attitude functions rather than purely empirical data, but at the pace technology is advancing, there is no reason to doubt the possibility of FAT-based targeted advertising in the not-so-distant future.

Summary.
Katz (1960) and Smith et al. (1956) originally set out to discover the purpose of varying attitudes, determining that attitudes exist to serve a variety of functions necessary to individuals’ physical, emotional, and social needs. Their functional attitudes theory sparked a wave of research in the 1980s that was able to consistently empirically link function-matched appeals and arguments to increased persuasion when presented to individuals perceived to be in that attitude function. This matching hypothesis has been replicated, but studies attempting to prove the link behind it have not. While future research is needed to determine the cause of the matching effect, as well as to develop consistent attitude and personality measurements, FAT is a practically applicable theory that allows social influencers to accurately predict what type of functional appeal should be used when persuading an audience about a product or idea.

Gib

A gib or "gib-arm" is the horizontal or near-horizontal beam used in many types of <a href="Crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> to support the load clear of the main support.

Usually gib-arms are attached to a vertical mast or <a href="Tower%23Other%20towers">tower</a> or sometimes to an inclined <a href="wikt%3Aboom%23Noun%202">boom</a>. In other jib-less designs such as <a href="derrick">derrick</a>s, the load is hung directly from a boom which is often anomalously called a jib.

A <a href="Jib%20%28camera%29">camera jib</a> or jib arm in cinematography is a small crane that holds nothing but the camera.

The diminutive form "gibbet" (meaning short <a href="fork">fork</a>ed beam) may be misused to describe an entire <a href="gallows">gallows</a> structure employed in <a href="gibbeting">gibbeting</a> or <a href="hanging">hanging</a>.

Warren Church

Warren Church (born 1929) is an <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="politician">politician</a> who served on the <a href="Monterey%20County%20Board%20of%20Supervisors">Monterey County Board of Supervisors</a> from 1965 to 1977. He is a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> who represented District 1 which at that time encompassed the northern parts of <a href="Monterey%20County%2C%20California">Monterey County</a>. He served on various committees and published books on local history and genealogy. He is a native of Monterey County.

Warren Church has been acknowledged as the father of the Monterey County parks system.

Early life, education.
Warren Church was born in northern Monterey County and has spent all his life in the county, graduating from <a href="King%20City%20High%20School">King City High School</a> in 1947. He was a high school athlete as well as being active with both student government and the school newspaper. At the age of 15, Church worked in the stock room of the King City <a href="J.C.%20Penney">J.C. Penney</a> department store. He graduated from <a href="California%20Polytechnic%20State%20University">California Polytechnic State College</a> in 1962, earning a Bachelor’s Degree in social sciences and a Master of Arts Degree in education-social sciences. He also received both elementary and secondary teaching credentials. Church taught at the <a href="Pajaro%20Valley%20Unified%20School%20District">Pajaro Elementary</a> and the Jefferson school in <a href="San%20Benito%20County%2C%20California">San Benito</a>. In 1974 Church was awarded the Honored Alumni Award by Cal Poly University’s alumni association. In college Church also served on the staff of the college newspaper, “"El Mustang".” Warren Church is a veteran of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and served with the 987th Armored Field Artillery Battalion and was wounded while serving, receiving a <a href="Purple%20Heart">Purple Heart</a>. He was eventually discharged as a Corporal, April 17, 1953.

Board of Supervisors.
Before the primary, Church, Allmond and incumbent Deaver were split over the incorporation of North Monterey County, <a href="Castroville%2C%20California">Castroville</a> and <a href="Moss%20Landing%2C%20California">Moss Landing</a>. Church opposed incorporation of North Monterey County, calling it an "'extremely poor, short sighted and senseless reason,'" but felt that Castroville was ready. Allmond called the incorporation of Castroville a "'stab in the back'" but later changed to asking for more input from the Castroville people. Deaver wanted to take a "'wait and see' attitude."

In the June 1964 primary, Chester Deaver had finished far in front of his challengers; Deaver 2,927, Church 1,374, Allmond 1,116, Simon 938, Bayer 650, Coffill 391 (unoffical results). The runoff of the top two candidates led to the election of Church to the Monterey County Board of Supervisors November 3, 1964, Church defeated incumbent Deaver, "with a 1,066 vote margin". At the time, "The supervisor position was part-time and came with a typewriter and $300 a month for incidentals. 

The 1968 election results were Church 5,555 to Simon 2,859.

In 1972, the "<a href="Salinas%20Californian">Salinas Californian</a>" endorsed Church for Supervisor, while saying that they have disagreed with him many times and probably will continue to do so as "the interests of the city of <a href="Salinas%2C%20California">Salinas</a> seen to be a fairly low priority item with him... Nevertheless... he is head and shoulders above his opponents." Church won reelection for his third term June 6, 1972. He won with 53% of the vote. His challengers were Jack Simon and Andrew Hollenstain. 

In 1972 Church was invited to a Salinas Board of Realtors meeting to discuss campaign issues in a private setting. Church declined stating, 

In November 1972, the Board heard arguments for relaxing zoning ordinances for mobile homes in North Monterey County. Arguments for relaxing were due to very high home prices that made owning a home in the county difficult. Arguments against were that mobile homeowners used the county services equally as a homeowner but paid lower taxes. There was also a concern about a reduction of lot sizes, allowing the county to double in population since 1963 when 11,000 residents lived in the unincorporated area of North County (excluding Castroville). According to the North County Rezoning Study which looked at 48,700 acres and an existing density of 11.3 acres per unit, proposed developments could increase the population from 16,000 (from 1970 census) to 338,900 with a density of .51 acres per unit. Appearance of mobile homes, fire safety, and environmental concerns were also a consideration. Church stated that all attendees at the meeting that approved of the ban lived in North Monterey County, and those arguing about the ban were people who lived outside the area and had a financial interest. One <a href="Pacific%20Grove%2C%20California">Pacific Grove</a> resident, Art Woodfin, complained about the ban stating that he "had an option on 15 acres of land in North County and planned to put mobile homes on it." Church replied, "'Then you're coming to rape the North County?'"

The "Salinas Californian" stated in 1975 that although the "Californian" has criticized Church, "he's given us about as good as he's got in rebuttal... its hard not to admire the man's independence." There was a serious recall effort for Church's seat in 1974 which failed. Despite losing several elections, "Defeat doesn't discourage him... Church doesn't scare worth a darn." In August 1975, Church announced that he would not seek re-election to the Board of Supervisors saying, "'12 years is as long as anyone should consecutively hold any one elective or appointive position... New ideas are necessary for proper functioning of government.'" He hinted that he might run for the State Senate seat that was being vacated by Republican Donald Grunsky. 

Church had a perfect meeting attendance record. In the 12 years of Church's tenure, he did not miss a single board meeting. Church remembers at his farewell Supervisor meeting that he "attended 558 consecutive regular board meetings and 100 or more special meetings." Reflecting on needs of the county for his successor, Church said that "growth and property taxes... the two major problems facing Monterey County... prohibit general use of the property tax and adopt low density zoning... we don't have to become South San Jose." Further about his tenure with the Board, Church reflected, "I see no basis to bring suit against the county, except perhaps for the amount and color of my hair." County Supervisor and future Congressman <a href="Sam%20Farr">Sam Farr</a> in 1976, said of his colleague Church, "'I think this board has really been one of the outstanding supervisorial boards in California ... whose 12 years of experience and insight have taught me a lot. I think that serving in public office is really a leveling experience. I think I've learned that from my colleague on the left (Poyner) and Mr. Church.'"

Parks.
Church was instrumental in the acquisition and development of the Monterey County Parks system. When running for the board position in 1964 his "main plank was a county park system." Prior to 1966, Monterey County did not have a parks department, and was one of the last counties in California to have one. There had been interest in 1944 when the county made a parks plan, but nothing happened. Church blames a '"conservative viewpoint that didn't push for public services.'" for the reason it took until 1966 to give Monterey County its first public park. He spearheaded the purchase of a former turkey ranch, for Royal Oaks Park ($122,000 - it was $1,000 an acre), which opened on Labor Day in 1966 and also saw establishment of the Monterey County Parks Department that same year. His tenure on the Board of Supervisors also saw the creation of a number of other parks including Manzanita Park near <a href="Castroville%2C%20California">Castroville</a>, Toro Park in Salinas, <a href="Jacks%20Peak%20Park">Jacks Peak</a> in Monterey and San Lorenzo Park near <a href="King%20City%2C%20California">King City</a>. 

At the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Monterey County Parks Department, Republican Charmaine Cruchett thanked Church and said, "The little fox I recently saw dashing across Castroville Boulevard into Manzanita Park may not know who provided that haven, but certainly all North Countians should. I thank you Warren. My children thank you. And if we're lucky, our human progeny can share your parks progeny forever." The county administrative office released a memorandum October 2, 2006 at the 40th anniversary of the Parks Department saying, "The highlight of the event was the attendance of Warren Church... who was instrumental in establishing the Parks Department and Charter Park Commissioners, from 1966." In 1977 Church said he had tried to protect 

Civic interests.
In 1975 Church pointed out that there is a relationship between growth and property taxes leading to agricultural land being sold for development. This drives the need for services and thus higher taxes. One outcome was passage in 1976 of a Board of Supervisors resolution to establish "growth guidelines to protect the character of the county." Church felt that rather than using property taxes to support county governments, a percentage of federal or state income tax could be set aside.

Church was a strong supporter of local control and access to the court system and he long resisted the eventual consolidation of Monterey County courts, largely in service to the interests of his constituents.

At the end of his tenure, the "Californian" stated that Church was a strong supporter of the library system and initiated the first family planning program in Monterey County.

Church was also a founder of Post 593 of the <a href="Prunedale%2C%20California">Prunedale</a> <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a>.

Humble Oil.
Church was a key vote on a controversial 1965 project promoted by Humble Oil, a subsidiary of <a href="Standard%20Oil">Standard Oil</a>, that would have changed Monterey County's look and feel. The company wanted to build a 400(+) acre oil refinery on the wetlands near <a href="Moss%20Landing%2C%20California">Moss Landing</a>. Monterey County was deeply divided on the plan. The Board of Supervisors, after a marathon public meeting, voted 3-2 to back the plan, with Church in favor of it because his district overwhelmingly backed the plan. But Church and others added many tough restrictions to the project. Public outcry and engineering problems also discouraged Humble Oil, and they eventually pulled out of Monterey County and decided to build a bigger refinery up north in more-welcoming <a href="Benicia%2C%20California">Benicia</a>. "It is not just the Humble Oil refinery we are fighting at Moss Landing," said <a href="Carmel%20Highlands%2C%20California">Carmel Highlands</a> photographer <a href="Ansel%20Adams">Ansel Adams</a> prior to the decision. "It is the whole industrial complex which will inevitability follow and change the whole complexion of this Monterey County."

The Humble project was approved, but the planning commission (which had previously rejected the project by a 5-4 vote) had imposed 36 conditions. Church added three more which included for parking, <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> recovery and <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> emissions. As a part of the imposed conditions on the approval for Humble Oil, Church asked that three air-pollution stations be set up in Monterey County to monitor air quality for two-years prior to Humble starting to build. Church said that the county needed to do so in order to "obtain 'guidelines' to determine what pollutants an oil refinery may contribute." Church's intentions were that Humble be required to pay for and maintain the stations. 


Personal life.
Church has had a number of business ventures, including <a href="beekeeping">beekeeping</a> in high school and college, nursery supply and <a href="Christmas%20tree%20cultivation">Christmas Tree farms</a>. He has grown Christmas trees in properties in Hidden Valley, at Omo Ranch, CA., Egremont, Ma., and Wadena, Mn.

Seoullo 7017

Seoullo 7017, also known as the Seoul Skygarden or Skypark, is a <a href="elevated%20park">elevated</a>, <a href="linear%20park">linear park</a> in <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a>, built atop a former highway overpass. The path, which is about one kilometer in length and lined with 24,000 plants, is similar to New York City's <a href="High%20Line">High Line</a>. Skygarden was designed by <a href="MVRDV">MVRDV</a>, a Dutch firm, and opened in May 2017. In the future, the park may become an urban <a href="plant%20nursery">nursery</a>, growing trees and plants for replanting elsewhere in the city. The path also improves walking times around the city's Central Station.

The disused overpass closed in 2015 and cuts diagonally across <a href="Seoul%20Station">Seoul Station</a> at 17m above street level. The '70' in the name comes from the year 1970 when the flyover was dedicated, while the '17' is both the number of walkways connected to it, and the year 2017. The park includes gardens, terraces, and exhibitions, and will "feature over 24,085 plants representing 228 species of trees, shrubs and flowers found in and outside Korea."

History.
In the 1960s, a decade after the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, Seoul planners "ordered the construction of dozens of elevated highways to keep traffic flowing through the capital. Fast forward a few decades, and these hulking overpasses became not only a blight on the landscape, but also a safety risk." As the overpasses were gradually removed, city planners decided to re-purpose some as pedestrian green spaces in the crowded urban city. Seoul mayor <a href="Park%20Won-soon">Park Won Soon</a> pushed for the US $52 million skypark to be completed as a complement to Seoul's <a href="Cheonggyecheon">Cheonggyecheon</a> river restoration project, organized under previous mayor <a href="Lee%20Myung-bak">Lee Myung Bak</a>.

The park's plans faced early controversy over fears of traffic congestion and concerns from market owners in nearby <a href="Namdaemun%20Market">Namdaemun.</a> While some local press was supportive, other media outlets dismissed it as a mayoral "vanity project."

Location.
The Skypark begins at <a href="Malli-dong">Malli-dong</a> and continues northeast past Seoul Station, ending 1,024 meters later near <a href="Namdaemun">Namdemun</a> at <a href="Hoehyeon%20Station">Hoehyeon Station</a>.

History.
Nonconformist preaching began in this part of <a href="Caernarvonshire">Caernarvonshire</a> in the 1740s. In 1770, a Mrs Edwards of the Nanhoron estate donated land for the construction of a chapel. The chapel was completed in 1772, making it "probably the earliest surviving nonconformist building in North Wales". Restorations took place in the early 19th century and again in 1956-58. By the late 19th century the chapel had been abandoned and, no longer in use as a place of worship, it is in the care of the Capel Newydd Nanhoron Trust.

Virtual reality in primary education

Virtual reality is a computer application which allows users to experience immersive, three dimensional visual and audio simulations. According to Pinho (2004), Virtual Reality is characterized by its immersion in the 3D world, interaction with virtual objects, and involvement in exploring the virtual environment. These different facets of virtual reality have many applications within the primary education (K - 8th) sphere in enhancing student learning, increasing engagement, and creating new opportunities for addressing learning preferences.

General education.
VR (<a href="Virtual%20reality">Virtual reality</a>) can be utilized numerous ways in an educational setting.

Augmenting reality.
Providing children with a way to immerse themselves into a context or situation can increase their understanding and provide a new perspective. In one study, Antonietti et al. (2000) found that giving children an in-depth virtual tour of a painting and letting them examine all aspects of the painting helped with their description and interpretation of the painting when compared to a control group that studied the painting without the usage of VR. Additionally, augmented reality books have been developed in order to provide a 3D rendition of the book, providing students with a different more synergetic way of learning. The Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology has launched a geology textbook which allows students to learn traditional information while virtually interacting with the different layers in the earth’s core.

Virtual field trips.
Other applications within a general education setting include Virtual Field Trips programs like nearpod and google expeditions. In virtual field trips, students visit real world places or educational simulations to experience different lessons. For example, <a href="https%3A//edu.google.com/expeditions/">Google Expeditions</a> allows students to take a shared field trip using smartphone headset technology under the control of a teacher’s app. Nearpod’s VR provides lesson plans in all core subjects for primary grades, and has been shown to increase student engagement in lessons.

Individualized learning.
Although it can be used cooperatively, learning has been shown to be especially effective when VR is utilized for independent learning. Merchant et al. (2014), found that “students performed [significantly] better when they worked individually rather than collaboratively when learning through [VR based collaborative learning environments]”. Some VR applications provide independent learning opportunities when combined with individual lesson plans. For example, students might fill out a worksheet in correspondence with a specific virtual reality simulation.

Social skills and collaboration.
Virtual Reality (VR) also has uses within primary education for social-emotional development.

Collaboration.
VR has applications for development of social skills and multi-user cooperation. VR can provide opportunities for students to collaborate through cooperative simulations, and has been shown to support introverted students in their group interactions. One study found VR based collaboration to create "superior collaboration and interaction in the development of outcomes, as compared with other situations where group structures were used. " 

Autism.
VR simulations have been shown to help children with Autism by providing a virtual world in which they can learn to handle real life scenarios within safe and controlled virtual environments. A study by Strickland et al. (2007) found that children with autism could successfully use virtual worlds to learn skills in fire and street safety, and can apply those skills to real life situations.

Business and academic reception.
The use of virtual reality in <a href="primary%20education">primary education</a> has been supported by grants from foundations and venture capital firms. The <a href="IEEE">IEEE</a> has held workshops on "K-12 Embodied Learning through Virtual & Augmented Reality (KELVAR)" in 2016 and 2017.

Despite the interest in virtual reality for K-12 education within business and academia, skepticism of its usefulness for K-12 learners has also been expressed. A 2009 review of the literature concluded that only the most independent, intrinsically motivated, and highly skilled K-12 students succeeded with VR. This review traced the problem to a lack of experience with gearing virtual reality to K-12 specifically; most of the experience had been with VR software designed for adults.

Harry Gill (cox)

Henry Morgan Abbot Gill, (born 20 January 2000) is an Australian born school boy cox and winner of the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley in 2017 for Scotch College. He is now referred to as one of the greatest school boy coxes of all time.

Early Life.
Gill grew up in Hawthorn with his parents and three brothers. He is known to like reading books and playing chess in his spare time.

School Life.
Gill currently attends Scotch College, Melbourne and is in grade 11. Since winning the Henley regatta, Gill's arrogance around the school grounds has increased dramatically and now refers to himself as one of the "big dogs" of the school community.

Rowing career.
In 2012, Gill started his coxing career at Scotch College, Melbourne with year 9 students. 
In October 2016, Gill was promoted to the first VIII crew at Scotch College, Melbourne.
In March 2017, Gill and his Scotch crew won the APS schoolboys Head of the River.
In 2017 Gill coxed his crew to win the Schoolboy National Championships in Sydney Australia. 
In July 2017 Gill won the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at Henley for Scotch College and became the first school from Melbourne, Australia to win the event. After facing strong competition from the British crews of St Paul's School, Eton College and then, in the final, Radley College, the Scotch College first eight emerged triumphant.

Poverty in Afghanistan

<a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> is one amongst the poorest countries in the world. In Aghanistan, poverty is widespread in rural and urban areas. However, it has been estimated that poverty in Afghanistan is mainly concentrated in rural areas. It has been estimated that four out of five poor people live in rural areas. The regions in Afghanistan where almost half of the inhabitants are poor are the East, Northeast, and West-Central regions. According to the Afghan government's estimates, 42 per cent of the Afghanistan's total population lives below the poverty line. Also, 20 percent of people living just above the poverty line are highly vulnerable to falling into poverty. 
Reports.
The Afghanistan Poverty Status Update was jointly produced by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s Ministry of Economy and the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>. It used the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) data and according to itsassesment 36% of Afghan population remained poor in 2007-08 and in 2012. This meant that more than one in three Afghans did not have enough money to buy food or fulfill their basic needs. This was even puzzling as the GDP growth rate during the same period was 6.9%. 
Poverty Alleviation.
Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS).
The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) 2008-2013 served as Afghanistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and used the Afghanistan Compact (2006) as a foundation. The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) was launched to serve as the country’s poverty reduction strategy. It identifies factors which contribute to poverty such as lack of infrastructure, limited access to markets, social inequity, historical and ongoing conflict, and various productivity constraints.

<doc id="54889583" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54889583" title="Rhythm interpretation">
Rhythm interpretation

Rhythm interpretation is an important part of healthcare in EMS. Trained medical personnel can determine different treatment options based on the cardiac rhythm of a patient. There are many common heart rhythms that are part of a few different categories, sinus arrhythmia, atrial arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmia. Rhythms can be evaluated by measuring a few key components of a rhythm strip, the PQRST sequence, which represents one cardiac cycle, the ventricular rate, which is the rate at which the ventricles contract, and the atrial rate, which is the rate at which the atria contract.

PQRST SEQUENCE 

The 5 deviations from the base line on a rhythm strip make up the PQRST sequence. There are a few key intervals that must be measured for proper analysis of a heart rhythm, The PR interval is the interval between the end of the P wave and the beginning of the Q wave. This represents the conduction of the atria of the heart, the speed at which they are able to conduct an electrical impulse. The QRS complex represents the conduction of the ventricles of the heart, the speed at which they are able to conduct an electrical impulse. The interval between each R wave represents the heart rate, which is critical for determining different rhythms within the defined categories.

Sinus Arrhythmias

There are 6 different sinus arrhythmia. 

A normal heart should have a normal sinus rhythm, this rhythm can be identified by a ventricular rate of 60-100 bpm, at a regular rate, with a normal PR interval (0.12 to 0.20 second) and a normal QRS complex (0.12 second and less).

Sinus bradycardia is another regular rhythm however the ventricular rate is only between 40-60 bpm, with a normal PR interval and a normal QRS complex.

Sinus tachycardia is another regular rhythm however the ventricular rate is quicker, between 100 - 160 bpm, with a normal PR interval and normal QRS complex.

Sinus arrhythmia is an irregular rhythm with a ventricular rate of 60 - 100 normally, however a slow rhythm can be distinguished when the rate is less than 60, the PR interval and QRS complex are normal.

Sinus pause is a regular rhythm however a sudden pause occurs in the rhythm which makes it miss a few beats, if the rhythm resumes on time after the pause then this is known as a sinus block, if the rhythm does not resume on time after the pause this is known as a sinus arrest.

Atrial ArrhythmiasThere are 5 different atrial arrhythmias.

A wondering atrial pace maker can be either normal or irregular in rate, much like a sinus arrhythmia the rate is normally between 60 - 100 bpm when it is normal and less than 60 when it is slow, the distinguishing feature of this rhythm is a p wave that varies in size, shape, and direction, the PR interval can wither be normal or irregular depending on the location of conduction of the PR interval, the QRS complex is normal.

A premature atrial pacemaker has a regular underlying rhythm however there is a premature beat which can be identified by an irregular p wave with a different size, shape, and direction often found within a T wave, the PR interval is generally normal however can be hard to measure, the QRS complex is premature for the PAC, but is generally normal.

Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia has a regular rate, however a high rate of about 140-250 bpm, p waves are generally hidden and the PR interval is not measurable.

Atrial Flutter has an atrial rate of 250-400 and can be identified by p waves with saw tooth deflections.

Atrial fibrillation has an atrial rate of 400+ and is distinguishable die to its irregular ventricular rate and wavy deflections.

Ventricular Arrhythmias

Ventricular arrhythmias are some of the most dangerous heart rhythms requiring CPR and defibrillation in cases of symptomatic Ventricular tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation.

There are 5 different ventricular arrhymia.

Ventricular Tachycardia is a regular rhythm with a rate of 140-250 bpm, there are no P waves and the main feature is a wide QRS complex (0.12 and greater)

Ventricular Fibrillation has no p waves or QRS complexes, there are only wavy irregular deflections throughout the heart rhythm, at this point the heart would have a rate of 0 and be supplying no blood through the body.

Idioventricular rhythm this is a regular rhythm identifiable by a wide QRS complex with absent P waves, and a rate between 30-40 bpm.

An Accelerated IVR is also a regular rhythm with a wide QRS complex and absent P waves, however the rate is between 50-100 bpm.

The final rhythm is Ventricular Standstill this rhythm will appear as a flat line, but may have a few non conducted p waves, the heart rate of this will be 0 and be supplying no blood through the body like ventricular fibrillation.

In the event that he would not return alive, Guillaume introduced his son Robert to his loyal barons to receive the ducal throne heritage.

We then have an extensive flashback. Williams's father <a href="Robert%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke Robert</a> declares William his heir before departing for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The barons swear loyalty. But Robert dies and William, still a child, has to flee.

We then see a long sequence with William as a fugitive. Finally as a young man, her persuades the King of France to lend him an army. He wins a crucial battle and becomes Duke.

During the 1066 sections of the film, William tells a friend that it isn’t the weather that is delaying him. And at the end, he gets a messenger from Norway.

Reception.
"In Deep" received universally good reviews.

In <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a>, John Kelman wrote "The line-up may suggest mainstream, but this is no straight-ahead session...As impressive as Lockheart was on Moving Air, his playing has become even more muscular, combining the late Michael Brecker's visceral power with his own kind of tension-and-release." The Yorkshire Post wrote "Lockheart's work nods to Coltrane and Michael Brecker, but he's firmly his own man." Ray Comiskey in the Irish Times drew attention to Lockheart's skills in utilising the talents of his band "Lockheart’s voicings (using some brass overdubbing) have a fine appreciation of the tonal qualities the players bring to the table". Ian Mann said the album was a "strong candidate for Lockheart's best work to date".Lockheart was interviewed in <a href="Jazzwise">Jazzwise</a> in June 2009. He explained that the title of the album desceribed how improvising is about connecting with another musician at a very deep level.

Hwang Byungsng

Hwang Byungsng (born 1970) is a South Korean poet. He studied creative writing at the Seoul Institute of the Arts and Chugye University for the Arts. He finished coursework in creative writing at Myongji Graduate School. Hwang is considered to have made a radical break from the lyric poetry tradition and introduced queer imagination, subcultural thinking, and stateless language to South Korean literature through the genderqueer voice of multisexual subjects.

Life.
Hwang Byungsng was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1970. He received a degree in creative writing at both the Seoul Institute of the Arts and Chugye University for the Arts. He finished masters-level coursework in creative writing at Myongji Graduate School. In 2003, ""Juchiui h"" (주치의h Primary Doctor h) and five other poems were published in "Para 21", marking his literary debut. He has published three poetry collections to date: "Yeojangnamja Sikoku" (여장남자 시코쿠 Sikoku, the Man Dressed as Woman) (2005); "Teuraekgwa deulpanui byeol" (트랙과 들판의 별 Tracks and Stars in the Field) (2007); and "Yukchaeshowa jeonjip" (육체쇼와 전집 Body Show and Complete Works) (2013). In 2012, his work appeared in a special issue featuring Korean poetry ("Po&sie-Corée’") by the French poetry magazine "Po&sie". He won the 11th Park In-Hwan Literary Award in 2010 and the 13th Midang Literary Award in 2013.

Writing.
Hwang Byungsng's first poetry collection "Yeojangnamja Sikoku" (여장남자 시코쿠 Sikoku, the Man Dressed as Woman) was one of the most widely discussed books in South Korean literary circles during the 2000s. The collection was noted for its open display of desire and impulse, and for its abstract portrayal of objects and spaces. His poetic diction and voice were also very different from conventional Korean poetry. Critics would later describe him as "carrying out, through the play of signifiers, the near impossible work of restoring the world we lost to its original form" (Gwon Hyeok-ung) or as "a powerful detonator that will blow up the ideology of authenticity in modern Korean poetry and its tedious standards" (Lee Gwang-ho). On the other hand, Hwang has been criticized for using "language that does not communicate" and writing "incomprehensible poetry." As mixed opinions of his work continued to build, he became one of the most talked about poets in the 2000s.

As its title suggests, Hwang's first poetry collection explores queer themes and divided subjects by bringing to the forefront the "man dressed as a woman," a character of no clear gender. His second poetry collection "Teuraekgwa deulpanui byeo"l (트랙과 들판의 별 Tracks and Stars in the Field) portrays the wanderings, rebellions, and romances of children who failed to grow up. In this sense, the collection takes readers to a strange fairy-tale world that defies the existing, adult world. Hwang uses a collage of imagery and juxtaposes various stories to powerful effect. Told in a unique format, the stories are ultimately a vast, ironical criticism of the real world at large. Hwang's third poetry collection "Yukchaeshowa jeonjip" (육체쇼와 전집 Body Show and Complete Works) sharply ridicules the existing social order, focusing on the idea of failure.

He was electrifying to watch, and provided an ideal focal point as the rest of the band, heads bowed, cycled through an hour of trance-inducing ritual psychosis.

The principal target of the late government under <a href="Heydar%20Aliyev">Heydar Aliyev</a> was to establish and strengthen the military infrastructure.

History.
Azerbaijan gained independence in 1991, when it was already in the state of war with Armenia. The first national military of independent Azerbaijan including an army, navy, and air force was formed in the same year.

<a href="Ministry%20of%20Defense%20of%20Azerbaijan">The Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan</a> was established on September 5, 1991. In this year the system of the army structure and first brigades were created, and forming process of national staff for the military forces has been started.

The first steps in modernizing the armed forces were made in Azerbaijan, with improvements in weapons and techniques, and the upgrading of the army’s armored cars. Azerbaijan began choosing strategic allies and establishing priorities for national security.

In July 1992, Azerbaijan approved the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe by which limits on conventional military equipment were created. 

After being elected the President of Azerbaijan in 1993, the government of Heydar Aliyev started to create a single army. In November 1993, Azerbaijani parliament passed the Law on Defense. After signing ceasefire with Armenia in 1994, the country gained opportunities to conduct reforms in the Armed Forces. Constructive work and structural reforms carried out in the Armed Forces led to the planning of battle-related objectives under centralized management, management of the military divisions according to the requirements of proper military science, and improvement of the personnel.

The military hardware of Azerbaijan consists of more than 300 main battle tanks, 595 armored combat vehicles and 270 artillery systems Air forces has 106 aircraft and 35 helicopters.

Military industry.
After long years of buying all military facilities from other countries, in early 2000s, Azerbaijan decided to produce its own military equipment and machines. For this purpose, the Ministry of Defense Industry of Azerbaijan was founded on December 16, 2005 by presidential decree.

Around 130 defense goods produced in Azerbaijan, in particular, Gurza patrol vehicles, 7.62 х 54 millimeter Gurza and Shimshek-10 machine guns, 7.62 х 51 millimeter Yalguzag, Istiglal-1T and Mubariz sniper rifles, 7.62 х 54 millimeter attack machine guns of HP-7.62 type. The produced weaponry meets NATO standards.

Azerbaijan cooperates with <a href="Israeli">Israeli</a> defense firms and two Turkish companies on the production of an armored vehicle based on the Russian T-55 tank’s chassis. Azerbaijan also manufactures Israeli-designed spy planes including the licensed pilotless spy plane the Orbiter-2M and the Aerostar. Both are manufactured at the Azad Systems Company plant near Baku. 

Military academies.

Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley

Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley (born February 1980 and September 1985 respectively) are English food writers and media personalities who have been closely associated with the <a href="clean%20eating">clean eating</a> and "wellness" movement. Their first book, "The Art of Eating Well" (2014) spawned a television series on Britain's Channel 4 titled "Eating Well with Hemsley + Hemsley".

Early life.
Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley are sisters born in London in February 1980 and September 1985 respectively to Evangelina who was born in the Philippines and worked in software management, and Jack Hemsley, a lieutenant colonel in the British Army Light Infantry (died 2014). They grew up in service accommodation on army bases in England and Germany.

Career.
Jasmine worked as a model after leaving school, bringing her own food to shoots from which she developed a food-delivery service that Melissa joined. In 2012 they began a recipe blog on the "<a href="Vogue%20%28British%20magazine%29">Vogue</a>" website. Their first book, "The Art of Eating Well", was published in 2014 after which they had a television series on <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> titled "Eating Well with Hemsley + Hemsley". Their second book was "Good + Simple" (2014).

Along with <a href="Natasha%20Corrett">Natasha Corrett</a> and <a href="Ella%20Woodward">Ella Woodward</a>, they have been closely associated with the clean eating and "wellness" movement, but say they have never mentioned clean eating in their books. They say they offer a "simple, healthy approach to life that stretches beyond the kitchen" and use recipes without gluten, grain, or refined sugar. Neither sister is a qualified nutritionist. Their approach has been criticised however as a form of "wellness evangelism" that may not confer the health benefits it promises.

Agnes Wood

Agnes Rosetta "Nessa" Wood (née Eady, 26 May 1921 – 12 December 2013) was a New Zealand artist and writer. She is known for her research and writing on the life of fellow New Zealand artist <a href="Colin%20McCahon">Colin McCahon</a>.

Early life and family.
Born Agnes Rosetta Eady on 26 May 1921, Wood was the daughter of <a href="Lewis%20Alfred%20Eady">Lewis Alfred Eady</a>, a music retailer, and Agnes Amelia Eady (née Adams). On 2 December 1944, she married Edward Phillip Wood at the Congregational Church in Beresford Street, <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>.

Career.

Han Yujoo

Han Yujoo is a South Korean writer (born 1982). Her novels portray not so much the fate of people embroiled in some kind of conflict as their psychological state when they contemplate a situation or idea. She focuses on recording spontaneous thoughts or flashbacks, rather than on describing something accurately or developing a <a href="Dramatic%20structure">dramatic arc</a>. In this absence of a clear plot, the reading experience consists mostly of following the author’s thought process. This is why Han’s work can be considered an example of the French <a href="nouveau%20roman">nouveau roman</a> or <a href="antinovel">antinovel</a>.

Life.
Han Yujoo was born in 1982 in Seoul, South Korea. After graduating Dongdaejeon High School, she studied German language and literature at <a href="Hongik%20University">Hongik University</a> and completed graduate-level coursework in Aesthetics at <a href="Seoul%20National%20University">Seoul National University</a>.

She began her writing career almost by chance. In her final year of high school, she submitted three or four applications to undergraduate programs, including Russian literature, that she supposed would allow her to read as much as possible. She finally chose to enroll in a German literature program. She read extensively, as she had expected, and her university life remained largely uneventful until she took an elective course in creative writing offered by the Korean literature department at her school. Without harboring literary ambitions anywhere as strong as the creative writing majors in her class, she wrote a short story entitled “"Dalo"” (달로 To the Moon) for her final project. She showed the story to a friend interested in literature, who encouraged her to send in the story to writing contests. She submitted it to a contest held by the literary journal "Literature and Society" and won, which officially marked her literary debut. She pursued her master's degree in her mid-twenties, during which she stayed in Paris for around five months.

Currently, she writes, translates, and teaches at a university. She is a member of Ru, an experimental writers’ association, and is the founder of the publisher Oulipopress. She was briefly a member of the band The Chop, along with poets Kiwan Sung and <a href="Hwang%20Byungsng">Hwang Byungsng</a>. In an interview at the 2016 Seoul International Writers’ Festival, Han stated that her involvement with the band was so long ago she barely remembered it, and that she only participated in two shows. She did recall bringing an instrument she was not yet familiar with and performing poorly, having only agreed to perform because a literary colleague had reached out to her in need of a session musician.

In 2008 and 2012, she was funded by <a href="Literature%20Translation%20Institute%20of%20Korea">LTI Korea</a> to partake in the Overseas Residency Program for Korean Writers in New York and <a href="Provence">Provence</a>, respectively. In 2013, she joined the Artience Residency offered by Arts Council Korea.

Writing.
Unlike some writers who receive critical and popular acclaim due to their exceptional narrative or character development, Han Yujoo intentionally veers away from standard practices in fiction writing and succeeds in creating a unique literary voice. Her work holds appeal for some readers and critics because she refuses to craft a meticulously structured narrative and does not attempt to produce memorable scenes through characters or events. In a favorable review of Han’s experimental style, literary critic Hwang Ho-deok writes:

“But can there be a writer who does not want to write? Such a person is probably not a writer at all. Then what about writers who want to write about "not" writing? To tell a story about "not" telling one? There are some, if not many, writers like that right now. They write about action with no action, all the while attempting to erase even that writing itself. They jest that they deny their own being (and their writing); they have decided to become nothing. They are skeptical of the narrative, the message, and even meaning. The ‘first to realize the futility of language,’ they are the ones giving today’s Korean literature a ‘devastating brilliance.’”

Han’s work has also received negative reviews. Some critics argue that her language is superfluous, her experiments derivative, and her works closer to miscellanies of essays rather than novels. It can be argued that Han Yujoo stands on the boundaries of linguistic experimentation that Korean literature is undergoing in the 21st century.

Hannah Amelia Wright

Hannah Amelia Wright (August 18, 1836 - 1924) was a physician, the first female doctor to be appointed examiner in a State asylum.

Early life and family.
Hannah Amelia Wright was born in New York City on August 18, 1836. She was the daughter of Charles Cushing Wright (1796–1854) and Lavinia Delliber Huguenot (died July 6, 1860). Her father was a native of <a href="Damariscotta%2C%20Maine">Damariscotta, Maine</a>. Her mother was born in Charleston, S. C., and was in direct lineal descent from the second settlers of that city, the Huguenots. Charles Cushing Wright was an artist of merit, an engraver, and 17 medals are currently in the permanent collection of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. Charles Cushing Wright has been called “The First American Medalist”; he did his apprenticeship with a silversmith in <a href="Utica%2C%20New%20York">Utica, New York</a>, and then opened Durand and Wright, Engravers, in partnership with <a href="Asher%20Brown%20Durand">Asher Brown Durand</a>. Wright was one of the "First Fifteen" founders of the <a href="National%20Academy%20Museum%20and%20School">National Academy of Design</a>.

Wright received her education at home. Until her thirteenth year she lived in Louisiana, but returned to New York in 1849.

Career.
While still a young girl, Wright decided upon an independent career. Her first effort was in writing fiction. Her stories were published, but, dissatisfied with her work in that line, she turned her attention to the study of music. 

In 1860 Wright obtained a position as teacher of music in the <a href="New%20York%20Institute%20for%20the%20Blind">New York Institute for the Blind</a>. After spending eleven years in teaching in that school, she was preparing to go abroad to pursue the study of music, when she became interested in the care of the insane. She determined to study medicine, with the hope that she might render service to that unfortunate class. 

In 1871 Wright entered the <a href="New%20York%20Medical%20College">New York Medical College for Women</a>, and in 1874 she received the diploma of that institution. Shortly after her graduation, and again some years later, backed by influential friends, Dr. Wright sought admission to one of the State asylums for the insane as assistant physician, but great was her disappointment to find, after preparing herself especially for that branch of work, that women were not considered eligible for the position of physician in those institutions, sex being the only ground upon which she was rejected. The better to care for her own patients, Dr. Wright was in 1878 made an examiner in lunacy, being the first woman so appointed. 

As a physician Dr. Wright was successful, establishing a large and remunerative practice. Realizing the necessity for women physicians in the field of gynecology, she devoted herself to that branch of the practice of medicine as a specialist. 

In 1878 Dr. Wright was made a trustee of the medical college from which she was graduated. While serving as secretary of the board of trustees, she used her influence to establish women in the chairs of that college, and it was mainly through her determination and perseverance that women succeeded men as professors in that institution. 

Dr. Wright was one of the organizers of the Society for Promoting the Welfare of the Insane, chartered in 1882. She served for many years as president of that society. She was also instrumental in organizing the alumni association of her alma mater, serving for several years as its secretary and afterward as its presiding officer. She was a member of the Medico-Legal Society, the Woman's Legal Education Society, the State and County Homeopathic Medical Societies, and the American Obstetrical Society.

Personal life.
Hannah Amelia Wright died in 1924 and is buried at Warwick Cemetery, <a href="Warwick%2C%20New%20York">Warwick, New York</a>.

Irina Nurislamova

Irina Nurislamova () is a currently a judge of the Arbitration Court of the Republic of <a href="Bashkortostan">Bashkortostan</a>, who became well-known in <a href="Bashneft">Bashneft</a> case.

Biography.
At least from 2006, she was a judge of the magistrates' court for the Arkhangelsky district of Bashkortostan, where she mostly considered administrative cases.

Presumably, she had worked as a lawyer in Bashkortostan before that.

She was appointed to this position in October 2011.

The biggest lawsuits tried by I. Nurislamova as a judge of the Arbitration Court of the Republic of Bashkortostan are as follows:

Bashneft Case.
<a href="Bashneft">Bashneft Case</a> is a corporate conflict between the state-owned company <a href="Rosneft">Rosneft</a> and the privately owned Russian company <a href="Sistema">Sistema</a> PJSFC. It is one of the most controversial corporate legal cases in the history of modern <a href="Russia">Russia</a>.

On 15 May 2017, the Arbitration Court of Bashkortostan registered a RUB 106.6bn claim filed by Rosneft and Bashneft against Sistema, a preliminary hearing of the case was scheduled for 6 June, Irina Nurislamova was appointed as a judge for the case.

On 27 June, the Arbitration Court of Bashkortostan held the first hearing of the claim on the merits, during which it dismissed Sistema's motion to bring <a href="Rosimushchestvo">Rosimushchestvo</a> to the case as a third party and scheduled the next hearing for 12 July. The court also ordered Sistema to produce evidence of the absence of losses from the restructuring of Bashneft and evidence of a positive economic effect from the restructuring, which, as noted by Sistema's lawyers in their objection, runs counter to the Supreme Court's explanation and the existing judicial practice, according to which “the 'burden of proof' lies with the claimants”. Moreover, the judge imposed a freeze on RUB 250bn worth of assets. These measures are unprecedented in the legal practice of Russia. 

On 19 July, after lodging complaints with a number of authorities, Sistema moved for judge recusal in the Rosneft case.

According to Sistema's complaint, Judge Irina Nurislamova granted disproportionate interim relief in violation of the law and on the grounds of unsubstantiated assumptions made by Rosneft and Bashneft, resulting in seizure of RUB 250bn worth of assets, an unprecedented ruling in legal practice. At the same time, the fact that the value of Sistema's assets was 6.5 times the amount of claimed damages was completely disregarded. 

When considering the defendant's appeal against the imposed restrictions, Judge Irina Nurislamova said that the arguments and evidence presented by Sistema had no weight, as the claimants were entitled to preferential treatment. 
For two weeks the judge neglected her duty to refer Sistema's appeal against the interim relief order to the court of appeal. 

For 2 weeks she didn’t refer Sistema’s appeal against the interim relief order to the court of appeal.

In its order regarding the case Judge Irina Nurislamova transferred the burden of proof to Sistema, demanding that it provide evidence of the absence of losses for Bashneft, and dismissed all the motions filed by Sistema.

Panican Whyasker

Panican Whyasker is a Bulgarian four-piece rock’n’roll band formed in the end of 1998 by Dimitar Vasilev-Nufri (guitars & vocals) and Deyan Dragiev-Dakata (drums). Its early years the band spent experimenting with a large range of genres from instrumental drum’n’bass to crossover. After three full-length albums, numerous gigs, several side projects and somewhat of a hiatus the band is currently writing their fourth full-length album - a comeback to their rock’n’roll roots.

The early years and Rock’n’Roll Coma.
Panican Whyasker was started in late 1998 by Dimitar Vasilev-Nufri’s (former Pyromania, Plastic Hi-Fi member) and Deyan Dragiev-Dakata (former Тъмно member). The first Panican Whyasker songs were written before the end of 1998 with Dushko Krumov on the guitar and Alexandar Yanev on the bass. In February 1999 Dushko went to Germany and Ivo Peshev (currently a guitarist in Skitnicks) came aboard. In this line-up and in the spring of 1999 the band recorded their debut album Rock’n’Roll Coma. A year later it was published by Avenue Productions. It’s launch was accompanied by two videos - for the tracks “Лара Крофт“ and “Нов петък“, the latter was shot by Nufri and his wife Bojidara Vasileva at their home. The album was highly appreciated in Bulgaria and awarded Best Debut for 2000 by the Bulgarian music television <a href="MM%20%28television%29">MM TV</a>.

Digital Zombie.
After Rock’n’Roll Coma Panican Whyasker decided to take a different direction. Computers were becoming more and more accessible and those technologies were entering more and more rehearsal rooms and studios. Always open for experiments, the band started mashing <a href="Rock%20and%20roll">rock’n’roll</a> with <a href="drum%E2%80%99n%E2%80%99bass">drum’n’bass</a>. They used samples, loops and in general a lot of electronics. One of their strongest influences of that time could be found in the Serbian band <a href="Disciplin%20A%20Kitschme">Disciplin A Kitschme</a>. 

During that period the underground shows in <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> were mostly located in a cult, now nonexistent venue called O!Shipka. The gigs Panican Whyasker were playing were many, and their fanbase was growing. They lost no time but started recording their second album titled Digital Zombie. In the autumn of 2001, it was released by Top Form Studio, a new collective that Panican Whyasker got involved with for their shared passion for exploring the uprising digital technologies.

The record was distributed by Avenue Productions and was launched on a very special promo show at the now non-existent “Neo” club in Sofia. The event was completely inline with the whole digital concept of the record. It was a high-end multimedia performance, with a special scenography and a lot of live electronics besides Panican Whyasker’s usual rock’n’roll sound.

The record was again accepted favorably by the audience and awarded Best Rock Album for 2001 by the Bulgarian MM TV.

Eastern European Monkeys.
In 2002 Panican Whyasker were already a band with two full-lengths, extensive gig agenda and a set topping 2 hours, something of a rarity for an underground band, especially from Bulgaria. All these live shows lead to the band members starting to wonder in what direction should they move their music to. The decision was to drastically reduce the electronics and start writing songs in English. And so from 2002 to 2005 Panican Whyasker worked on Eastern European Monkeys. It was also published in the spring of 2005 again by Top Form Studio. Its release was accompanied by a video clip for the song Hair Plugin. 

Eastern European Monkeys was strongly criticized because of the English lyrics. The band was annoyed by this feedback and inner conflicts begin to appear. After the record promo gig Alexandar Yanev quit the band. For the next seven years he was replaced by Martin Evstatiev (Subtierra, Der Hunds), but eventually in 2013 left the band as well. The need to be on the look for a new bassist became one of the reasons for the next several problematic years for Panican Whyasker.

Those the band members spent working on side projects. Dakata started playing in <a href="Review%20%28band%29">Ревю</a>, and Nufry started <a href="Bastardolomey">Bastardolomey</a> and later the rock band Skitnicks.

Despite all negative feedback and the slight backdown of some fans Eastern European Monkey was also awarded Best Rock Album in 2005 by MM TV.

Present.
Since 2006 Panican Whyasker have been struggling to write and agree on the material that should become their fourth full-length album. Until 2013 things were going way too slow. Many tracks were created and then thrown away. However, now, with a new bassist on board, namely Alexander Obretenov from the Bulgarian rock band D2, they are more than excited to bring the pieces back together and finally record and release their long-anticipated return.

1987 Okinawan Tu-16 airspace violation

The 1987 Okinawan Tu-16 airspace violation was an incident on December 9, 1987 in which a <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-16">Tupolev Tu-16P Badger J1</a> (an electronic warfare version of the Tu-16 bomber) of the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a> repeatedly <a href="Violations%20of%20Japanese%20airspace">entered Japanese airspace</a> over Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures, prompting a <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%23Japan">F-4EJ Phantom</a> fighter of the <a href="Japan%20Air%20Self-Defense%20Force">Japan Air Self-Defense Force</a> (JASDF) to fire warning shots on two occasions. It was the first time aircraft of the JASDF had done so in response to an aircraft intruding in Japanese airspace. The Soviet Union apologized, claiming that the intrusion was accidental and due to meteorological conditions.

Background.
From 1967 to 1987 Soviet aircraft had violated Japanese airspace 20 times. On September 6, 1976 Soviet pilot <a href="Viktor%20Belenko">Viktor Belenko</a> had flown his <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-25">MiG-25</a> to Hokkaido in order to defect to the United States. Japanese radar had been unable to adequately track him, and the F-4EJ fighters of the <a href="302nd%20Tactical%20Fighter%20Squadron">302nd Tactical Fighter Squadron</a> launched from <a href="Chitose%20Air%20Base">Chitose Air Base</a> had been unable to intercept him. This was a major embarrassment and led to changes in the Japanese air defense system.

In the mid-1980s the Soviet Union had air and naval forces based at <a href="Cam%20Ranh%20Base">Cam Ranh Base</a> in Vietnam. These forces included <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-23">MiG-23</a> fighters and around 16 <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-16">Tupolev Tu-16</a> bombers. Long-ranged Tu-16 aircraft regularly passed Japanese territory traveling between <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> in the Soviet Union to Vietnam. JASDF fighters had previously intercepted them as they neared or entered Japanese airspace.

On August 27th 1987 a Soviet aircraft had entered Japanese airspace near <a href="Rebun%2C%20Hokkaido">Rebun island</a> in Hokkaido.


Aftermath.
On the evening of December 9th the Japanese ministry of foreign affairs announced that they would protest the airspace violation to the Soviet government. The Japanese Prime Minister <a href="Noboru%20Takeshita">Noboru Takeshita</a> stated that it was regrettable that a nuclear capable bomber had violated Japan's airspace the day after the <a href="Intermediate-Range%20Nuclear%20Forces%20Treaty">Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty</a> treaty was signed between the USSR and the USA.

On December 10th Kazuyoshi Hasegawa of the ministry of foreign affairs summoned Nikolai Soloviev, Soviet ambassador to Japan, and expressed Japan's displeasure. Hasegawa requested facts and demanded the punishment of those responsible. The Soviet side blamed poor weather and instrument failure. However, the weather at that time was sunny.

On December 11th a Soviet press conference announced that the responsible person would be punished, but no formal answer was made.

On December 17th the Japanese foreign minister <a href="S%C5%8Dsuke%20Uno">Sōsuke Uno</a> spoke to the Soviet Vice-Foreign minister <a href="Anatoly%20Adamishin">Anatolii Leonidovich Adamishin</a>.

On December 25th the Soviet ambassador Soloviev explained the situation.

At his retirement speech on January 14th, 1988 Lieutenant General Edward L Tixier, the commander of the US <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> mentioned that US aircraft had also been airborne, monitoring the situation.

On February 15th 1988 the Soviet embassy revealed punishments for the crew of the Tu-16.

Reception.
The <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a> review by Mark F.

Having hung out on stage and in the studio with the likes of pianist Vijay Iyer and multi-instrumentalist Henry Threadgill, Ellman brings a natural, forward thinking progression in the creation of music."

In a review for <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a>, Martin Longley notes "Liberty's tunes are steeped in the steely essence of Manhattan, his highly detailed ensemble themes invariably progressing with cool, cerebral detachment."

In an article for "<a href="JazzTimes">JazzTimes</a>" Bill Milkowski says "With his new CD, "Tactiles", Liberty Ellman emerges as one of the most intriguing, albeit unorthodox, guitarists on the New York scene today. An album of original, esoteric compositions marked by dense polyrhythms, dissonant, angular lines and an organic logic that ties the whole thing together in brilliant fashion."

History of the Jews in Freiburg im Breisgau

The History of the Jews in Freiburg dates back to the <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> when, at the site of today's Wasserstraße and Weberstraße, there was reference to a <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a>. In 1328, a <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> was located at 6 Weberstraße.
The Middle Ages.
From as early as 1310, the <a href="Counts%20of%20Freiburg">Counts of Freiburg</a> had acquired the lucrative <a href="Schutzjude">Schutzjude</a> from the Emperor, but the taxes paid were not enough for them meaning that Count Konrad II had amassed 400 silver marks in debts in 1326. Probably because if this dependence, Konrad, alongside his co-ruling son Friedrich, issued a comprehensive writ of protection for the city's inhabitants on 12 October 1338 "in order to avert damages from the Counts". 

When, in 1348, the plague spread across the territory of the German Reich, the writ of protection suddenly no longer applied. On 1 January 1349, before the plague had spread to the Upper Rhine, suspicious Jews were arrested in Freiburg at the instigation of the city council for <a href="well%20poisoning">well poisoning</a>. Whilst being tortured, most of them denied the allegations and accused Jews from other areas through mortal fear. After a <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a> took place at the beginning of January 1349 in Basel, "with the exception of pregnant women, all Jews living in Freiburg were burned on the Friday before Candlemas Day on 31 January due to their misdeeds and murders, which they had instigated and admitted to". The children of those who had been executed were forced to be baptised.

In 1360, the city council allowed the Jews to resettle, but there was great uncertainty and at the request of the city on 14 September 1394, the Austrian landlord, Duke <a href="Leopold%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Leopold IV</a>, issued a order stating that all Jews had to wear <a href="Jewish%20hat">Jewish hats</a> and jackets. They also prohibited the wearing of liturgical colours such as red and green and prohibited them from <a href="Easter%20Week">Easter Week</a>. As a result of news of <a href="Ritual%20killing">ritual killings</a> against Christians in distant Bavaria, on 4 July 1401, the city council, after consulting Duke Leopold, announced the expulsion of all Jews from the pulpits. The councillors solemnly signed the decree "dekein Jude ze Friburg niemmerme sin sol" (no Jews may step foot in Freiburg ever again). Jews were only allowed to stay in Freiburg with the aid of a municipal court and an hourly fee. From 1411 onwards, Jews were accepted again in Freiburg, but during the time of the imperial city (1415-1527), King <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund</a> officially confirmed the decree of 1401 with the "Eternal Expulsion" in 1424. 

Enlightenment and the 19th century.
The situation regarding the Jews only changed when Emperor <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph II</a> proclaimed the <a href="Patent%20of%20Toleration">Patent of Toleration</a> in 1782. The patent formally lifted the existing "Jewish laws" but there were still restrictions on Jewish people's everyday lives. Although Jews were now allowed to attend higher schools and universities, they were still not considered as full-time citizens in Freiburg. In 1809, the city council assaigned a Jewish inn to the Jews in Grünwälderstraße. The inn's first tenant was the first Jewish citizen of Freiburg.

In 1830, when <a href="Leopold%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Baden">Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden</a>, who recognised the constitutional monarchy as a learned political scientist, had taken office, the state parliament debated about the emancipation of the Jews. There was however resistance to the debates of 1831 in the second chamber. <a href="Karl%20von%20Rotteck">Karl von Rotteck</a>, in particular, became the spokesman for the representatives, who had demanded that the Jews deserved extended rights with increased integration. in 1835, the Grand Duke abolished all special charges against the Jews. As late as 1862, there was fierce resistance in Freiburg, especially against the freedom of movement. The merchants in particular wanted to keep the banning of the Jews in Freiburg, which had existed since 1425 and confirmed in 1809, in fear of competition. In a petition to the state parliament, it was said that "we are become a nest for Jews."

Between 1869 and 1870, the Old Synagogue was built according to plans set out by Georg Jakob Schneider in Rempartstraße (later Werthmannplatz, now the Platz der Alten Synagoge). In 1870, the Jewish Cemetery in Freiburg was first used and is still in use to this day.

National Socialism.
At the end of January 1933 in Berlin, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler%27s%20rise%20to%20power">the seizing of control</a> by the National Socialists quickly spread through Freiburg. On 6 March, the Nazis, without the consent of Mayor Karl Bender, hoisted the <a href="Flag%20of%20Germany%23Nazi%20Germany%20and%20World%20War%20II%20.281933.E2.80.9345.29">Swastika flag</a> at Freiburg's City Hall. On 17 March, between 4 and 5 o'clock, the Social Democratic and Jewish parliamentary representative Christian Daniel Nußbaum was arrested, who then fatally injured a police officer with a shot through the apartment door. In the course of events, the publishing house of <a href="Volkswacht%20%28Freiburg%29">Volkswacht (Freiburg)</a>, or "People's Guard", was stormed by members of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">NSDAP</a>, <a href="Sturmabteilung">SA</a>, <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> and the <a href="Stahlhelm%2C%20Bund%20der%20Frontsoldaten">Stahlhelm</a>, who threw 16,000 freshly printed newspapers onto the street and tried to light them. Journalist and Social Democrat Käthe Vordtriede thereby lost her job. On 18 March, all local organisations of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> and <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany">KPD</a>, including their auxiliary and subsidiary organisations, were dissolved in Freiburg.

On 28 March 1933, the Jewish SPD city councillor Max Mayer resigned his mandate as a result of the Provisional Law for the Co-ordination of Countries with the Reich. On 31 March 1933, SPD city councillor Robert Grumbach also resigned his mandate for the same reason. The <a href="Nazi%20boycott%20of%20Jewish%20businesses">Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses</a> was only followed halfheartedly by the citizens of Freiburg.

As in many places across Germany, during the <a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> on 10 November 1938, the Old Synagogue went up in flames. Subsequently, 100 men aged 18 or older were taken to <a href="Dachau%20concentration%20camp">Dachau concentration camp</a> north of Munich for "<a href="protective%20custody">protective custody</a>" and <a href="immigration%20detention">immigration detention</a>.

On 22 October 1940, as across Baden, the deportation of the Jews took place in Freiburg in accordance to the framework set out by the Wagner-Bürckel campaign. They were originally taken to <a href="Gurs%20internment%20camp">Gurs internment camp</a> near the Spanish border and then later to the extermination camps.

Numerous "Stolpersteine" were installed across Freiburg as a way of recollecting those taken to the camps. The project "Vordtriebe-Haus Freiburg" is devoted to the journalist Kthe Vordtriede and her children who had emigrated. In the city district of Rieselfeld, a street is named after her.
Modern times.
On 7 September 1945, a Jewish worship service took place in Freiburg for the first time in five years. For this purpose, the city provided a room at the <a href="Historical%20Merchants%27%20Hall%20%28Freiburg%29">Historical Merchants' Hall</a>. The "Israeli Rural Community of South Baden" founded in Freiburg at the end of 1945, had its headquarters located on Hansjakobstraße 8.

On 11 November 1947, the city made former city councillor Robert Grumbach deputy for all Jews in Freiburg an honorary citizen. 

On 1 December 1948, the city and state carried out a settlement with the Jewish community, according to which the city would remain the owner of the former synagogue site. In return, the city undertook a restoration of the Jewish cemetery, the walled-in cemetery and the building of a guard house with a cemetery hall.

In 1953, the Jewish community supported by the French military rabbis set up a prayer room on Holbeinstraße 25. On 16 June 1985, the foundations were laid for a new synagogue, which was opened on 5 November 1985. It was built near the minster on land which the city had provided free of charge. The city paid over one million Deutschmarks for the construction costs, the state provided a further 3.5 million out of the 7 million Deutschmarks required. 

At present, the Orthodox Israeli community in Freiburg has about 750 active members. Alongside this, the <a href="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> Jewish Chawurah Gescher community is also active in Freiburg,

Bin tipper

A bin tipper, also known as a bin-tipper, bin lifter, cart dumper or Dumpmaster, is a <a href="machine">machine</a> which <a href="Mechanical%20engineering">mechanically</a> lifts and inverts <a href="bins">bins</a> for the purpose of emptying them. Bin tippers are a type of <a href="lifting%20equipment">lifting equipment</a> used in many industries, including <a href="waste%20management">waste management</a>, <a href="food%20processing">food processing</a>, <a href="Chemical%20industry">chemical manufacturing</a> and <a href="facility%20management">facility management</a>.

Although bin tippers are often components of larger machines (such as <a href="Garbage%20truck">garbage trucks</a>), an increasing number of 'standalone' or mobile units are available. Most bin tippers use <a href="mains%20electricity">mains electricity</a> to power the lifting system, but some are powered by <a href="Battery%20%28electricity%29">batteries</a>, <a href="Solar%20power">solar</a>, <a href="Crank_%28mechanism%29">crank-handle</a>, or <a href="compressed%20air">compressed air</a>.

Operational principal.
Bin tippers typically have a steel frame, guarding and cradle, with a motor or crank-handle driving a lifting <a href="Mechanism%20%28engineering%29">mechanism</a>, which may be <a href="Hydraulics">hydraulic</a> or <a href="Chain_drive">chain operated</a>. Bins are placed into the machine, then lifted and inverted over the destination receptacle, allowing the contents to be emptied by <a href="gravity">gravity</a>.

Most bin tippers are designed to comply with one of three <a href="Technical_standard">standards</a>:

History.
A side-load bin tipper was fitted to a garbage truck as early as 1929, by the Heil company in America. In the 1950's the <a href="Dempster%20Brothers">Dempster Dumpmaster</a> popularized the front-end loader variant, with bins being tipped over the cab of the truck. Both types of integrated bin tipper are now common on municipal refuse collection trucks.

Standalone bin tippers developed later, with the release of a machine called the Simpro Ezi-Dump in 1990. This type of machine is now common on large commercial facilities, events venues and campuses, since it allows smaller mobile bins to be dispersed for waste collection, then emptied into a skip bin or dumpster; which in turn can be emptied by a front-load garbage truck.

The use of bin tippers and other lifting aids has been stimulated in recent years by research linking heavy manual lifting with musculoskeletal disorders; some government organisations, schools and companies now prohibit emptying bins by hand. Health and safety concerns have also driven the adoption of bin tippers in the manufacturing, food-processing and construction industries.

The Church of St Hywyn, <a href="Aberdaron">Aberdaron</a>, <a href="Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a> is a parish church dating from the 12th century. Its origins are earlier, as a <a href="Clas%20%28ecclesiastical%20settlement%29">"clas" church</a> from the 5th to the 7th centuries. Further building, including the construction of the second nave, took place in the late 15th or early 16th centuries. Its importance was as an embarkation point for the <a href="abbey">abbey</a> on <a href="Bardsey%20Island">Bardsey Island</a> which became a significant site of <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a> saw the church's decline, and by the 19th century it was a ruin. In the 1850s a new church, "Eglwys Newydd", was constructed inland, but proved so unpopular that St Hywyn's was restored. The <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> poet <a href="R.%20S.%20Thomas">R. S. Thomas</a> was minister at the church which is a <a href="Listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>.

History.
The origins of the church are as a "clas" settlement from the <a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">Dark Ages</a> of the 5th to the 7th centuries. The clas was founded by St Hywyn, an early <a href="list%20of%20Welsh%20saints">Welsh Saint</a>. The settlement rose in importance after 1190 when <a href="Bardsey%20Island">Bardsey Island</a>, the "Island of 20,000 Saints", and <a href="St%20Davids">St Davids</a> in <a href="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a> where declared places of pilgrimage by the <a href="Pope">Papacy</a>. The writer <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a> notes that visits to both sites equated to a single pilgrimage to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. St Hywyn's expanded greatly to accommodate the very large numbers of pilgrims sailing to Bardsey Abbey, who were fed and watered in the Great Kitchen ("Y Gegin Fawr") next to the church. The present building is first recorded in 1115 and further building took place in the 14th and 15th centuries. 

Following the Reformation, the church declined, experiencing a long history of non-resident clergy. By the 1840s, it had become ruinous and a new church was built further inland. The new church provide to be unpoulqar, however, and by 1868 the original church had been restored and brought back into use. Further restorations took place in the 19th and 20th centuries. The church, known as "The Cathedral of Llyn", remains an active church in the Bro Enlli Ministry Area.

The poet R. S. Thomas was minister at the church from 1967 to 1978.

Tamsin Blanchard

Tamsin Blanchard is a British fashion journalist, author, and lecturer. She is particularly known for her work on sustainability and ecological issues in fashion.

Early life and education.
Blanchard was born in Liverpool and took a fashion journalism course at <a href="Central%20Saint%20Martins">Central Saint Martins</a>.

Journalism.
In 1998 Blanchard started up a biannual fashion and visual arts magazine titled "IT", for which she was publisher and co-editor. She was also at "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" as a fashion editor, and from 1999 to 2005 was Style Editor at "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>". She then joined "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" as style director for their magazine.

The <a href="Fashion%20Museum%2C%20Bath">Fashion Museum, Bath</a>, chose Blanchard as the fashion journalist to select the most defining looks of 1996 for their <a href="Dress%20of%20the%20Year">Dress of the Year</a> collection. She picked out an <a href="Alexander%20McQueen">Alexander McQueen</a> tunic and 'bumster' trousers from his "Hunger" collection for the womenswear look, and a man's <a href="Paul%20Smith%20%28fashion%20designer%29">Paul Smith</a> electric blue two-piece suit and shirt. At the press launch, the clothes were modelled by <a href="Jimmy%20Pursey">Jimmy Pursey</a> and his then partner Tizer Bailey, the model who had originally worn the McQueen ensemble in the designer's catwalk presentation. Blanchard said at the time that McQueen, who had recently succeeded <a href="John%20Galliano">John Galliano</a> as the designer for <a href="Givenchy">Givenchy</a>, was one of the strongest representations of mid-nineties "cutting-edge style," whilst Smith's suit represented the revolution in menswear where the male consumer was increasingly aware of labels and design.

Blanchard is also a fashion correspondent for the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>'s magazine and a contributing editor to "<a href="10%20Magazine%20%28British%20magazine%29">10 Magazine</a>."

Blanchard has been invited to teach fashion journalism at the <a href="University%20of%20Westminster">University of Westminster</a> and Central Saint Martins.

Author.
Blanchard's best-known book is probably "Green is the New Black: How to Change the World with Style", published in 2007 and dealing with ecological awareness in a fashion-conscious lifestyle. <a href="TreeHugger">TreeHugger</a> reviewed the book favourably, noting that while Blanchard was not as authoritative on eco-issues as <a href="Lucy%20Siegle">Lucy Siegle</a>, she had still written a well-informed, fair-handed book that wrote accessibly about how to be both fashion-conscious and environmentally aware, and the EcoSalon website listed it as among their top 15 books on eco-fashion. However, a reviewer for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mail">The Daily Mail</a>" dismissed the book as "utter pointlessness." The book established Blanchard as an authority on the subject of eco-consciousness in fashion, leading to her being approached for commentary on the topic.


Personal life.
Blanchard lives in London with her partner and their children.

John Johnson (inventor)

John Johnson was an instrument maker of dental supplies. He was a nineteenth century pioneer photographer and an inventor. He make with <a href="Alexander%20S.%20Wolcott%20%28inventor%29">Alexander S. Wolcott</a> the world's first commercial portrait studio.

Early life.
Johnson was born in <a href="Saco%2C%20Maine">Saco, Maine</a> on May 28, 1813. His father was William Short Johnson.

Mid life.
Johnson lived his childhood and got his initial schooling in <a href="Pembroke%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Pembroke, New Hampshire</a>. After high school when a young man he worked for a watchmaker in New York City for a few years. Later he went into a business with Alexander Simon Wolcott, an instrument maker, and they formed a partnership with their photography firm in New York City.

Photography.
Johnson took to Wolcott on October 6, 1839, a detailed copy of the specifications on <a href="Louis%20Jacques%20Mande%20Daguerre">Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre</a>'s method of capturing a likeness of a person. Wolcott was familiar with the mechanics of optics and experimented on improving Daguerre's basic methods of using lenses. Wolcott came up with the concept that exposure time could be reduced by an improvement on the mechanical arrangement of the image focusing process. This was by using a concave reflector of a 3-4 inch diameter that produced a short focus length. The focused image was formed onto a chemically treated silver surface that was sensitive to light. The image stored on this chemically treated plate of about 2 by 2.5 inches could hold the picture indefinitely.

Wolcott then made a camera that day with improvements on Daguerre's method. The camera was a wooden box 15 inches long, 8.5 inches high, and 8 inches wide. There was a 7-inch concave mirror in the back of the camera. The camera was constructed so that it had a large opening in front where the light rays of the person of the portrait passed through an <a href="aperture">aperture</a>. The photo-sensitive 2 inch exposure plate was in a detachable frame in the center of this aperture opening, just inside the box. The operator of the camera would set up the focusing of the portrait picture on an unsensitized plate first. Then once the camera was focused with all of the mechanical items involved, then the camera operator would replace the focusing plate with the sensitized plate to take the picture.
Photography historians Dr. Robert Taft and Patrick Robertson stated that Wolcott took a picture of Johnson as the first portrait in the world on October 7, 1839. On March 4, 1840, they opened the first studio in the world as a commercial enterprise for taking pictures of people. The customer would sit for their likeness to be captured on a permanent median for future viewing. The commercial photography studio was located in New York City at Broadway and Chamber Street. Johnson with Wolcott created the world's first photography portrait studio as a business. They opened their commercial daguerreotype photography portrait studio in March 1840.

Wolcott's camera technology was taken to London by Johnson's father, William S. Johnson, in February 1840. A European franchise financial arrangement was worked out by W. S. Johnson with <a href="Richard%20Beard%20%28photographer%29">Richard Beard</a>, a coal merchant and entrepreneur. They hired <a href="John%20Frederick%20Goddard">John Frederick Goddard</a>, a chemist and lecturer in optics. Goddard came up a chemistry formula to make the image plate sensitive to light so that an image would develop on it much faster than the <a href="daguerreotype">daguerreotype</a> cameras of the time. The image plate used <a href="Iodine%20monochloride">iodine chloride</a> to make the plates sensitive to light, which helped to shorten the camera exposure time. The concave mirror reflector improvement and the photo-sensitive plate were the key innovative features Wolcott based his 1840 camera invention on that made portraits a possibility. This made exposure time to as low as a few minutes in bright sunlight, and since a person could be still for that long it make portraits possible using this state-of-the-art photography. Beard then opened the first public portrait studio of Europe in London in March 1841, the Daguerrean gallery at the Polytechnic Institute. Beard developed franchises of portrait studios throughout England.

Later life.
Johnson died on May 3, 1871, in Saco, Maine.

Downtown Three Rivers Commercial Historic District

The Downtown Three Rivers Commercial Historic District is a commercial historic district located along North Main Street, between Michigan and Portage Avenues, in <a href="Three%20Rivers%2C%20Michigan">Three Rivers, Michigan</a>. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1982.

History.
The original section of Three Rivers, including what is now the downtown and some surrounding residential areas, was platted in 1836 by John H. Bowman. This location immediately began to serve as the commercial center of the settlement, with modest wooden buildings constructed along what is now Main Street as early as the 1830s. A number of mills were constructed in the area in the 1830s and 1840s, and in 1851 the Lockport Hydraulic Company was formed to dam the river and construct a power canal. This was followed in 1853 by the construction of a railroad line through the village. As a result, Three Rivers boomed in the latter half of the 19th century, with a wave of new construction starting in the 1850s.

The oldest extant buildings in the district are the Kelsey block at 39-43 N. Main (built in 1854), the Whitesell and McMurtrie block at 109 Portage (built in 1859), and the 1861 block at 18 N. Main. Further construction filled the downtown in the 1860s, 70s, and 80s. These buildings were constructed almost exclusively by local investors, primarily merchants. Seven of the commercial blocks, however, were built by farmer Isaac Null over the period of 1863-1886. In 1884, Null also built his house, located within the district at 105 W. Michigan. The downtown area remains one of the most intact nineteenth and early twentieth-century downtowns in southwest Michigan

Description.
The Downtown Three Rivers Commercial Historic District contains all the structures remaining from Three Rivers' late 19th century commercial center. The district contains 48 structures, including one residence, the former public library, and 46 one- to three-story commercial buildings. The commercial buildings are predominantly Commercial <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> structures, and are set side by side and directly on the sidewalk. The visually unified and harmonious Late Victorian streetscape gives the district its character.

Alexander S. Wolcott (inventor)

Alexander Simon Wolcott (also Alexander S. Wolcott and A. S. Wolcott) was a maker of medical supplies. He was a nineteenth-century pioneer photographer and inventor. He made with <a href="John%20Johnson%20%28inventor%29">John Johnson</a> the world's first commercial photography portrait studio and patented the first US camera that made photographs.

Early life.
Wolcott was born on June 14, 1804, in <a href="New%20London%2C%20Connecticut">New London, Connecticut</a>. He was the son of Alexander Wolcott, Sr. and Joanne (Paull) Wolcott.

Photography.
Wolcott lived in New York City in the 1830s and made dental supplies and instruments for a living. In 1839 he became an associated with Johnson, a jeweler and watchmaker's assistant. Johnson took to Wolcott on October 6, 1839, a copy of the specifications on Daguerre's method of capturing a likeness of a person and storing on a permanent plate that would hold the picture indefinitely. They made a camera that day based on Daguerre's method and started experimenting with it.

Wolcott improved on Daguerre's lens camera by making a camera that used a mirror instead. On October 7, 1839, Wolcott made the first portrait in the world with a prototype of his daguerreotype camera when he took a picture of his partner Johnson. Wolcott patented it on May 8, 1840 (US #1,582). It became known as "Wolcott's camera" and referred to as the "mirror camera." It was the first US patent in photography.

Wolcott and Johnson started using their camera on March 4, 1840, in New York City business on Broadway called the "Daguerreian Parlor" that made commercial portraits in a studio. It was in the Granite Building. They had opened the world's first commercial daguerreotype gallery, a portrait photography studio. By June they had a branch studio in Washington D.C., which was operated by John G. Stevenson.

Wolcott's patented camera used a polished concave mirror to reflect the focused light onto a photosensitive plate that was less than a half inch square. The pictures were not a <a href="Negative%20%28photography%29">negative image</a> of reverse colors, but a correct <a href="Positive%20%28photography%29">positive image</a> that did not require reversion of the image. The size of the photo-sensitive plate was eventually increased to just over two square inches that they could make a likeness image, because of their refined mechanical lighting techniques.

Wolcott and Johnson continued to improve their photography techniques as time went on. Wolcott improved his photo-sensitive plate and came up with a chemical "accelerator" that was a mix of <a href="bromide">bromide</a> and <a href="chloride">chloride</a>. This along with improved polished silver plates earned them a second U.S. patent in photography in December 1841, designated #2,391. They also came up with new innovative studio lighting by designing special outdoor mirrors that provided more light to the inside studio itself for faster better quality portrait pictures.

Later life.
Wolcott died on November 10, 1844, in <a href="Stamford%2C%20Connecticut">Stamford, Connecticut</a>.

Old City of Freiburg

The Old City of Freiburg is part of the city and business centres of <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg im Breisgau</a> and is the core of the original city. It is divided into the two districts 111 "Altstadt-Mitte" and 112 "Altstadt-Ring". The "Altstadt-Mitte" district was the city's build-up area at the time of its foundation and therefore formed the old city. The district "Altstadt-Ring" is connected westwards to the railway line and south to the Dreisam.

At the end of 2013, about 7,400 people were reported as inhabitants of this district.

The district of "Altstadt-Mitte" was designed according to the pattern of all cities founded by the Zähringers. A street cross divides the city into four quarters, the church and the city hall are not located in the same district. The city centre is the <a href="Bertoldsbrunnen">Bertoldsbrunnen</a>, where the <a href="Kaiser-Joseph-Stra%C3%9Fe">Kaiser-Joseph-Straße</a> and <a href="Salzstra%C3%9Fe%20%28Salt%20Road%20in%20Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau%29">Salz</a>- and Bertoldstraße intersect. The city administration is located in the Old and New city hall. In the late 1990s, however, the head of the administrative region of Freiburg moved its headquarters from the Old City into a new building in the district of Betzenhausen, but the seat of the government president remained in the "Basler Hof" in the Old City.

Neighbouring districts include Stühlinger to the west, Neuburg to the north, Oberau to the east and beyond the Dreisam the Wiehre to the south.

Tourist attractions.
The Old City is dominated bu the <a href="Freiburg%20Minster">Freiburg Minster</a> at the <a href="Minster%20Square%20%28Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau%29">Minster Square</a>. Also most of the other architectural sight of the city, like the <a href="Schwabentor%20%28Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau%29">Schwabentor</a>, <a href="Martinstor">Martinstor</a>, <a href="Augustiner%20Museum">Augustiner Museum</a> are located in the Old City. The Freiburger <a href="Freiburg%20B%C3%A4chle">Bächle</a> are at their highest in the Old City and flow from there across the entire city centre. The <a href="Schlossberg%20%28Freiburg%29">Schlossberg</a> is directly adjacent to the Old City. From the <a href="Aussichtsturm%20Schlossberg">Schlossbergturm</a>, or Castle Hill Tower, you are about have a circular view of all the city's districts and surrounding areas.

Culture and Education.
The Old City is the centre for cultural life in Freiburg. The <a href="Theater%20Freiburg">Theater Freiburg</a>, the <a href="Konzerthaus%20Freiburg">Konzerthaus Freiburg</a>, most of the museums and cinemas, the headquarters of the city's library as well as the Planetarium located at the <a href="Freiburg%20Hauptbahnhof">Freiburg's main train station</a> are all located in the Old City.

Alternative culture is also accessible in the Old Town, mainly in the "Viertel Im Grün" (named after the street of the same name) between the Konzerthaus and the Dreisam. Two centres are the "Sprecht Passage," the "Jos Fritz" shop, the cafe with the same name, the <a href="Harrys%20Depot">Harrys Depot</a>, the "Grether" factory, a former foundry, which includes the Radio Dreyeckland studios, the "Rosa Hilfe Freiburg" and the "Strandcafé".

The <a href="University%20of%20Freiburg">University of Freiburg</a> is also located in the Old City, alongside the faculties of humanities and social sciences as well as the university library.

Transport.
The district of "Altstadt-Mitte" has been a pedestrian zone since the mid-1870s. After the ring road was blocked between the two districts in 2012, the pedestrian zone was partially extended to the district "Altstadt-Ring". The boundaries of the built-up old city form multi-lane streets as the main traffic arteries of individual traffic. Car parking is concentrated to several car parking areas on the main traffic axes, whilst in other streets residents have their own car parks.

On the two main axes of the Old City, the Kaiser-Joseph-Straße and Berrtoldstraße and Salzstrae (to the east of Bertoldsbrunnen) are now served by <a href="Trams%20in%20Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">trams</a>. The intersection of the lines at Bertoldsbrunnen is the most important hub of public transport in Freiburg, as the city centre is located next to the main railway station on the edge of the Old City and the border to Stühlinger.

Among the questions that her editors desired her to investigate were the socialist movement in Germany, the principles of the sub-treasury system in England, and the impetus that the temperance movement received in 
Germany.

Radical Democracy Party (United States)

The Radical Democracy Party was an <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> and <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">anti-Confederate</a> political party in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. The party was formed to contest the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">1864 Presidential election</a>. The party was made up largely of disaffected <a href="Radical%20Republican">radical Republicans</a> who felt that President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> was too moderate on the issues of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> and <a href="racial%20equality">racial equality</a>. The party threatened to act as a <a href="Spoiler%20effect">spoiler</a> against Lincoln, but ultimately the decision was taken not to run a candidate.

History.
Cleveland convention.
The new party convened in Chapin’s Hall in <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> on at the end of May 1864, one week before the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="1864%20National%20Union%20National%20Convention">convention</a>. Different estimates were given on the number of attendees, ranging from 200 to 2,000. Often the number given depended on the political leanings of those making the estimate. As well as radical Republicans, there were also a number of <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> who were unhappy with their own party’s perceived lack of dedication to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">war against the Confederacy</a>. Noted abolitionist and previous Republican presidential candidate <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a> was nominated for president, while the ‘<a href="War%20Democrat">War Democrat</a>’ <a href="John%20Cochrane%20%28general%29">John Cochrane</a> was nominated as Vice President. Among the notable figures who attended or supported the Convention were <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, <a href="Elizabeth%20Cady%20Stanton">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a> and <a href="Parker%20Pillsbury">Parker Pillsbury</a>. Abolitionist <a href="Wendell%20Phillips">Wendell Phillips</a> did not attend in person but wrote a letter on behalf of the new organisation which was read out. In it he criticised Lincoln’s model of <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">reconstruction</a>, citing the experience of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> following its recapture by Union forces. He stated that Lincoln’s model ‘makes the freedom of the negro a sham, and perpetuates Slavery under a softer name’.

The platform adopted at Cleveland called for the continuation of the war without compromise, a <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitutional</a> amendment banning slavery and authorizing equal rights, confiscation of rebel property, control of post-war reconstruction by <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> and enforcement of the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a>. The platform also called for a one-term presidency as well as other implicit calls for civil service reform. To appeal to Democrats, the platform adopted emphasised the protection of the rights of <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">free speech</a>, a <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">free press</a> and the writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" as the Democrats had criticised Lincoln on these issues. Historian <a href="James%20M.%20McPherson">James M. McPherson</a> has argued that because of the party wished to appeal to Democrats it refused to take on specific calls for <a href="black%20suffrage">black suffrage</a> and land grants for freed slaves that it might otherwise have explicitly endorsed.

Campaign.
Many of the new party’s supporters did not necessarily want it stand in the election. Rather the hope was that the formation of a new party would cause Lincoln not to gain the Republican nomination. Although this did not occur, Frémont maintained over the course of his campaign that he would drop out if Lincoln did likewise, in favour of a candidate whose platform more closely matched the ideals of the radical Republicans.

Frémont gained the support of a number of prominent abolitionists. However, the majority of radical Republicans continued to support Lincoln, as it was felt that Frémont could not win and that supporting him would split the abolitionist vote in favour of the Democrat candidate, <a href="George%20McClellan">George McClellan</a>. Additionally, many were less than enthusiastic about the party platform with its compromises aiming to attract Democrats. Frémont continued these overtures during his campaign. As the campaign failed to gain momentum, many abolitionists urged Frémont to withdraw his nomination. No major newspaper supported Frémont. However, some Democrat supporting newspapers such as the "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>" did talk up Frémont’s credentials in order to disunite Republicans. Confederates as well as Democrats took a close interest in Frémont’s campaign, hoping it could help McClellan win in November.

Withdrawal.
Frémont and Cochrane dropped out of the race on 21 September. In a letter to the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" Frémont wrote that it had become increasingly clear that the Democrats could neither be trusted on the issue of union or abolition. As such, he did not want to act as a spoiler against Lincoln. He remained critical of Lincoln administration, writing that ‘his Administration has been politically, militarily and financially, a failure, and that its necessary continuance is a cause of regret for the country.’ In another letter to the same paper written one week previously but published in the same edition, he wrote that the ideas of the Radical Democracy Party would nevertheless be pursued. It has been speculated that Frémont’s withdrawal may have been part of a deal with Lincoln whereby the more conservative Postmaster General <a href="Montgomery%20Blair">Montgomery Blair</a> was removed from his post.

Most Radical Democracy Party supports went on to support Lincoln in the election. There were some exceptions to this, notably Wendell Philips. The party itself was finished, having only be formed to run a candidate in that one race.

Paridhi (c. 13th century CE), also referred to as Paridhiyaar, was a <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> literary commentator known for his <a href="Literary%20criticism">commentary</a> on the "<a href="Thirukkural">Thirukkural</a>". He was among the canon of <a href="ten%20ancient%20commentators">ten ancient commentators</a> of the Kural text most highly esteemed by scholars. He was also among the five ancient commentators whose works had been preserved and made available to the <a href="Modern%20era">Modern era</a>, the others being <a href="Manakkudavar">Manakkudavar</a>, <a href="Pari%20Perumal">Pari Perumal</a>, <a href="Kaalingar">Kaalingar</a>, and <a href="Parimelazhagar">Parimelazhagar</a>.

Variations in ordering of the Kural verses.
The following table depicts the variations among the early commentators in ordering, for example, the first ten verses of the Tirukkural. Note that the ordering of the verses and chapters as set by Parimelazhagar, which had been followed unanimously for centuries ever since, has now been accepted as the standard structure of the Kural text.
Comparing the verse ordering by various ancient commentators with that of Manakkudavar, the first of the ancient commentators whose commentary is available, it can be reckoned that Paridhi's commentary follows closely Manakkudavar's, save for a few variations. The modern chapters 10, 13, 17, 18, and 19 appearing under the subsection "Domestic virtues" of the Kural text appear as chapters 26, 27, 30, 31, and 32, respectively, under the subsection "Ascetic virtues" in Manakkudavar's commentary. Similarly, the modern chapters 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, appearing under the subsection "Ascetic virtues" appear as chapters 19, 20, 10, 16, 17, 18, respectively, under the subsection "Domestic virtues" in Manakkudavar's work. Nevertheless, being the earliest available commentary of the Tirukkural, Manakkudavar's work is considered to bear the closest semblance with the original work of the Kural text by <a href="Valluvar">Valluvar</a>.

The following table shows the numbering of variations found in the ordering of the Kural verses by various ancient commentators with respect to the commentary by Manakkudavar.

Letter to Blanchy

Letter to Blanchy is a 1990s New Zealand television comedy series written by <a href="David%20McPhail">David McPhail</a> and <a href="A.%20K.%20Grant">A. K. Grant</a>, starring McPhail with <a href="Jon%20Gadsby">Jon Gadsby</a> and <a href="Peter%20Rowley">Peter Rowley</a> as three smalltown Kiwi blokes, Barry (Gadsby), Derek (McPhail) and Ray (Rowley). "A situation comedy where three unlikely characters commit various outrages on the property (and good nature) of their long-suffering friend Blanchy." Barry starts each episode by reading a letter to his unseen mate Blanchy; generally a letter of apology or explanation . They drink beer in a seedy bar and cause havoc with their well-intentioned schemes. Described as "a concept whose time had come – about 20 years ago" or as "Last of the Summer Wine" as written by <a href="Barry%20Crump">Barry Crump</a>.

Production history.
In the late 1980s, TVNZ made a pilot which was never shown. Then in 1989 <a href="Three%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Three</a> screened an hour-episode in the new channel’s first week on Friday 1 December from 7.30 to 8.30 pm. Director <a href="Ian%20Mune">Ian Mune</a> said it was a comedy of foibles about people getting into appalling trouble because they’re either cocky or stupid or trying to impress someone or they’re opportunists. No more episodes were made because of financial difficulties. 

Three series were screened on <a href="TVNZ1">TVNZ1</a> in 1994 (6 episodes), 1996 (11 episodes), and 1997 (10 episodes); the episodes were of half an hour.

After three years (and after TV3’s option expired) TVNZ made the first series which got solid ratings, so a second series was commissioned. Although shot in Auckland, and written by McPhail and Grant from Christchurch, it is set in a kinder, gentler small town in New Zealand called Nettleton, where back doors could be left unlocked. 

In September 1996 a third series was commissioned; filmed in January it screened in winter 1997. The series won a New Zealand Film and Television Award for the script of the episode “Stir Crazy”, and proved that the series appeal was not restricted to the over-55s. Gadsby said that the series appealed to the same audience as Heartland and the Topp Twins, and Grant said that most families have a brother-in-law who borrows your gear and buggers everything up. 

A book (with eight chapters) was published in 1997, and a theatre tour made in 2008.

Reception.
For the last two series Letter to Blanchy averaged 640,700 per episode which was very high viewership.

Controversy.
Funding was originally refused by the Broadcasting Commission; Ruth Hartley calling it "racist and sexist", then its successor New Zealand on Air backed it.

European strategic intelligence and security center

The European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center (ESISC) is an <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a> dealing with issues related to terrorism and security. The center is also providing lobbying services.

About ESISC.
ESISC was founded in April 2002. Journalist <a href="Claude%20Moniquet">Claude Moniquet</a> is the head of the center.

In August 2007, the Belgian Ministry of the Interior renounced the advisory services of ESISC accusing Claude Moniquet of embezzlement and illegal possession of arms.

Election Observers.
Representatives of ESISC participated in 2013 Azerbaijani presidential elections and 2015 parliamentary elections as observers. They evaluated the elections positively and criticized the assessments of the <a href="OSCE">OSCE</a>/<a href="ODIHR">ODIHR</a> mission, in which the elections were recognized as inappropriate to democratic norms..

Criticism.
According to the “Freedom Files Analytical Center”, ESISC lobbies for Azerbaijan’s interests and provides services of “false observers,” whose task is to participate in the elections of autocratic states as observers, inform on a democratic vote, and criticize the OSCE/ ODIHR observation mission.

According to Robert Coalson (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty), ESISC is a part of Baku's lobbying efforts to use analytical centers to change public opinion about Azerbaijan..

Report on Western Sahara.
In 2005, ESISC issued a report on <a href="Western%20Sahara">Western Sahara</a> and <a href="Polisario">Polisario</a>, which claimed the link between Polisario and “<a href="Al%20Qaeda">Al Qaeda</a>”. The Moroccan opposition magazine “<a href="Le%20Journal%20Hebdomadaire">Le Journal Hebdomadaire</a>” criticized this report writing that it reflects the official views of the Moroccan government and that the Moroccan authorities funded this report. Jacob Mundi considers this report as a part of the Moroccan propaganda designed to discredit the Polisario Front.. The magazine “Le Journal Hebdomadaire” described the authors of the report as “journalists of the royal court.” Claude Moniquet sued the journal on charges of defamation. “Le Journal Hebdomadaire” invited Moniquet to respond to the journal on charges, but she refused. As “Human Rights House” noted, Moniquet filed a lawsuit not in the Belgian court, where ESISC is based, and even not in France, where the center publishes its newsletter, but in Moroccan court. The court ordered “Le Journal Hebdomadaire” to pay Claude Moniquet 360 thousand dollars. According to Moroccan journalists, this was the largest lawsuit against the media in Morocco. The lawyers of the magazine were not allowed to call expert witnesses; the court did not give any reasons of the amount of the fine.

The organization “<a href="Reporters%20Without%20Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>” (RWB) described this trial as “politically motivated and unfair.”

Report “Republic of Azerbaijan: a model of good governance”.
A month before the 2013 Azerbaijani presidential elections were held, ESISC issued a report entitled “The Republic of Azerbaijan: a model of good governance”. According to Robert Coalson, a correspondent of “<a href="Radio%20Free%20Europe">Radio Free Europe</a>”, in this “randomly compiled” report in illiterate English, “the stable social welfare of Azerbaijan” is lauded, it is said in the report that women's rights are “comparable to those of citizens of EU member states” and it is also mentioned that there is “full respect for religious minorities” in Azerbaijan..

The report “The Armenian Connection”.
On March 6 2017, ESISC published the report “The Armenian Connection,” which accused a number of NGOs specializing in human rights protection and research organizations, criticizing human rights abuses and corruption in Azerbaijan, Turkey and Russia. In this report, ESISC claimed that the report “Cavalry diplomacy” contains misleading information and is aimed at creating a network of PACE deputies, who will participate in the political war against Azerbaijan.

In the second part of the report, which was published on April 18, 2017, ESISC claimed that the anti-Azerbaijani network included a number of prime ministers of European countries, Armenian officials and public organizations: “<a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>”, “<a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>”, “Human Rights House Foundation”, “Open Dialog”, “<a href="European%20Stability%20Initiative">European Stability Initiative</a>”, “<a href="Helsinki%20Committee%20for%20Human%20Rights">Helsinki Committee for Human Rights</a>”, etc. According to the report, the <a href="Soros%20Foundation">Soros Foundation</a>, which main human rights commissioner, <a href="Nils%20Muiznieks">Nils Muiznieks</a>, has been the key figure of the network since 2012, funds this anti-Azerbaijani network, which served the interests of <a href="George%20Soros">George Soros</a> and The Republic of Armenia.

Criticism.
As the “Freedom Files Analytical Center” notes, the report is written in the worst traditions of authoritarian propaganda, it contains absurd claims and tries to stop criticism of lobbying and corruption in <a href="PACE">PACE</a>.

The <a href="European%20Stability%20Initiative">European Stability Initiative</a> stated that “the ESISC report is full of lies” (for example, it was said in the report that PACE member Strasser had pro-Armenian views, because he visited Yerevan in 2015 in memory of the Armenian genocide, when Strasser has never been in the Republic of Armenia).

It is part of the municipality of <a href="Apollonioi">Apollonioi</a>.

Name, origin and meaning.
"Evgiros" means "nice aging". 

The naming is due to the wonderful year round climate, with low humidity, the benefit of having the sea close by, and the cool wind that blesses Evgiros even in the dog days of the summer.

The water is also very clean, coming directly from the hill above Evgiros.

A very high percentage of the villagers live to surpass 90 years of age, with some known to go above 100 years old.

Location, elevation.
Evgiros is situated on a hill in the south of Lefkada, at an elevation of 820 feet (250 meters).

The village has a beautiful view of the Afales Bay in <a href="Ithaca">Ithaca</a> and the northern part of <a href="Cephalonia">Cephalonia</a>, in particular <a href="Fiskardo">Fiskardo</a>. 

Evgiros enjoys a nice view of the Lefkas Lighthouse, with the cape Doukato, famous for being the spot from where the classic Greek female poet <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a> dared her suitors to try and soar if they tryuly loved her, and from there she is also said to have taken her life, by jumping on the white rocks below.

History, economy.
The first settlements in Evgiros are said to be from the Middle Ages.

Evgiros used to be one of the main villages on the Island, with a population of more than 900 as late as 1950.

The village was the center of its own municipality, with <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>' head as its symbol. The local school had more than 80 pupils.

The economy was based on olive and grapes crops, with the village operating 8 <a href="Oil%20mill">oil mills</a>. Goats and sheeps were bred for cheese, a staple of the local diet.

Two large areas were available for the crops and the herds, the "Campo" below the village, and the "Vounì" (dialect: small mountain) above it. 

Later on the families from Evgiros gave origin to the settlement of . Now a flourishing tourist resort, Sivota was born as a harbour for the fishermen, with a few wooden huts. 

In the second half of the 20th Century, challenging economic conditions brought along the <a href="Greek%20diaspora">Greek Diaspora</a>, with Evgiros being hit harshly. 

Many of the locals left for Athens, but more emigrated to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> or the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

World War II.
Evgiros was occupied by the Italians in 1940, and later, after the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">8th September</a> Armistice, by the Germans. Some of the former invading Italians were aided and hidden by villagers to protect them from the Germans, as Lefkas had its own small version of the <a href="Cephalonia%20Massacre">Massacre of Cephalonia</a>

Evgiros villagers were involved in the <a href="Greek%20Resistance">Resistance</a>, with the Germans burning many houses as a reprisal. 

To this day, the few surviving people speak of a somehow amicable occupation by the Italian Army, followed by two very hard years under German rule.

Population.
Current population in Evgiros is around 30 people year round. In the summer and the Holidays many of the people who left come back, and the village goes back in time, hosting some 200 people.

Politics.
Evgiros is part of the <a href="Apollonioi">Apollonioi</a> municipality. Every five years a representative of the Evgiros community is elected along with the Mayor of Apollonioi.

Currently the office is held By Spyros Fatouros, who has won the office four times running. 


Curiosities.
There are only three family names in Evgiros, mainly of Italian or Venetian origin
Married couples with the same last name are not uncommon. To sort out each family from the others sharing the same name, nicknames or "paratsouklia" have been established, and have stayed the same for generations. Many of these have funny, derogatory, or even obscure meanings.

With the introduction of the new league system, from Topklasse and Hoofdklasse to Tweede Divisie, Derde Divisie and Hoofdklasse, the number of spots for now the Derde Divisie was increased from 1 to 5.

As a result, the 10 teams are right away paired up to play a 1-round 2 leg knockout system. The 5 winners play next season in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Derde%20Divisie">2016–17 Derde Divisie</a> and the 5 losers in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Hoofdklasse">2016–17 Hoofdklasse</a>.

For details and results see <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Topklasse%23Derde%20Divisie%20/%20Hoofdklasse%20play-offs">2015–16 Derde Divisie / Hoofdklasse Promotion/relegation play-offs</a>.

Promotion/Relegation play-off Hoofdklasse - Eerste Klasse.
Saturday.
The teams ranked 11th and 12th of each of the 3 Saturday leagues (6 teams) and the 3 period winners of each of the 5 Saturday Eerste Klasse leagues (15 teams), making a total of 21 teams participate in the play-offs.

In previous years these 21 teams were split up into 7 groups of 3 teams each. The winner of each group would play next season in the Hoofdklasse and the remaining teams in the Eerste Klasse.

With the introduction of the new league system, from Topklasse and Hoofdklasse to Tweede Divisie, Derde Divisie and Hoofdklasse, the number of Hoofdklasse Saturday leagues was reduced from 3 to 2.

As a result, the 21 teams are not competing any more for 7 spots in the Hoofdklasse, but only for 3 spots.

To accomplish this, the 21 teams are first split into 3 groups of 7 teams each. All 7 teams in 1 group playing each othere would be to time consuming. Therefore, each group of 7 teams is split up further into 2 subgroups or poules. One poule of 4 and one poule of 3 teams. The split is made in such a way that there will be a team, which played this season in the Hoofdklasse, in each of the poules (6 total).

In the first round each poule will play a semi competition. In the poules with 3 teams, each team will play one match at home and one match away. In the poules with 4 teams, 2 teams will play two matches at home and one match away, and the other 2 teams will play only one match at home and two matches away.

In the second round, the 2 winners of the poules within a group decide which team will play next season the Hoofdklasse.

Sunday.
The teams ranked 11th and 12th of each of the 3 Sunday leagues (6 teams) and the 3 period winners of each of the 6 Sunday Eerste Klasse leagues (18 teams), making a total of 24 teams participate in the play-offs.

In previous years these 24 teams played in a 2-round 2 leg knockout system. The 6 winners of the second/final round would play next season in the Hoofdklasse and the remaining teams in the Eerste Klasse.

With the introduction of the new league system, from Topklasse and Hoofdklasse to Tweede Divisie, Derde Divisie and Hoofdklasse, the number of Hoofdklasse Sunday leagues was reduced from 3 to 2.

As a result, the 24 teams are not competing any more for 6 spots in the Hoofdklasse, but only for 2 spots. However, since the <a href="Topklasse">Topklasse</a> club <a href="WKE">WKE</a> went bankrupt and therefore their team didn't relegate to the Hoofdklasse, an extra spot became available. So the teams could compete for 3 spots.

To go from 24 to 3 teams the teams play a 3-round 2 leg knockout system. The teams are paired in a way that two teams, which played this season in the Hoofdklasse, can't meet until the final third round.

<doc id="54892507" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54892507" title="Strijp-S">
Strijp-S

Strijp-S is a neighborhood and former industrial park  in the  <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a> distrtict of <a href="Strijp">Strijp</a>. The area belonged to electronics company <a href="Philips">Philips</a>. Since 2000 creative companies and housing have been established in the former industrial buildings. <a href="Eindhoven%20Strijp-S%20railway%20station">Eindhoven Strijp-S railway station</a> serves the district.

Name.
The name Strijp-S comes from the naming pattern that Philips used in its industrial parks. Strijp-S was the first park, and Strijp-T and Strijp-R followed.

History.
Lamps, radios and televisions.
In <a href="1916">1916</a> <a href="Anton%20Philips">Anton Philips</a> built the first factory in Strijp-S a glass factory for <a href="Incandescent%20light%20bulb">incandescent light bulbs</a>. The <a href="Philips%20Natuurkundig%20Laboratorium">Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium</a> was completed in 1923. Strijp-S was where first radios, then televisions were invented and produced, as well as many other devices. The credo "Van zand tot klant" ("from sand to customer") stood behind the idea that Philips controlled every phase of production from research to storage, from glass blowing to cardboard factory: everything on one enormous piece of land.
Departure of Philips.
In the 1990s Philips gradually left Eindhoven and in 2000 the first discussions took place about the repurposing of Strijp-S. In <a href="2002">2002</a> the land was sold for €140 million to "Park Strijp Beheer B.V.", a public private partnership between the city of Eindhoven and VolkerWessels. Philips was able to lease some of the buildings back temporarily until its full withdrawal in 2006, although there are still two small Philips departments present in the buildings SFH en SEY.

Adaptive reuse and Strijp-S today.
Project for adaptive reuse.
With the departure of Philips the plans was implemented to make the area a broad destination for the creative sector, including technology and design, under the English headline "Old Buildings, New Ideas". The old factory buildings would be perfect for studios. In 2016 the creative school St. Lucas opened at Strijp-S.

Residential.
In 2012 Strijp-S got its first permanent residents, when the SAS-3 project was completed (new construction). A year later the repurposed industrial SAN en SBP buildings were ready for residential use. Lofts replaced former television factories. The buildings were renamed <a href="Gerard%20Philips">GERARD</a> and <a href="Anton%20Philips">ANTON</a>, in honor of two prominenta members of the Philips family. Many other residential complexes are planned such as <a href="https%3A//www.space-s.nl/">Space-S</a> and Blok 61, 63 and 59. Een jaar later zijn ook de industriegebouwen SAN en SBP klaar voor bewoning.

The profile of the residents skews very young, with 78.2% of the residents are between 20 and 34 versus 24.6% in Eindhoven as a whole.

Restaurants, cafés, bars.
In the Veemgebouw in 2015 the <a href="food%20hall">food hall</a> "Vershal Het Veem  "opened.

Arts and culture.
Art space MU and film house Plaza Futura are located at Strijp-S. 

De Ontdekfabriek is a children's science discovery space. The Chinees Paviljoen is under construction, with a theme of Chinese culture, a gift from the Chinese city of <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>.

Events.
Strijp-S is a major event space, in the halls of the Klokgebouw building, but also larger events on the Ketelhuisplein plaza. For example, dance festival Flying Dutch in 2015 attracted 25,000 visitors.  <a href="Dutch%20Design%20Week">Dutch Design Week</a> takes place each October. Every third Sunday of the month Strijp-S hosts the FeelGood Markt market.
Sports.
Strijp-S is a magnet for urban sports. Skateboarding, <a href="BMX">BMX</a> and <a href="bouldering">bouldering</a> as well as bootcamp classes.
Light Art.
Strijp-S is a place for experimentiation with <a href="Light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> lighting, which keeps the historic connection with Philips' past. Some <a href="light%20art">light art</a> includes the project Fakkel by Har Hollands. In the underground passage to NatLab artist <a href="Daan%20Roosegaarde">Daan Roosegaarde</a> installed his project Crystal.

Strijp-S is a regular location for the light festival <a href="GLOW%20Festival%20Eindhoven">GLOW</a>.

Skálholt Cathedral

Skálholt Cathedral (<a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a>: "Skálholtdómkirkjan") is a <a href="Church%20of%20Iceland">Church of Iceland</a> cathedral church. The church is the official church of the Bishop of Skálholt, currently Kristján Valur Ingólfsson. 

History.
Even though the cathedral contains the seat of the bishop, Skálholt is no longer a diocese with its own right. The <a href="Diocese%20of%20Sk%C3%A1lholt">Diocese of Skálholt</a> was dissolved in 1801 however it was re-established as a suffragan diocese in 1909. Thus the bishop is known as a suffragan bishop who assists the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Iceland">Bishop of Iceland</a>. Nonetheless, the Bishop of Skálholt is responsible for the cathedral affairs. 

The cornerstone of the present cathedral was laid in 1956 by Bishop <a href="Sigurbj%C3%B6rn%20Einarsson">Sigurbjörn Einarsson</a>. It was built between 1956 and 1963 to commemorate the 1000 years since the diocese was founded in 1056. The cathedral was consecrated in 1963. The cathedral was built on the site of all 9 previous churches that had stood on the exact site throughout the 1000 years since the establishment of the diocese. Excavations carried out on the site prior to the building of the cathedral proved this much. Excavations unearthed several headstones of various bishops of Skálholt including a stone coffin that included the remains of one of the bishops. 
Interior.
The cathedral contains a total of 25 stained glass windows made by Gerður Helgadóttir. They are designed in an abstract manner and depict Christian symbolism and some of the medieval bishops of Skálholt. The altarpiece is the work of Nína Tryggvadóttir amd depicts Christ coming into the cathedral with the landscape behind depicting Iceland. The pulpit dates from the <a href="17th%20century">17th century</a> and is the one used by Bishop <a href="Brynj%C3%B3lfur%20Sveinsson">Brynjólfur Sveinsson</a> in 1650.

Abisso Bonetti

Abisso Bonetti ("Bonetti Abyss") is a <a href="Karst">Karst</a> <a href="cave">cave</a> situated in the <a href="Comune">municipality</a> of <a href="Doberd%C3%B2%20del%20Lago">Doberdò del Lago</a> (<a href="Province%20of%20Gorizia">Gorizia</a>, <a href="Friuli-Venezia%20Giulia">Friuli-Venezia Giulia</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>), SE from the small village of "Bonetti", near <a href="Slovenia">Slovenian</a> border (village of "<a href="Nova%20Vas%2C%20Miren-Kostanjevica">Nova vas</a>"). The cave is one of the most famous cavities in the <a href="Province%20of%20Gorizia">Gorizia</a> <a href="Karst%20Plateau">Karst</a>. Anyway, due to its dangerous <a href="Pit%20cave">pit opening</a>, entry is allowed only to expert <a href="cavers">cavers</a> with the necessary <a href="Caving%20equipment">equipment</a> for <a href="Single-rope%20technique">single-rope descend</a>. 

Morphology.
Abisso Bonetti is one of the biggest and most well-known cavities in the <a href="Province%20of%20Gorizia">Gorizia</a> <a href="Karst%20Plateau">Karst</a>. It opens <a href="above%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>, on a small plateau north of Jamiano (<a href="Doberd%C3%B2%20del%20Lago">Doberdò del Lago</a>), near <a href="Slovenia">Slovenian</a> border. Overall, it is long and deep.

Peculiarity of the cavity is its impressive opening, a deep, for wide abyss, that's an open <a href="Pit%20cave">pit</a> in direct connection with the external environment. The cave has an other entrance, that's a partially artificial gallery connected with the pit. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> built a shelter in the gallery. The bottom part of the open pit contains a rubble slope where <a href="detritus">detritus</a>, <a href="Plant%20material">plant materials</a> and <a href="Carrion">animal carrions</a>, fallen down from the external environment, are collected. The innermost part of the cave is made up of an underground gallery after that, passing through a tight passage, a big hall is reached. The hall contains collapsed <a href="Bedrock">bedrocks</a> and <a href="cave%20formations">cave formations</a>, including a <a href="Stalagnate">column</a> that seems like holding up the weight of the ceiling.

Abisso Bonetti shows a <a href="Climate">climatic</a> pecularity. The innermost part of the cave has a stable <a href="temperature">temperature</a> (, that's the annual mean temperature in the place where the cave opens), a typical feature of cavities. Anyway, in the bottom part of the open pit, temperature varies between in <a href="summer">summer</a> and in <a href="winter">winter</a>. This part of the cave can be considered a <a href="Ice%20cave%23Temperature%20mechanisms">cold trap</a>.

History.
During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, between <a href="1916">1916</a> and <a href="1917">1917</a>, <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> used the cave as a shelter and as a field hospital, and adapted it through opening a new entrance in the gallery next to the pit. Because of the present of a number of <a href="pigeons">pigeons</a>, <a href="Austro-Hungarians">Austro-Hungarians</a> called the cave "Taubenloch Höhle" or "Taubenschlucht" ("Pigeons Hole"). The same name (<a href="Slovene%20language">Slovene</a>: "Golobinka") was also used by <a href="Slovenian%20people">Slovenian people</a> living in the area. In the spring of 1917, <a href="Italian%20Army">Italian Army</a> occupied the whole area and used the cave as a shelter. In <a href="1946">1946</a>, the "Rastrellatori" ("<a href="bomb%20disposal">bomb disposal</a>") unit extracted a number of <a href="Explosive%20remnants%20of%20war">explosive remnants</a> of war from the cave. However, some remnants of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> can be find in the cave yet.

In addition to the military use, the cave has drawn <a href="Speleology">speleologists</a>' attention. The first <a href="Cave%20survey">survey</a> of the cavity was realised by <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> Italo Garibotti (SAG) on January <a href="1923">1923</a>. The survey was reviewed by Ugo Stocker (Gruppo Speleologico <a href="Monfalcone">Monfalconese</a>) on 16 June <a href="1968">1968</a>. During last decades, many speleology schools have used the cave in their first-level courses.

Since the 80s, scientist has carried out a number of botanical, zoological and geological studies and researches in the cave.

The fauna.
Abisso Bonetti represents one of the four localities where the <a href="ground%20beetle">ground beetle</a> "<a href="Typhlotrechus">Typhlotrechus bilimeki tergestinus</a>", a <a href="Troglobite">troglobious</a>, <a href="Depigmentation">depigmented</a> and <a href="Anophthalmia">anophthalmic</a> <a href="Predation">predator</a> species, can be observed. Other species hosted in the cave are <a href="Subterranean%20fauna">cave dwelling species</a> typical of the <a href="Karst%20Plateau">Karst area</a>. <a href="Troglobites">Troglobites</a> include the <a href="spider">spider</a> "<a href="Mesostalita">Mesostalita nocturna</a>", the <a href="Woodlouse">woodlouses</a> "Alpioniscus strasseri" and "Androniscus stygius", and the <a href="round%20fungus%20beetle">round fungus beetle</a> "Bathysciotes khevenhulleri tergestinus". Troglophiles include the <a href="millipede">millipede</a> "<a href="Polydesmidae">Brachydesmus subterraneus</a>", two <a href="centipede">centipede</a> <a href="Lithobiidae">lithobid</a> species, the <a href="cave%20cricket">cave cricket</a> "Troglophilus neglectus", the <a href="moth">moth</a> "<a href="Triphosa%20dubitata">Triphosa dubitata</a>", the <a href="fly">fly</a> "<a href="Limonia%20nubeculosa">Limonia nubeculosa</a>" and a unidentified <a href="phorid%20fly">phorid fly</a> species, the <a href="ground%20beetle">ground beetle</a> "<a href="Laemostenus">Laemostenus cavicola</a>", and the <a href="Rove%20beetle">rove beetles</a> "Atheta spelaea" e "Quedius mesomelinus""." In addition, <a href="Bat">bats</a> (in particular the <a href="greater%20horseshoe%20bat">greater horseshoe bat</a> "Rhinolophus ferrumequinum") and <a href="Bird">birds</a> (e.g. some specimen of <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny owl</a>) use the first part of the cavity as a refuge.

The bottom part of the open <a href="Pit%20cave">pit</a> hosts a number of <a href="trogloxene">trogloxene</a> <a href="Insect">insects</a>, <a href="Spider">spiders</a>, <a href="Amphibian">amphibians</a> and <a href="Reptile">reptiles</a>. In <a href="summer">summer</a>, these animals are attracted by low <a href="temperature">temperature</a> and <a href="humidity">humidity</a> coming from the pit and fall down. However, if they survive the fall, they stay trapped and cannot return to the external environment.

Early life and education.
Born in 1954, John Godfrey Taft was raised in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>. Taft and his two brothers are grandsons of <a href="US%20Senator">Senator</a> <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert A. Taft</a> and great-grandsons of former <a href="United%20States%20President">United States President</a> <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a>. Their father <a href="Taft%20family">Horace Dwight Taft</a> worked as dean of <a href="Yale%20College">Yale College</a>. After graduating from the <a href="Taft%20School">Taft School</a> in <a href="Watertown%2C%20Connecticut">Watertown, Connecticut</a> in 1972, Taft graduated in 1977 from <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> <a href="summa%20cum%20laude">summa cum laude</a>. 

By 1977, after working as a copy boy with the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>", Taft furthered his career as a newspaper reporter in <a href="Lowell%2C%20Massachusetts">Lowell, Massachusetts</a>, where he spent several years "covering the rebuilding of Lowell." Developing an interest in urban redevelopment and the financing of community projects, he then attended graduate school at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> in New Haven to learn about finance. 

Career.
In 1981 he entered the investment industry, moving to <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and taking a public finance position with the regional brokerage firm <a href="Piper%20Jaffray">Piper Jaffray</a>. With Piper Jaffray, he spent ten years helping a variety of clients, including governments, finance projects for public use. The city of <a href="St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">St. Paul, Minnesota</a> was among his clients, and Taft spent two years working for the <a href="Mayor%20of%20St.%20Paul">Mayor of St. Paul</a>.

After serving as managing director at Piper Jaffray, he went on to become president, CEO, and chairman of Voyageur Asset Management, the asset-management business of Dougherty Financial Group. Voyageur was sold to and became a unit of the brokerage firm <a href="Dain%20Rauscher%20Wessels">Dain Rauscher</a>, a regional brokerage firm. 

RBC Wealth Management.
The <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>-based <a href="Royal%20Bank%20of%20Canada">Royal Bank of Canada</a> (RBC) acquired <a href="Dain%20Rauscher">Dain Rauscher</a> in 2001. Taft was appointed to a management role at RBC, becoming head of asset management and products for RBC’s United States and international division. 

Returning to Minneapolis, Taft became CEO of RBC's US retail brokerage arm, RBC Wealth Management US.

Under Taft, RBC Wealth Management avoided major financial difficulties in the <a href="2008%20financial%20crisis">2008 financial crisis</a>, and its <a href="assets%20under%20management">assets under management</a> increased 60% between 2008 and 2011, to $220 billion. In an effort to allow the unit's financial advisors to dedicate more time to clients, between 2008 and 2011 Taft "boosted RBC's annual technology spending by 50%," and encouraged advisors to work in teams. 

Recent.
After advocating for the addition of banking and lending to RBC's capabilities in the United States, in November 2015 he helped facilitate RBC's acquisition of <a href="City%20National%20Bank%20%28California%29">City National Bank</a> for $5.4 billion. The merger added "banking and lending capabilities to the firm’s advisor force." By early 2016 Taft's unit of 1,900 financial advisors was overseeing $273 billion of assets. 

Taft retired as CEO of RBC Wealth Management on May 31, 2016. Since 2016 he has been chairman of Delaney|Taft LLC.

Memberships and committees.

Active on the Itasca Project, his past directorships include <a href="United%20Way">United Way</a>, <a href="Minnesota%20Public%20Radio">Minnesota Public Radio</a> (MPR), and <a href="Twin%20Cities%20PBS">Twin Cities PBS</a> (TPT). 

In 2011 he served as chairman of the <a href="Securities%20Industry%20and%20Financial%20Markets%20Association">Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association</a> (SIFMA).

Writing and speaking.
Books.
On August 3, 2012, Taft published his first book, "Stewardship: Lessons Learned From the Lost Culture of Wall Street." Endorsed by former <a href="US%20Representative">US Representative</a> <a href="Barney%20Frank">Barney Frank</a>, the book focused in part on the financial crash of 2008, with Taft also advocating for stewardship in the financial industry.

Through <a href="St.%20Martin%27s%20Press">St. Martin's Press</a>, on March 17, 2015 he published "A Force for Good: How Enlightened Finance Can Restore Faith in Capitalism". Taft wrote the introduction and edited the book, which includes 20 essays by individuals in business or finance such as <a href="John%20Bogle">John Bogle</a>, <a href="Sheila%20Bair">Sheila Bair</a>, <a href="Mary%20Schapiro">Mary Schapiro</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Shiller">Robert Shiller</a>. The essays cover topics such as "creating a stable retirement system, rebuilding investor trust, and using investment strategies that help protect the environment." As summarized by "<a href="Wealth%20Management">Wealth Management</a>", the book "pulls together commentary from industry leaders… to discuss how the financial services industry can harness its power for the public good."

Op-eds and speaking.
Taft's <a href="op-eds">op-eds</a> have been published in magazines and newspapers such as "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>’’.

In his op-ed and talks, he often covers topics such as <a href="corporate%20responsibility">corporate responsibility</a>, trends in the <a href="banking%20industry">banking industry</a>, and the state of modern <a href="American%20politics">American politics</a>. 

Supportive of the rights of transgender and gay employees, when <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> considered a ballot to ban same-sex marriage in late 2012, Taft made appearances in media sources such as "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" to speak against the ballot.
In 2013 he criticized the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>'s use of United States' sovereign debt as political leverage for being "the heights of irresponsibility." 

In 2015 he gave the keynote speech at the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, where he advocated for sustainable business practices and investments. In 2009, Taft testified before the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Financial%20Services">United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee</a> in favor of a fiduciary standard of care for professionals, when providing financial advice to individuals. However, in early 2016, "<a href="Wealth%20Management">Wealth Management</a>" reported that Taft had been fighting against attempts to "apply the... fiduciary standard to brokers" by the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Labor">US Department of Labor</a> (DOL), with Taft arguing that the DOL's version of the <a href="Dodd-Frank%20Act">standard</a> would not work for the brokerage industry. Taft advocated that such a standard should instead by written by the <a href="US%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) due to their experience with financial markets.

Recognition.

Jenaer Liederhandschrift

The Jenaer Liederhandschrift (German, the "Jena song manuscript") is a 14th-century manuscript containing lyrics and melodies to songs in <a href="Middle%20High%20German">Middle High German</a>. The majority of the lyrics belong to the genre of <a href="Spruchdichtung">Spruchdichtung</a> and, with 91 melodies, the manuscript is the single most important source for the music of this genre.

It is currently held in the <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>n , <a href="Jena">Jena</a>, with the shelf-mark Ms. El. f. 101. In <a href="Minnesang">Minnesang</a> scholarship it is referred to as Manuscript J. A further fragment, consisting of a single sheet, is in the Studienbibliothek in <a href="Dillingen">Dillingen</a> (XV Fragm. 19).

Description.
The manuscript comprises 133 (of an original 154) folios and contains collections of lyrics by 31 named poets, along with an anonymous religious song (a <a href="Lai">Leich</a>), and the text of the "<a href="S%C3%A4ngerkrieg">Wartburgkrieg</a>" ("The song-contest at the Wartburg").

The quality of the manuscript is exceptional:

The unusual size of the manuscript, 56 by 41 cm, the outstanding quality of the parchment, the careful, almost monumental execution of the penmanship in both text and music suggest an aristocratic patron who wished to own a song collection with melodies in a luxurious edition. 

Of the melodies, Bernoulli notes, "On the whole we cannot imagine a more clearly written example of a document using <a href="square%20notation">square notation</a>."

For these reasons, it seems likely that the manuscript was commissioned for display (or possibly as a gift) rather than for use in musical performance.

History.
The manuscript was compiled in about 1330 in <a href="Central%20Germany">Central Germany</a>, possibly <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a> for an unknown high-status patron, though it has been suggested it was for <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Meissen">Frederick the Serious</a>, Landgrave of Thuringia and Margrave of Meissen or <a href="Rudolf%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Wittenberg">Rudolf I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg</a>. By 1540 it was located in <a href="Wittenberg">Wittenberg</a>, where it was bound, and in 1549 was transferred as part of the Wittenberg Bibliotheca Electoralis ("<a href="Prince-elector">Elector</a>'s library") to the Collegium Jenense in Jena,which later became the <a href="University%20of%20Jena">University of Jena</a>.

The Dillingen fragment is a single sheet, half of a folio that was removed from J (between the current folios 132 and 133) sometime before the latter was bound in 1541. It was used as a binding for a collection of religious tracts and was first discovered in 1917. 

The Poets.
The manuscript contains songs by the following poets, who are mostly of <a href="Central%20German">Central German</a> origin. Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of melodies for each poet.

The first mentions of the church occur in the Norwich <a href="Taxatio%20Ecclesiastica">Taxatio Ecclesiastica</a> of 1254 and the Lincolnshire Taxatio of 1291. The South chamber and the door of the tower may both date from this time. The "particularly fine enriched roofs" are later, dating from re-modellings in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Jesse window, the church's most famous feature, dates from 1533. The window is reputed to have been removed and buried during the <a href="English%20Civil%20war">English Civil war</a> to protect it from destruction. It was re-instated in 1661. The church suffered at the hands of <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> restorers; Arthur Baker's restoration of 1879-80 is described as "indifferent" by <a href="Cadw">Cadw</a> and as "inappropriate" in the <a href="Pevsner%20Architectural%20Guides">Clwydd</a> volume of "The Buildings of Wales".
The church remains an active parish church within the Mission Area of Denbigh. 

Architecture and description.
The church is constructed of <a href="limestone">limestone</a> <a href="rubble">rubble</a> with <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> <a href="Ashlar">dressings</a> and slate roofs.

The architectural historian <a href="Edward%20Hubbard">Edward Hubbard</a> notes the style as <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Perpendicular</a>, with the possible exception of the tower door.

The interior contains a "wonderfully complete" <a href="Tree%20of%20Jesse">Tree of Jesse</a> window, described by Cadw as "the <a href="apogee">apogee</a> of the early <a href="Tudor%20era">Tudor</a> North Wales school of <a href="Glazing%20%28window%29">glazing</a>". The window, showing <a href="Jesus">Jesus's</a> descent from <a href="Jesse">Jesse</a>, has been called "the finest Glass window in all Wales, exceeded by few in England". 

The church also contains a number of significant monuments to local <a href="grandees">grandees</a> including those of Watkin Edwards Wynne and Maurice Jones, the latter "large and <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a>, (a) reclining bewigged effigy".

Vietnamese nationalists and anti-communists say the treaty guaranteed China to annex Vietnam at 2020, and granted historical distortion by Vietnam's Communist Party, the only sole Party in Vietnam, although it is not proved.

Battle of Antioch (1098)

The Battle of Antioch (1098) was a military engagement fought between the forces of the <a href="Crusades">Crusaders</a> of <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> and a <a href="Turkish%20People">Turkish</a> coalition lead the <a href="Emir">Emir</a> <a href="Kerbogha">Kerbogha</a> of <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a> as a part of the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>. Kerbogha's goal was to reclaim Antioch from the Crusaders and affirm his position as a regional power.

The Conflict Begins.
As the Crusaders emerged from the gates of Antioch, divided into six regiments, Kerbogha's <a href="Arab%20People">Arab</a> commander, <a href="Watthab%20ibn%20Mahmud">Watthab ibn Mahmud</a>, urged him to immediately strike their advancing line. However, Kerbogha was concerned a preemptive strike might only destroy the Crusader's front line and may also significantly weaken his own forces disproportionately. However, as the Franks continued to advance against the Turks, Kerbogha began to grasp the severity of the situation (he previously underestimated the size of the Crusading army), and attempted to establish an embassy between him and the Crusaders in order to broker a truce. However, it was too late for him, and the leaders of the Crusade ignored his emissary. 

Battle Maneuvers.
Kerbogha, now backed against a corner by the advancing Franks, opted to adopt a more traditional Turkish battle tactic. He would attempt to back his army up slightly in order to drag the Franks into unsteady land, while continuously pelting the line with horse archers, meanwhile making attempts to outflank the Franks. However, <a href="Bohemond%20I%20of%20Antioch">Bohemond</a> was ready for this, and he created a seventh division of Crusaders leads by <a href="Rainauld%20of%20Toul">Rainauld of Toul</a> to hold off the attack. Soon, many Emirs began to desert Kerbogha. Many of the Crusaders were also encouraged by the presumed visions of <a href="St.%20George">St. George</a>, <a href="Saint%20Maurice">St. Maurice</a>, and <a href="Saint%20Demetrius">Saint Demetrius</a> among their ranks. Finally, <a href="Duqaq%20of%20Damascus">Duqaq of Damascus</a> deserted, spreading panic among the ranks of the Turks. <a href="Soqman%20the%20Ortoqid">Soqman the Ortoqid</a> and the <a href="Emir">Emir</a> of Homs, <a href="Janah%20ad-Daula">Janah ad-Daula</a>, were the last loyal to Kerbogha, but they too soon deserted after realizing the battle was lost. The whole Turkish army was now in complete disarray, all fleeing in different directions; the Crusaders chased them as far as the Iron Bridge, slaying many of them. Kerbogha would go on to return to <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a>, defeated and stripped of his prestige.

The heavy- and medium-duty models had been discontinued by 1975 as the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20NG">Mercedes-Benz NG</a> range took over, while the lighter portion of the range was only replaced in 1984, by the new LK ("Leichte Klasse", "light class").

History.
The new LP range first appeared in 1963, along with a new naming system for Mercedes-Benz trucks as well as a new engine generation. Common for all variants were strong mechanics but an unfortunate reputation for rusting quickly. Some of the early trucks equipped with the new engines also suffered problems, but these were soon rectified. The cabin was designed to maximize interior space, with a low engine hump, and with large windows all around.

The naming of the trucks followed Mercedes-Benz' new naming strategy: the leading one or two digits signified the <a href="gross%20vehicle%20weight%20rating">gross vehicle weight rating</a>, with the last two digits representing the maximum power in tens of horsepowers (with a leading zero if necessary). Thus, an LP608 has a total max weight of and an engine producing , while the LP 1632 is a truck with about . The LP range proved a strong seller, with an increase of German sales for Mercedes-Benz in the heavy truck segment of 153 per cent between 1965 and 1973.

Light duty.
The light duty cabin, first introduced in 1965, was used for trucks with <a href="Gross%20vehicle%20weight%20rating">GVW</a>s ranging from . These LPs can most easily be distinguished by their low-line grilles, with headlights mounted inside. As with all of the Cubic cabs, they did not have a tilting cabin, both to save costs and to make it more safe in crashes. A series hatches and doors were to provide access, but the trucks were complicated to service. Only a short daycab was on offer, although independent bodybuilders were at hand to provide any other layouts. The first version introduced was the LP 608, equipped with the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20OM314%20engine">OM 314</a> diesel engine. There was also a version, as well as ones. In 1969 nine-tonners appeared, fitted with the six-cylinder OM 325 engine with either . The LP 608 was also the first truck to leave the production line in Daimler-Benz newly constructed plant in <a href="W%C3%B6rth%20am%20Rhein">Wörth</a>. 

In 1977 the light range was thoroughly modernized, with a smoothed out cabin and a new grille. The headlights were now mounted below the body, in the front bumper. A version with an air-sprung rear axle was also added. The cabin remained fixed, in a segment where most competitors had moved on to tilting cabs. New ten and eleven tonne models were added, while the output of the smallest OM 314 engine crept up to . The light portion of the range outlived its heavier brethren, remaining in production until 1984.

Medium duty.
The medium-duty models in the range had <a href="Gross%20vehicle%20weight%20rating">GVWs</a> between . A different door arrangement was shared with the heaviest part of the range, while the grille was taller. The headlamps were mounted in the lower half of the grille. Introduced in 1965, it was fully replaced by the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20NG">Mercedes-Benz NG</a> in 1976. In 1965 a longer cabin with room for two berths was also introduced. The non-tilting cabin required a large number of hatches and doors for access to the mechanical parts, which earned the model the less than flattering nickname "<a href="Advent%20calendar">Advent Calendar</a>." The lighter models received the 5675 cc six-cylinder OM 325 engine with either , while the heavier ones received the 7980 cc OM 327 with .

When the heavier range was facelifted in 1970, the middleweights received mechanical upgrades and new weight ratings, but the appearance remained mostly the same. Some more powerful engines were also introduced, as in the LP 1519's 8720 cc OM 360 with .
Heavy duty.
The heavy-duty models were the first to be introduced, in late 1963. They have <a href="Gross%20vehicle%20weight%20rating">GVWs</a> between . Their cabin is similar to that of the later middleweight trucks, although the oval headlamps were mounted in the bumper beneath the body. They were fairly spartanly equipped, in praticular the absence of a suspended seat. Mercedes-Benz countered with a suspended cabin, but this was often not enough to provide driver comfort in practice. Much of the technology was adapted from the preceding L/LP series, including the OM 326 diesel straight-six. In 1964 this was replaced with the all-new OM 346 <a href="Fuel%20injection%23Direct%20injection">direct injection</a> diesel, an engine that ran smoother and was more durable (after some early problems). Outputs soon crept up to and then to to meet new regulations which took effect on 1 May 1965. An overall weight of for tractor-trailers coupled with the minimum 6 PS/tonne (max 373 lb/hp) made this necessary.

From 1 January 1972, the minimum power requirement increased to 8 PS/tonne (max 280 lb/hp). Mercedes-Benz responded with a new generation of diesel engines in a <a href="V%20engine">V-layout</a>. These, however, required a tilting cabin and thus the heavy trucks were finally thus equipped. A V10 OM 403 was enough for the heaviest loads, while a <a href="V8%20engine">V8</a> was perfect for the category. The 1970 LP-series received new doors that went down deeper, eliminating the exposed steps and many of the various hatches. The roof was higher, and the front turn signals moved outwards so as to be visible from the sides of the truck. The smaller versions continued with the old cab. The heaviest models featured a lot of parts that were developed for the succeeding <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20NG">New Generation</a> trucks, and are sometimes called the "Between Generation" ("Zwischen-Generation"). Towards the end of production of the V10 trucks, they received newly developed planetary axles as the earlier designs could not quite handle the V10's torque.

Coimbatore - Chamrajnagar line

The Coimbatore - Chamrajnagar line is a proposed railway line from <a href="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a>(Tamilnadu) to <a href="Chamrajnagar">Chamrajnagar</a>(Karnataka). It is a part of <a href="Southern%20Railway%20zone">Southern Railway zone</a> of <a href="Indian%20Railways">Indian Railways</a>. This line upon construction will improve rail connectivity of western Tamilnadu with Karnataka.This line would give direct rail connectivity between coimbatore and mysore and will reduce the travel distance to Mysore and Banglore.It will also connect Tamilnadu with southern districts of Karnataka.

History.
During British Rule several surveys were done in 1922, 1936 and 1942 and survey stones were also laid for the proposed railway line.But after Independence the scheme did not take off and was rejected later amid concerns over destruction of forests and wildlife.During Pawan Kumar Bansal's Tenure He Announced in railway budget that ministry revived an old proposal to lay a broad-gauge railway line through the dense forests of Chamarajnagar-Sathyamangalam-Mettupalayam. In his speech, Bansal said the proposal was neglected for long because of the lack of environmental clearance. To justify his decision to revive the project, Bansal said the Karnataka government had expressed its willingness to meet 50% of the construction cost along with providing the required land free of cost. 
Ironically, the minister made this announcement just after he expressed anxiety over the growing elephant deaths due to speeding trains. During the first half of his speech, the minister said railways would work along with the Union ministry of environment and forests to find strategies to avert collision involving trains and elephants. 
"The project was shelved following strong public protest as they believed it would wipe out the elephant population in Sathyamnagam.Even though the minister claimed to have Karnataka's support, Tamil Nadu remains silent about the fact that the proposed route would pass through Sathyamangalam and Mettupalayam forests, which constitutes the elephant corridor linking western and eastern ghats. 
Five years ago, chief engineer-construction (west) of south western railway approached Central Empowered Committee of the Supreme Court seeking permission for the Tamil Nadu forest department to conduct a feasibility survey for the railway line. But the permission was not granted. 
As per railways own admission, the proposed railway line would pass through 58 km of dense forest area in Tamil Nadu and even the survey work involves the felling of trees. A document prepared by railways says the railway line will come under the Nilgiris eastern ghat elephant reserve, part of the Nilgiris biosphere reserve and proposed Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.' 
The proposed railway line will pass through erstwhile Veerappan territories like Talavadi, Gattawadi and Bannari. Around a dozen conservation groups in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu fear that the project could cause enormous destruction to the sandalwood forests and Asiatic elephants of the region. 
Along with other conservation groups and Karnataka, the Tamil Nadu Green Movement is planning to approach the Supreme Court, as the proposed line would divide the only contiguous elephant habitat spread across 15,000 km in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. 
Now, if the new railway line comes through, large tracts of forests from the north-eastern slope.
However, railway sources claim the new line would directly connect north western Tamil Nadu with economically advanced regions of Karnataka including Bangalore, Mysore, Mandya, Mangalore and Hassan, besides boosting transportation in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. According to railways, they have no alternative to the dense forests of Sathyamangalam.

Route.
The revived proposal was initially prepared way back in 1915 to link Palani with Chamrajanagar. It was planned via Kangeyam, Erode, Gobichettipalayam and Sathyamangalam.The British had conducted surveys in 1922, 1936 and 1942 and survey stones were also laid for the proposed railway line.Later the proposal was changed.The proposed railway line will pass through reserve forest areas like Satyamangalam forest,Nilgiri hills.Places in between
chamrajnagar and coimbatore like Talavadi,Gattawadi,Bannari,Satyamangalam,Gobichettipalayam,Erode,Mettupalayam will be connected through this line.On completion, the railway line would have 277 bridges, 138 curves and 61 tunnels. There have been suggestion for laying railway line without destruction of forest.one of the suggestted route is Sathyamangalam, Pulliyampatti, Avnashi, Tirupur (Vanjipalayam) or Tirupur. From Vanjipalayam line can be connected to Tirupur to Coimbatore main line.Another suggestion is through Sathyamangalam, Annur, Karamadi.From Karamadi, Mettupalayam - Coimbatore main line can be used to connect with coimbatore.

Ecological concerns.
Conservation biologists and ecologists have raised concerns about the ecological impact on the proposed railway line. Over 58 km of the railway line passing through the Sathyamangalam tiger reserve and Nilgiri biosphere reserve will mean wildlife mortality due to railway collision almost on daily basis.

Economic factors.
The new line would directly connect north western Tamil Nadu like Coimbatore,Tiripur,Erode,Nilgris,karur with economically advanced regions of Karnataka including Bangalore, Mysore, Mandya, Mangalore and Hassan, besides boosting transportation in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.The proposed line will reduce the travel time to mysore and banglore more than half of the time taken in current route.

Werdau station

Werdau station is a station on the <a href="Leipzig%E2%80%93Hof%20railway">Leipzig–Hof railway</a> in <a href="Werdau">Werdau</a> in the German state of <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>. Until 2000, the <a href="Werdau%E2%80%93Mehltheuer%20railway">Werdau–Mehltheuer railway</a> branched off here, but this section of the line is now closed.

History.
The station was opened in 1845. Traffic on the line south of the station ran over the <a href="Werdau%20wye">wye junction</a> towards <a href="Reichenbach%20im%20Vogtland">Reichenbach im Vogtland</a>, <a href="Hof%2C%20Bavaria">Hof</a>, <a href="Munich">Munich</a> and the <a href="Allg%C3%A4u">Allgäu</a> as well as towards <a href="Zwickau">Zwickau</a>, <a href="Chemnitz">Chemnitz</a> and <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>. It is one of the oldest railway stations in Saxony.

The branch line to <a href="Werdau%E2%80%93Mehltheuer%20railway">Wünschendorf</a>, also called the "Thüringer Waldbahn" (Thuringian Forest Railway), was opened in 1876. A new station building was opened in 1877 and it was extended in 1907. It has a stuccoed dining room, railway apartments, a luggage handling facility and a railway post office, as well as houses for the station staff.

Around 1900, the station was rebuilt and the route to Wünschendorf changed. Instead of connecting to the station from the south, it now entered from the north, connecting to the Leipzig–Hof railway at a <a href="flying%20junction">flying junction</a> with a track of the line to Wünschendorf built above the Plauen–Leipzig line.

Werdau became a rail junction, an important center with a locomotive depot (<a href="Bahnbetriebswerk">Bahnbetriebswerk</a>) and a carriage works. There was also a locomotive shed. Werdau became a leading industrial city.

Passenger traffic to Wünschendorf was discontinued in 1999. Subsequently, some facilities were dismantled. The flying junction north of the station was removed, a road bypass was built without abridge over the path of the railway, so the line is now broken between Werdau West and Werdau. 

An <a href="electronic%20interlocking">electronic interlocking</a> was put into operation in 1999. 

The historic station, which was partly renovated up to 2003, will become a stop for public transport in 2017. The monument protection of the station was lifted in 2016. Many citizens have signed a petition to preserve the station. The civic association "Wir in Werdau Süd e.V." ("We in Werdau South"), which stands for the preservation of Werdau station was founded in 2016.

In the 2017 timetable, services to Werdau will be replaced by lines S5 and S5X of the <a href="S-Bahn%20Mitteldeutschland">S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland</a> (Halle (Saale) Hbf–Zwickau (Sachs) Hbf) and line R2 operated by the <a href="Die%20L%C3%A4nderbahn">Vogtlandbahn</a> (Zwickau (Sachs) Hbf–Cheb). The trains of the R2 service will reverse in Werdau to continue their journeys.

Infrastructure.
The tracks are accessed through the historic railway station. In 2000, direct railway access to platform 1, the Werdau–Mehltheuer railway platform, was removed and the other platforms (tracks 1–4, now only having access through the station hall) were modernised. Before the modern development, access to the railway tracks was also possible directly from the street. New doors, windows, floors, false ceilings, a disabled toilet, a new heating system, a new ticket vending machines as well as a renovated retail area in the former luggage storage area were built up to 2000.
Connections.
Werdau has bus stops in front of the historic station building. Daily, three or four buses stop next to the footpath in front of the station entrance. Buses can also stop in front of the former dining room. There are also several large covered bus stops, as well as a covered taxis area just in front of the historic station.

There are about 50 parking spaces at the station building. State road 289 is to the west of the station, but it is not directly accessible.

175th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery

175th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (175th HAA Rgt) was an air defence unit of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> formed during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It served in defence of the vital naval and air base at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>.

Origin.
175th HAA Regiment was formed in October 1942 by taking an experienced battery from each of three existing Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) regiments of <a href="Anti-Aircraft%20Command">Anti-Aircraft Command</a>:

Training.
The new Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) was attached to <a href="46th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">46 AA Bde</a> at <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, but in early November its three batteries were still scattered around the country: 375 HAA Bty attached to <a href="60th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">60 AA Bde</a> in South West England, 386 to <a href="1st%20Anti-Aircraft%20Group%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1 AA Group</a> in London and 441 still with 55 AA Bde. In December the regiment with its batteries now concentrated was transferred to <a href="63rd%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">63 AA Bde</a> in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, where AA Command units were often sent for training. In April 1943 the regiment left AA Command and came under <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> control, preparatory to proceeding overseas.

Gibraltar.
On 23 May 1943, 175th HAA Rgt, with 375, 386 and 441 HAA Btys, arrived in Gibraltar from the United Kingdom to relieve <a href="82nd%20%28Essex%29%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">82nd (Essex) HAA Rgt</a>. It came under the command of <a href="15th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">15 AA Bde</a>, and 228 HAA Bty from the recently disbanded <a href="13th%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">13th HAA Rgt</a> was attached to it. On 25 August 228 HAA Bty left Gibraltar and was relieved by 596 HAA Bty transferred from <a href="177th%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">177th HAA Rgt</a> in the UK.

The vital <a href="Port%20of%20Gibraltar">naval base</a> and <a href="RAF%20Gibraltar">airfield</a> on Gibraltar had been overflown and sometimes attacked by <a href="Vichy%20French%20Air%20Force">Vichy French</a>, <a href="Regia%20Aeronautica">Italian</a> and <a href="Luftwaffe">German</a> aircraft during 1940–42, and the AA defences had reached peak strength in early 1943. Ironically, after 175th HAA Rgt arrived there were only two or three reconnaissance overflights during 1943. By the end of the year, with Italy out of the war and the German forces in Italy in retreat, it was clear that the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a> could no longer mount an effective air strike against Gibraltar. A reduction in the AA defences began in order to release men urgently needed elsewhere.
In February 1944 the rundown started with the disbandment of 15 AA Bde HQ, overall command of the AA defences passing to the fortress's HQ <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>. On 7 March RHQ of 175th HAA Rgt took over operational control of 451 LAA Bty from <a href="141st%20Light%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">141st Light AA Rgt</a> which was being withdrawn, together with 1 RDF Bty (radar), 1 AA 'Z' Troop (<a href="Z%20Battery">Z Battery</a> rocket launchers) and 142 Gun Operations Room. Then on 20 August 596 HAA Bty and 1 AA 'Z' Trp left Gibraltar. By September there were only 16 operational HAA guns in the fortress, the remainder being in a state of care and maintenance only. Finally, on 26 October, 451 LAA Bty was disbanded and 1 Radar Bty became independent; there were no other changes to the end of the war.

Postwar.
In the postwar reorganisation of the Royal Artillery, RHQ of 175th HAA Rgt was redesignated 113 HAA Rgt (replacing the disbanded <a href="113th%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">113th HAA Rgt</a>) on 1 April 1947, with 375 HAA, 386 HAA and 441 (now LAA) Btys becoming 328, 329 and 330 HAA Btys. But on 1 May 1947 the regiment was disbanded, retroactive to 1 April 1947.

Islam in the Cook Islands

Islam in the Cook Islands is a small religious minority in the <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> dependency of the <a href="Cook%20Islands">Cook Islands</a>. It's not exaclty clear how many Muslims are there in the Cook Islands, because the calculation of Muslims doesn't participate in the country census.

Library of Veliko Tarnovo

Library of Veliko Tarnovo is the third biggest library in <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>.

History.
Old Bulgarian Library in Tarnovo.
In several of the Tarnovo churches, during the centuries of the Ottoman rule, many valuable books and manuscripts from the Second Bulgarian State were kept and manuscripts related to the Bulgarians under Ottoman domination. According to some legends, after the conquest of Turnovo, the books and manuscripts were hidden in the Patriarchal Church of St. Peter and Paul. According to legends, besides manuscripts and books, the library has escaped royal letters and contracts, living and psalteries. All of them were clearly inscribed and richly decorated with miniatures. Hellenic bishop who made them burned. 
There was an Old Bulgarian Library in Tarnovo, which was burnt down in 1872.

"Petko R. Slaveykov" Regional National Library.
There was an Old Bulgarian Library in Tarnovo, which was burnt down in 1872. 

"Petko R. Slaveikov" National Library - Veliko Tarnovo was opened as a Third National Library after the <a href="Metropolitan%20Library%5D%20and%20the%20%5BIvan%20Vazov%5D%20National%20Library">Metropolitan Library] and the [Ivan Vazov] National Library</a>. The idea of ​​opening a library in Tarnovo is by Stilian Chilingirov, who was then the director of the Library in Sofia. The library opened on 15 August 1922 and was originally housed in the Angel Popov building. The first director of the cultural institution is Mosko Moskov. A plan for the construction of the library building has been prepared. A plot of land is selected for which 13 yards are alienated. Most owners donate their land free of charge. The total amount of land is 600 000 leva. A complex is being built, which will house a museum and a library. The construction began in the 1940s. The library was renamed to the Regional Methodological Library - Veliko Tarnovo in 1953. The building is made by arch. Angel Damianov. It was renamed to the Petko Rachov Slaveikov National Library in 1958. In 1979 the Library Department's Methodology department grew into the Libraries Directorate at the Regional Council for Culture in Veliko Tarnovo and managed the Territorial Library System. In 1971, the library was awarded the Cyril and Methodius Order I in the 50th anniversary of its creation. The Regional Library collaborates with the city of Linz.

<doc id="54893319" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54893319" title="Southern Pacific Garbage Patch">
Southern Pacific Garbage Patch

The Southern Pacific Garbage Patch is an area of elevated levels of <a href="marine%20debris">marine debris</a> and plastic particle pollution, most of which is concentrated within the ocean's <a href="pelagic%20zone">pelagic zone</a>. It is located within the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Gyre">South Pacific Gyre</a>, which itself spans from waters east of <a href="Australia">Australia</a> to the <a href="South%20America">South America</a>n continent, as far north as the <a href="Equator">Equator</a>, and south until reaching the <a href="Antarctic%20Circumpolar%20Current">Antarctic Circumpolar Current</a>. The degredation of plastics in the ocean also leads to a rise in the level of toxins in the area. This garbage patch is the most recently discovered having only been confirmed in mid-2017. The South Pacific garbage patch has been compared in nature to the <a href="Great%20Pacific%20Garbage%20Patch">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a>'s state in 2007, making the former ten years younger. The garbage patch is impossible to detect using satellites, or other visual means as most particles are smaller than a grain of rice.

Discovery.
Evidence pointing to the existence of a garbage patch in the South Pacific gyre was discovered in early-2011 and it's existence was confirmed in mid-2017. The discovery was made after a research voyage made by the <a href="5%20Gyres">5 Gyres</a> Institute, led by Executive Director, Dr. Marcus Erikson. This voyage marked the first time the South Pacific Gyre had been sampled for plastic pollution. From March to April 2011, following a route based on a model of ocean currents developed by Nikolia Maximenko, of the <a href="University%20of%20Hawaii">University of Hawaii</a>, which predicts floating debris accumulation zones. The expedition started taking samples off the coast of <a href="Robinson%20Crusoe%20Island">Robinson Crusoe Island</a>, Chile, and began working its way west, collecting a new sample each 50 nautical miles, reaching the waters off <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>, and eventually <a href="Pitcairn%20Island">Pitcairn Island</a>.

A second water sampling voyage departing from <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a>, launching November 2, 2016 and lasting approximately six months was led by Oceanographer and Captain <a href="Charles%20J.%20Moore">Charles J. Moore</a>, and a team of volunteer researchers from Algalita Marine Research and Education, an organization which he founded.Upon departure the vessel began it's journey south along the <a href="Baja%20California%20peninsula">Baja California peninsula</a> and on to the <a href="Galapagos%20Islands">Galapagos Islands</a>, continuing southwest on to <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>. After departing Easter Island the crew then headed eastward to the <a href="Juan%20Fernandez%20Islands">Juan Fernandez Islands</a>, after which it continued north following the coast of <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, with stopping points at <a href="Antofagasta%2C%20Chile">Antofagasta, Chile</a>, and <a href="Arica%2C%20Chile">Arica, Chile</a>, before heading further out to sea for it's return journey to Long Beach.

Composition, concentration and size.
During the 5 Gyres expedition, 48 samples were taken from a 2,424 nautical sweep. The researchers found an increase in plastic pollution density, averaging 26,898 particles per square kilometer, but spiking at up to 396,342 particles per square kilometer, peaking near the center of the predicted accumulation zone, with some estimates as high as one million particles per square kilometer.

The composition of the garbage patch consists mainly of <a href="microbead">microbead</a>s, tiny abrasives less than 5 micrometers in size usually found in certain personal hygiene products, microscopic fibers from washing clothes, fishing debris from southern hemisphere fishermen,and microscopic fragments of larger pieces which have been broken down in the ocean.

The elevated levels of pollutants can be detected over a vast area estimated to be 2.6 million square kilometers (one million square miles), or about 1.5 times the size of <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, with the debris found along a nearly 2,500 nautical mile straight line route. 

Effects on marine life and the ocean.
As the plastic particles are primarily found in the pelagic layer of the ocean they experience high levels of <a href="Photodegradation">Photodegradation</a>, which causes the plastics to break down into ever smaller pieces. These pieces eventually become so small that even <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s can ingest and metabolize them converting these plastics into <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. In some instances these <a href="microplastics">microplastics</a> absorb directly into a microorganisms' biomolecules.However, before reaching this state any number of organisms could potentially interact with these plastics. During their expedition in 2016-17, Charles Moore and Algalita found that more than 35% of south Pacific <a href="Lanternfish">Lanternfish</a> had consumed plastic particles. When ingested by the fish the chemical compounds found in these plastics cannot be digested. This can effect Humans as the Lanternfish is a food source for both <a href="salmon">salmon</a> and <a href="tuna">tuna</a>.In their PNAS journal, Dr Van Sebille and his colleagues report data showing that in 1960 less than 5% of seabirds were found to have consumed waste material, while as of August of 2015 that figure climbed to about 90%. It is predicted that by 2050, 99%of seabirds will have consumed such materials.Scientists studying the stomach contents of <a href="Laysan%20Albatross">Laysan Albatross</a> chicks report a 40% mortality rate before fledgling. When the stomach contents were analyzed following necropsies, they were found to contain plastic waste. Not only do plastic pellets used in manufacturing worldwide absorb toxic chemicals such as <a href="DDT">DDT</a> and <a href="Polychlorinated%20biphenyl">PCBs</a> from the water, but can even leach chemicals such as <a href="biphenyl">biphenyl</a>. It is estimated that up to 267 marine species are effected by plastic pollution.

Researchers led by chemist Katsuhiko Saido, a graduate from <a href="Nihon%20University">Nihon University</a>'s College of Pharmacy in Japan have collected seawater samples worldwide, including from waters of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, and <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. All samples collected were found to contain <a href="polystyrene">polystyrene</a> derivatives. Polystyrene is a plastic found in <a href="styrofoam">styrofoam</a> and many household and consumer goods. The scientists then simulated the decomposition of polystyrene in the open ocean. The results of this simulation showed that polystyrene, which begins breaking down at temperatures of 86° and higher. As it does so it breaks down into harmful chemicals, such as <a href="Bisphenol%20A">Bisphenol A</a> (BPA), which can cause reproductive harm in animals, <a href="styrene%20monomer">styrene monomer</a>, a suspected <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>, and styrene trimer, a by-product of polystyrene.

One study study shows estimates of 5.25 trillion individual pieces of microplastcs, weighing nearly 267,000 tons are currently floating in our oceans.It has been estimated that since being invented, 8.3 billion tons of plastics has been produced, with 80% (6.64 billion tons) being dumped in landfills, on land, and in the oceans. Plastic particles don't biodegrade or break down and instead just fragment into smaller pieces. If current trends in the amount of plastics flowing into our oceans continues, combined with <a href="overfishing">overfishing</a>, will result in plastics outweighing fish in the oceans by 2050.

It´s the first Venezuelan metal band, only with bass and drums.

History.
Its members are the brothers Arcuri: Felipe (bass player of the Venezuelan heavy metal band Arkangel, one of the most legendary and successful bands in the Latin American rock scene) and Vicente (drummer of the Venezuelan heavy metal band Gillman), who in 2002, founded an experimental project, originally called Black Rainbow, the first metal band in Venezuela, only with bass and drums, replacing guitars with bass guitar, and adding electronic sequences executed under the <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> environment. That year, they had a unique performance at the Festival Nuevas Bandas (a musical contest that features newborn bands of different genres from all over the country), capturing the attention and applause of the audience, but the project remained in pause, due to the multiple commitments of the Arcuri brothers with their other activities. Meanwhile, they kept accumulating experience, rehearsing and creating themes. 

From 2011, the project, initially called Black Rainbow, evolves and happens to be call Arcuri Overthrow, and they recorded several singles, compiled in an EP called "Inicio", with the participation of some Latin American rock stars, between them: <a href="Elkin%20Ram%C3%ADrez">Elkin Ramírez</a> singer of Colombian hard rock band <a href="Kraken%20%28band%29">Kraken</a>, and Hugo Bistolfi keyboardist of Argentine heavy metal band <a href="Rata%20Blanca">Rata Blanca</a>.

SHARP neural network

The acronym SHARP stands for Systolic Hebb Agnostic Resonance Perceptron.

The novel neural network model has been presented the first time in 2015, by <a href="http%3A//www.synaptics.org/ABOUT.htm">Luca Marchese</a>, at WIRN - 25th Italian Workshop on Neural Networks - <a href="http%3A//www.associazionesiren.org/home/default.asp">Societa Italiana Reti Neuroniche (SIREN)</a> - International Institute for Advanced Scientific Studies (IIASS).

The SHARP model is neural fuzzy classifier inspired by the architecture of the cerebral cortex.

The first part of the acronym “SHARP” stands for “Systolic Hebb” and refers to the learning rule applied to synapses on resonating neurons in a sequential flow. The second part stands for “Agnostic Resonance Perceptron” and refers to the perceptron-like multilayer architecture, where the capability of the neurons in each layer to resonate to a specific value of a feature is “agnostic” because it is not related to previously learned patterns.

The most important characteristics of the neural network are:

The architecture of the network is a three-dimensional matrix (FIG.1) for which the three dimensions represent, respectively, a mini-column, a macro-column and a cortical area network. Each minicolumn is linked with a specific feature of the input stimulus and contains neurons resonating with specific values of the feature. The RF neurons in the mini-column are competitive modules (CM) working with a controlled WTA (Winner Takes All) mechanism. A macro-column is composed of mini-columns linked through synaptic connections that build paths representing configurations of the learned input patterns.
The input vector distance from the stored prototype is measured using the BOX-distance with extreme flexibility because the influence field of a single vector component (one side of the Hypercube) can be different for any component (FIG.2).

Big Wood Brewery

Big Wood Brewery is a brewery and taproom located in <a href="White%20Bear%20Lake%2C%20Minnesota">White Bear Lake, Minnesota</a>, in the <a href="Minneapolis-St.%20Paul">Minneapolis-St. Paul</a> area. The company began in some empty warehouse space in <a href="Vadnais%20Heights">Vadnais Heights</a> in 2009, before moving into their newly built brewery in 2012.

History.
In 2009, Steve Merila began to brew beer in some of the empty warehouse space which his wood flooring distribution business was not using. The original intent was to serve the beer at wood flooring seminars Merila held. Additionally, he began to offer beer to customers at his store. There was a bookshelf in his office which rotated out of the wall, revealing a small lounge with a couch and a bar. Jason Medvec joined Merila during Minnesota's "Winterfest" in February 2011. As the beer began to develop a following, it was decided to start their own brewery, called Big Wood Brewery due to their history in the wood flooring industry. Slightly later in 2011, they hired their first professional brewer, Ty McBee. Their first official beer was a stout, "Morning Wood", which won "best beer" at the regional Autumn Beer Review (which it won again in 2012). Their two biggest sellers are "Jack Savage" (an <a href="American%20Pale%20Ale">American Pale Ale</a>) and "Bad Axe" (a seasonal <a href="India%20pale%20ale">Imperial IPA</a>). Other beers include "Wicked Ex" (another IPA), Weissenheimer" (a <a href="Wheat%20beer">wheat ale</a>), and "Bark Bite" (IPA). In 2012 the brewery was named "#1 Minnesota Brewery at the <a href="Beer%20festival%23United%20States">St. Paul Summer Beer Fest</a>. When they began looking for a location to expand their operations and move it out of the warehouse space, the decision was to move to White Bear Lake, where they would be the only local brewery. They selected a century old building in which to house their brewing operations, as well as open a taproom.

In 2013 Big Wood began to offer four of its products – Jack Savage, Morning Wood, Bark Bite, and Bad Axe - in 16 ounce aluminum cans, as a way to expand their market. The brewery moved from its warehouse location to its current address in White Bear Lake at the beginning of 2013. In February 2014, the brewery opened their taproom to the public, and along with dozens of other local breweries, they are part of a campaign by both Explore Minnesota (the Minnesota Department of Tourism) and the Minnesota Craft Brewers Guild to promote, "brewcations", which highlight tours of those breweries. The taproom was constructed using materials recovered from historic area buildings and barns, as well as from trees downed in storms. In 2016 the brewery began a "Taproom Series" of craft beers, where they release a previously taproom-only beer every three months, in both bottles and kegs. The premier offering in the series was "FINE!", an IPA.

In 2017, their "Chocolate Chip Cookie Beer" was selected as one of the craft beers to be served at the <a href="Minnesota%20State%20Fair">Minnesota State Fair</a>. The brewery's beers and ales can be found in bars and liquor stores throughout Minnesota and eastern Wisconsin.

<doc id="54893762" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54893762" title="The Index Card">
The Index Card

The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn't Have to Be Complicated is a <a href="personal%20finance">personal finance</a> book written by <a href="Helaine%20Olen">Helaine Olen</a> and <a href="Harold%20Pollack">Harold Pollack</a> in 2016. The book is based on advice written on an <a href="index%20card">index card</a> by Pollack in 2013.

Background.
In April 2013, Pollack interviewed Olen about her book "Pound Foolish", and metaphorically mentioned "that the best [financial] advice for most people would fit on an index card". Pollack further said that "if you're paying someone for advice, almost by definition, you're probably getting the wrong advice because the correct advice is so straightforward."

Emails and coomments on his <a href="blog">blog</a> asked for a real index card with financial advice, so Pollack jotted down nine rules in two minutes, took a picture of it, and posted it online. The image went viral, and was covered on many internet news sites. Pollack and Olen wrote "The Index Card" three years later, which Pollack compares with the original index card as <a href="midrash">midrash</a> to the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>.

Content.
Olen and Pollack suggest investing in <a href="diversification%20%28finance%29">diversified</a> <a href="mutual%20fund">mutual fund</a>s, paying one's entire <a href="credit%20card">credit card</a> <a href="balance%20%28accounting%29">balance</a> each month, having a <a href="financial%20advisor">financial advisor</a> commit to a <a href="fiduciary%20standard">fiduciary standard</a>, and using <a href="Roth%20IRA">Roth</a>, <a href="SEP-IRA">SEP</a> and <a href="529%20plan">529</a> accounts. The book and index card also contain some "simple" advice, such as saving 10 to 20 percent of one's income, maxing out a <a href="401%28k%29">401(k)</a>, and not buying individual <a href="security%20%28finance%29">securities</a>. They also include more "subtle" advice on how to choose and interact with a financial advisor. The book has rules about buying a home and insurance, topics they felt were left out from the first list.

Reception.
The book received a 3.86/5 average rating on <a href="Goodreads">Goodreads</a>, and 4.2/5 on <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a>.

Both the book and image both received criticism about the last rule, a social safety net, saying that it was more political than financial. Pollack says "that the American taxpayer had [his] back when [he] had a crisis," and he "should be doing the same thing for other people," referring to the time when he and his wife took care of his intellectually disabled brother-in-law. He also received emails about his original card from people who couldn't save the 20% he suggested, so he lowered the number to 10% in the book.

John Palmer (1807 ship)

John Palmer was built at Plymouth in 1807. There is a missing decade (1807-1817) during which she is absent from "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" and the "Register of Shipping". From 1818 on she is traceable as she traded with India and South America. In 1823 new owners purchased her and she became a <a href="whaler">whaler</a>, making five voyages between 1823 and 1841, when she was broken up.

Merchantman.
"John Palmer" first appears in the registers in 1818 (there being no registers published in 1817), having undergone a "thorough repair" and having received <a href="copper%20sheathing">copper sheathing</a> over boards in 1817. Her master is Saunders, her owner Marsh & Co., and her trade London—India. She then sailed in 1819 to <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a> under a license from the British <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>. She left Mauritius on 23 April 1821, bound for the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>.

She left <a href="Port%20Louis">Port Louis</a>, Mauritius, on 26 April 1822, and arrived at the Cape of Good hope on 29 May. On 18 May she had seen a sunken boat and debris near it. The suspicion was that the vessel was "Brougham", which had sailed from Port Louis with a cargo of wheat two weeks before "John Palmer".

After that voyage "John Palmer" started trading with South America.

Whaler.
"<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" for 1823 shows her "John Palmer"s master changing from Saunders to Clark, and her trade from to London—South Seas. It also shows her as having undergone a "good repair" in 1823. "Lloyd's Register" for 1824 shows that her owner was now (Benjamin) Rotch and her master W. Clark.

Whaling voyage #1 (1823-1826).
Captain J. (or Elisha) Clark sailed from England on 3 September 1823, bound for the South Seas fishery. "John Palmer" left Madeira on 11 October. She was reported to be at the Sandwich Islands on 11 October 1824 with 900 barrels of oil. She is next reported to have left Honolulu on 15 November 1825. She returned to England on 4 July 1826 with 700 casks of <a href="sperm%20oil">sperm oil</a>.

In 1826 Clark became the first European to sight <a href="Onotoa">Onotoa</a>, in the <a href="Gilbert%20Islands">Gilbert Islands</a>.

Whaling voyage #2 (1826-1829).
Captain Clark sailed from England on 23 September 1826, bound for the South Seas. "John Palmer" was at Madeira on 9 October, and at Tahiti by 9 December. She was at the Sandwich Islands between 25 October 1828 and 22 November. leaving with 1200 barrels. She then was at Tahiti again in December. "John Palmer" returned to England on 10 April 1829 with 650 casks.

On 23 October 1827, "John Palmer" was at <a href="Lahaina%2C%20Hawaii">Lahaina, Hawaii</a>. There local women came on board and bartered sexual favors for goods, in violation of the local government's prohibition of such activities. When Clark took a boat ashore, Maui Governor <a href="Hoapili">Hoapili</a>, responding to concerns of <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> living there, seized Clark and the sailors manning the boat. Hoapili agreed to release the men on the understanding that Clark would land the women at Lahaina. Instead, Clark sailed off, firing five 9-pounder shots over the house of the missionary <a href="William%20Richards%20%28Hawaii%29">William Richards</a>, as he went. Richards and his wife took shelter in the basement. Hoapili then built the <a href="Old%20Lahaina%20Fort">Old Lahaina Fort</a> in 1831 to protect the town from riotous sailors.

Whaling voyage #3 (1829-1833).
Captain Clark sailed from England on 21 July 1829, bound for the South Seas fishery. In late 1831 she had 1000 barrels. In November she was off Japan with 131700 barrels. She was at Honolulu between 19 November and 2 December. She was at Mowee (Maui) on 24 April 1832. She April she had 1850 barrels, and then was again at Honolulu on 1 November 1832 with 2500 barrels, and then on 12 November at Maui. She was at Tahiti on 7 January 1833, and returned to England on 18 May with 610 casks. 
Whaling voyage #4 (1833-1837).
One source reports that Captain Kemp sailed from England on 30 January 1834, bound for Timor. She was at <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> on 16 February 1837 with 2400 barrels.

However, a more detailed report has "John Palmer" being repaired in the East Country Dock, London, in the autumn of 1833, and having her timbers and sails treated with "Kyan's Patent Process", a process for protecting wood from decay that <a href="John%20Howard%20Kyan">John Howard Kyan</a> had patented in 1828. She then sailed 13 December, not returning until 22 April 1837. Her master was R. Pattenden Lawrence. The occasion of the report was an investigation, and testimonial, for the efficacy of Kyan's wood treatment.

Whaling voyage #5 (1837-1841).
Captain R. Pattenden Lawrence sailed from England on 21 July 1837, bound for Timor and the seas off Japan. In February 1838 she was at Timor, and on 20 May at the <a href="Bonin%20Islands">Bonin Islands</a> (Ogasawara Islands), where two of her men deserted. She was at Guam on 19 October 1839 and the Bonin Islands again on 10 May. On her second visit, one of the men who had deserted rejoined her. By 26 February 1840 she had 2300 barrels. She visited <a href="Kupang">Copang</a> to cooper 2100 barrels. "John Palmer" was at St Helena between 13 and 28 December with 2600 barrels. She returned to England on 13 February 1841

Fate.
On her return from her last voyage "John Palmer" was broken up. Her entry in "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" for 1841 has the notation "Broken up".

The stelle is now in the <a href="Stele%20Forest">Stele Forest</a> or Beilin Museum (碑林; pinyin: Bēilín) in Xi'an, China. Richard Joseph Smith discusses both maps in his "Mapping China and Managing the World: Culture, Cartography and Cosmology in Late Imperial Times".

The Hua Yi Tu map references back to the 801 Chia Tan (scholar and cartographer) map (Heinei Hua I T’u [Map of China and the Barbarian Countries within the (Four) Seas]) presented to <a href="Emperor%20Dezong%20of%20Tang">Emperor Dezong of Tang</a>. The later Hua Yi Tu map covers China during the Nan <a href="Song%20Dynasty">Song Dynasty</a>. The 12th century map depicts mountains, rivers, lakes, as well as more than 400 administrative place names of China. It includes Korea in the west of Pamier area, from north to the Great Wall, northeast to Heilongjiang region, to the south of Hainan Island. The texts arranged around the edges of the graphic part of the map provides information from historical and other sources briefly explaining markers such as the Great Wall, the size of the empire, and the states to the west.

He then transitioned his business to focusing on marketing rather than products, and had some early successes, including the sale of a DIY kit for potato guns. As he developed his marketing systems, he termed his tools “sales funnels”. During the year following his graduation from college he was making about $1 million per year through his businesses. He later founded several other businesses, including CitySmart.com and DotComSecrets.com.

<doc id="54894153" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54894153" title="Cold North Killers: Canadian Serial Murder">
Cold North Killers: Canadian Serial Murder

Cold North Killers: Canadian Serial Murder is a 2012 Canadian non-fiction book written by <a href="Lee%20Mellor">Lee Mellor</a> and published by <a href="Dundurn%20Press">Dundurn Press</a>. It documents the lives of sixty Canadian <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a>s, with the earliest being <a href="Edward%20H.%20Rulloff">Edward H. Rulloff</a> and the most recent being <a href="Russell%20Williams%20%28criminal%29">Russell Williams</a>. The book uses <a href="Katherine%20Ramsland">Katherine Ramsland</a>'s interpretation of what constitutes a serial killer—someone who has killed at least two people on two separate occasions, and who attempted to or likely would have killed again—as outlined in her 2007 book "The Human Predator". "Cold North Killer's" own definition of what constitutes a Canadian serial killer includes both Canadians who committed murder abroad (such as <a href="Keith%20Hunter%20Jesperson">Keith Hunter Jesperson</a> and <a href="Wineville%20Chicken%20Coop%20Murders">Gordon Stewart Northcott</a>) and non-Canadians who committed murder in Canada (like William Dean Christenson and <a href="Earle%20Nelson">Earle Nelson</a>).

Background.
While bedridden with illness in 2009, Mellor occupied his time by writing a novel about an <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">RCMP</a> <a href="Offender%20profiling">criminal profiler's</a> hunt for a serial killer terrorizing Canada, but partway into the story, Mellor realized that he had very little knowledge of any actual Canadian serial killers beyond <a href="Clifford%20Olson">Clifford Olson</a>, <a href="Paul%20Bernardo">Paul Bernardo</a>, <a href="Karla%20Homolka">Karla Homolka</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Pickton">Robert Pickton</a>. While looking up other cases, Mellor, inspired by both the lack of a single comprehensive source regarding serial murder in Canada and the high-profile arrest of <a href="Russell%20Williams%20%28criminal%29">Russell Williams</a> in 2010, decided to abandon his original idea for a book in favor of new one, an encyclopedia about serial homicide in Canada.

Mellor researched seventy-five cases for the book, but at the behest of the editors at <a href="Dundurn%20Press">Dundurn Press</a> reduced the number of them included in it to sixty due to spatial constraints. Mellor later included two of the excised cases—the <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> child murders of 1981-92 and the "<a href="Nahanni%20National%20Park%20Reserve">Headless Valley</a>" murders 1908-46—in the third issue of his <a href="online%20magazine">online magazine</a> "Serial Killer Quarterly".

Synopsis.
Each of the book's four sections cover different aspects of serial murder, and are divided into chapters that are each about a different Canadian serial killer. In-between each section are passages relating to <a href="Russell%20Williams%20%28criminal%29">Russell Williams</a>, who was active and arrested in the same area where Mellor was residing while he was in the process of writing "Cold North Killers".

The first section showcases four of Canada's earliest serial killers—<a href="Edward%20H.%20Rulloff">Edward H. Rulloff</a>, Joseph LaPage, <a href="Theodore%20Durrant">Theodore Durrant</a>, and <a href="Wineville%20Chicken%20Coop%20Murders">Gordon Stewart Northcott</a>—and then delves into the <a href="nature%20versus%20nurture">nature versus nurture</a> debate by scrutinizing the lives of Russell Johnson, Doug Moore, <a href="Peter%20Woodcock">Peter Woodcock</a>, and <a href="Clifford%20Olson">Clifford Olson</a>. <a href="Modus%20operandi">Modus operandi</a> and <a href="signature%20crime">signature crime</a> are then discussed by looking into the crimes committed by <a href="L%C3%A9opold%20Dion">Léopold Dion</a>, <a href="William%20Patrick%20Fyfe">William Patrick Fyfe</a>, <a href="Earle%20Nelson">Earle Nelson</a>, Serge Archambault, Sam Pirrera, and William Dean Christenson, with <a href="victimology">victimology</a> then being explored through examination of <a href="John%20Martin%20Crawford">John Martin Crawford</a>, Donald Sherman Staley, and <a href="Allan%20Legere">Allan Legere</a>, as well as the unsolved Toronto gay village murders of 1967-68 and the <a href="Highway%20of%20Tears%20murders">Highway of Tears murders</a> of 1969-2011.

The next section begins with a focus on the three different categories of serial killer: organized, <a href="Disorganized%20offender">disorganized</a>, and mixed (someone who displays both organized and disorganized traits). Angelo Colalillo and David Threinen are used as examples of organized offenders, Braeden Nugent and Carl Hall as examples of disorganized offenders, and Donald Armstrong and Danny Wood as examples of mixed offenders. Next, sub-categories are explored, beginning with "<a href="Serial%20killer%23Visionary">visionary</a>" killer <a href="Peter%20Woodcock%23Imprisonment">Bruce Hamill</a> followed by "<a href="Serial%20killer%23Mission-oriented">missionary</a>" killer Ronald Sears, and then the three varieties of "<a href="Serial%20killer%23Hedonistic">hedonist</a>" killer; Henry Williams and Christian Magee are presented as instances of "hedonist-<a href="Lust%20serial%20killers">lust</a>" killers, James Greenidge and <a href="Michael%20Wayne%20McGray">Michael Wayne McGray</a> as "hedonist-<a href="Thrill%20killing">thrill</a>" killers, and <a href="insurance%20fraud">insurance fraud</a>sters Charles Kembo and Sukhwinder Dhillon, "black widow" <a href="Melissa%20Ann%20Shepard">Melissa Ann Shepard</a>, and <a href="Baby%20farming">baby farmers</a> <a href="Lila%20and%20William%20Young">Lila and William Young</a> as "hedonist-<a href="Serial%20killer%23Comfort%20%28profit%29">comfort</a>" killers. After chapters on "<a href="Serial%20killer%23Power/control">power/control</a>" killers David Snow and <a href="Keith%20Hunter%20Jesperson">Keith Hunter Jesperson</a>, the section concludes with passages on "<a href="Angel%20of%20mercy%20%28criminology%29">angels of death</a>" <a href="Thomas%20Neill%20Cream">Thomas Neill Cream</a> and Robert MacGregor.

The third section centers around techniques that are used by the authorities to help them investigate serial killers. <a href="Offender%20profiling">Offender profiling</a> was employed in the Brian Arp, <a href="Paul%20Bernardo">Paul Bernardo</a>, and the still-unsolved Edmonton serial killer cases, while advances in DNA analysis resulted in cold case murders being positively attributed to Ronald West, <a href="Gerald%20Thomas%20Archer">Gerald Thomas Archer</a>, and Alan Craig MacDonald. Crime-solving methods pioneered by Canada are then showcased; <a href="metal%20detector">metal detector</a>s were used to uncover Michael Vescio's discarded shell <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">casings</a> in what was the first instance of the devices being used to assist with a criminal investigation, while bite-mark analysis was used to help convict <a href="Wayne%20Boden">Wayne Boden</a> in what was one of the earliest usages of <a href="forensic%20dentistry">forensic dentistry</a> in North America. In 1998, <a href="Kim%20Rossmo">Kim Rossmo</a> used <a href="geographic%20profiling">geographic profiling</a> to discern the presence of a serial killer operating in Vancouver's <a href="Downtown%20Eastside">Downtown Eastside</a>. Rossmo's data, which the <a href="Vancouver%20Police%20Department">Vancouver Police Department</a> refused to look into, was later vindicated by the arrest of <a href="Robert%20Pickton">Robert Pickton</a> in 2002.

The first half of the book's final section is dedicated to discussing violence against Canadian sex workers, and how many of their deaths seemingly go unreported and under-investigated, possibly due to both their profession and the fact that many of them are <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Canada">Aborogine</a>. The cases examined here are all unsolved ones, and include the <a href="Hemlock%20Valley%20Resort">Hemlock Valley</a> murders of 1995, the Calgary prostitute murders of 1991-93, the Prostitutes-in-the-Lake killings of 1994-97, and the Niagara prostitute murders of 1995-2006. The second half of the section presents six cases (<a href="Karla%20Homolka">Karla Homolka</a>, Allan Sweeney, Melvin Stanton, Paul Cecil Gillis, Michael Hector, and <a href="Gilbert%20Paul%20Jordan">Gilbert Paul Jordan</a>) that Mellor regards as having been notably "botched" in some way, such as through investigative, judicial, or bureaucratic incompetence, apathy, or <a href="red%20tape">red tape</a>. The concluding chapter consists of brief write-ups on Noel Winters, Allan George Foster, Paul Alan Hachey, Raymond Russell, Donald Falkner, Davey Mato Butorac, Camille Cleroux, <a href="Cody%20Legebokoff">Cody Legebokoff</a>, and Mark Garfield Moore, all offenders who did not receive longer entries in the book due to either a lack of easily accessible information about their crimes, or because the murders that they committed were only unearthed while the book was undergoing its final editing phase.

Controversy.
The <a href="Vancouver%20Public%20Library">Vancouver Public Library</a> sent their copy of "Cold North Killers" to the hate-speech squad at the <a href="Vancouver%20Police%20Department">Vancouver Police Department</a> for analyses in 2013 after receiving complaints about its content from a concerned citizen, who wrote, "There is no educational benefit in introducing a 10-year-old child who might pick this book up... to the ideas contained in it." The authorities concluded that there was nothing illegal about the book's content, and the Vancouver Public Library subsequently issued the formal statement, "This work is disturbing to read, but this does not affect the library's obligation to protect the right of a citizen to read this book."

The Human Surge

The Human Surge () is a 2016 <a href="experimental%20film">experimental film</a> directed, shot, written and edited by the Argentine director <a href="Eduardo%20Williams">Eduardo Williams</a>. It is Williams' first <a href="feature%20film">feature film</a>, after a number of shorts. "The Human Surge" is structured into three separate narrative and geographical segments: one in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, the second in <a href="Maputo">Maputo</a>, Mozambique, and the third in <a href="Bohol">Bohol</a>, Philippines.

Each narrative segment follows a handful of characters, who are often seen <a href="loitering">loitering</a> or moving between spaces, such as <a href="workplace">workplace</a> and home. The segments are linked with <a href="diegetic">diegetic</a> bridges. Williams has stated that he wanted to explore the sensation and feelings related to aimlessness and travel, and thereby "create a rhythm between excitement and boredom or surprise and depression." The characters depicted in the three segments are invariably poor, restless and on the search for connection with other human beings.

The film premiered at the <a href="Locarno%20Film%20Festival">Locarno Film Festival</a> in 2016, where it won the "Concorso Cineasti del Presente" (Filmmakers of the Present). It was subsequently released at film festivals in <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Festival">New York</a> to critical acclaim. Comparisons have been made to other filmmakers working in the <a href="slow%20cinema">slow cinema</a> subgenre, where emphasis is made on the durational aspect of film, rather than its narrative qualities.

Plot.
In Buenos Aires, the 25-year-old Exe is seen waking up and getting dressed. He wades through a flooded neighbourhood to get to his workplace at a warehouse store, only to be fired from his position. He subsequently spends time loitering with his friends, visiting online <a href="cybersex">sex chat</a> rooms. They perform sex acts, like <a href="fellatio">fellatio</a>, on each other in front of a <a href="web%20camera">web camera</a> for money.

The movie moves on to the next segment through the window of a <a href="Chaturbate">Chaturbate</a> website, in which a group of African teenagers in Maputo, Mozambique are also seen engaging in <a href="cybersex">cybersex</a> for money. The Mozambique characters are also unemployed and empoverished, and perambulate through the streets between odd jobs and social events.

One character is found urinating on an <a href="anthill">anthill</a>, whereupon the film moves to the third segment, by following ants moving further into the earth, and finally arriving at a hand holding a <a href="smartphone">smartphone</a> in a jungle somewhere in <a href="the%20Philippines">the Philippines</a>. The camera follows a couple of characters bathing together and walking through the jungle, before arriving at a technological factory in <a href="Bohol">Bohol</a>, where <a href="tablet%20computer">tablet computer</a>s are made on an <a href="assembly%20line">assembly line</a>. The movie ends with a mechanical voice repeatedly saying "Okay."

Production.
Williams (born 1987) had made six short films, in which he experimented with different video formats and textures. In the short films "Pude ver in Puma" (eng. "Could See a Puma", 2011) and "Tôi quên rôi!" (eng. "I forgot!", 2014), he and his usual <a href="director%20of%20photography">cinematographers</a> Joaquin Neira and Julien Guillery experimented with different aesthetic strategies—notably the use of long, handheld <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a>s (often described as "floating" and "restless"), <a href="amateur%20photography">amateur photography</a>, as well as <a href="ellipsis%20%28narrative%20device%29">elliptical storytelling</a>—which they further developed for "The Human Surge".

For "The Human Surge", Williams used three types of video formats, one for each segment: the Argentine segment was shot on <a href="16%20mm%20film">16 mm film</a>, the Mozambique part with a <a href="Blackmagic%20Design">Blackmagic</a> pocket camera—subsequently recaptured in <a href="16%20mm%20film%23Super%2016%20mm">Super 16</a> from a computer monitor, and the final Philippine sequence on a digital <a href="RED%20camera">RED camera</a>.

In the short films he had started his career with, Williams had regularly employed a domestic Argentine setting. However, in the latest shorts—"That I'm Falling?" (2013) and "I forgot!" (2014)—he opted for different locales, travelling to <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, respectively. Having travelled abroad only very rarely as a young man, Williams was struck by the beauty of foreign languages, eventually also discovering a charm in vernacular, spoken Spanish.

Analysis.
The film has been analysed for its commonalities with other entries in Williams' oeuvre, most notably the themes of alienation in the <a href="internet%20age">internet age</a>, and how modern technology creates distance between people.

Picking up on the theme of <a href="internet%20psychology">internet psychology</a>, critic Nick Pinkerton praises Williams' ability in addressing "the enormous cognitive earthquake represented by the internet’s colonization of daily life".

Several critics have found certain organizational elements within the film and, by extension, Williams' oeuvre. Leo Goldsmith of "Cinema Scope" has called Williams' work a "cinema of <a href="vector">vector</a>s", noting the constant geographical and <a href="ontological">ontological</a> displacement throughout his films. Ambulatory passages are frequent in Williams' cinema, where (often young) characters are seen moving through dilapidated apartments, supermarkets, areas of <a href="urban%20decay">urban decay</a>, jungles, rocky hillsides and caves. The novelty in "The Human Surge" lies in its movement from literal/concrete places (anthill) to abstract/figurative places (internet).

In the final segment, Williams wanted to address the "illusion of escape", by moving to the natural, verdant greens of the Filipino jungle, only to pull back into a machine-filled factory, which he found to be a "very strange" and "very digital place".

Reception.
"The Human Surge" premiered at the <a href="Locarno%20Film%20Festival">Locarno Film Festival</a> to generally good reviews. It won the main prize in the section "Filmmakers of the Present" at the festival, the jury of which included Italian horror director <a href="Dario%20Argento">Dario Argento</a>.

When the movie was shown at the <a href="Maryland%20Film%20Festival">Maryland Film Festival</a>, programmer Eric Allen Hatch invoked the concept of "<a href="slow%20cinema">slow cinema</a>", citing filmmakers such as <a href="Andrei%20Tarkovsky">Andrei Tarkovsky</a>, <a href="Lisandro%20Alonso">Lisandro Alonso</a>, <a href="Harmony%20Korine">Harmony Korine</a> and <a href="Gus%20van%20Sant">Gus van Sant</a>, who also take advantage of the durational aspect of the moving image. In an interview with the director for "Filmmaker Magazine", critic Vadim Rizov picked up on that theme, regarding Hungarian filmmaker <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Tarr">Béla Tarr</a> as an important influence on the film's long tracking shots following characters moving through space. He also mentioned van Sant, finding the handheld camera to be suggestive of "the physical foot leather fueling the camerawork."

Jennifer Hocking

Jennifer Hocking (1929-2011) was an Australian-born British-based fashion model in the 1950s and early 1960s, who then became fashion editor of "<a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>" and "<a href="Queen%20%28magazine%29">Queen</a>". Whilst there, she gave <a href="Anna%20Wintour">Anna Wintour</a> her first magazine job. Hocking then pursued fashion design, before rediscovering success as a mature model in the 1990s, when she was described as a "grande dame" after her appearance in <a href="Mario%20Testino">Mario Testino</a>'s shoots for <a href="Burberry">Burberry</a>.

Early life.
Hocking was born in Sydney, where she went to art school. In 1952 she borrowed the fare from her brother and sailed to the United Kingdom to pursue a career as a fashion model. Whilst there, she married a male model and actor called Nigel Howland. The marriage eventually ended in divorce.

Career.
Modelling, part 1.
Hocking began her career as a model by doing fashion shows, but eventually became a leading photographic model, basing her style on that of a leading American model, <a href="Anne%20St.%20Marie">Anne St. Marie</a>. In 1956 Hocking was named London Model of the Year by "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>". Although she could present as aloof and sophisticated, she also had an approachable quality, which enabled her modelling career to be most successful during the transitional period between the 1950s and the mid-1960s, as she resembled a young career woman rather than one of the haughty ladies favoured for 1950s fashion photography.

Along with <a href="Paulene%20Stone">Paulene Stone</a>, she became a favoured model of <a href="Terence%20Donovan%20%28photographer%29">Terence Donovan</a> and <a href="David%20Montgomery%20%28photographer%29">David Montgomery</a>. <a href="Brian%20Duffy">Brian Duffy</a> photographed her with the author <a href="Frank%20Norman">Frank Norman</a>. However, Hocking became aware that her maturity was working against her, as teenage models began to be more popular, and she ceased modelling.

Journalism.
Hocking's first job after quitting modelling was as a stylist for "Fashion", before being transferred to "<a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>" and succeeding <a href="Molly%20Parkin">Molly Parkin</a> as fashion editor. She stayed on in 1970 when Harper's Bazaar merged with "<a href="Queen%20%28magazine%29">Queen</a>" to become "Harper's & Queen".

Whilst at Harper's & Queen, Hocking was challenged by the small budgets and tiny fashion department, but hired a young 21-year old <a href="Anna%20Wintour">Anna Wintour</a> as her editorial assistant as she was impressed by Wintour's precocious professionalism. In 1974, Hocking was asked by the <a href="Fashion%20Museum%2C%20Bath">Fashion Museum, Bath</a> to choose that year's defining looks for their <a href="Dress%20of%20the%20Year">Dress of the Year</a> collection, for which she selected male and female knitted ensembles by <a href="Missoni">Missoni</a>. A couple of years later, Hocking helped style <a href="Joanna%20Lumley">Joanna Lumley</a> for some episodes of "<a href="The%20New%20Avengers%20%28TV%20series%29">The New Avengers</a>".

Following the decision of Harpers & Queen to try and challenge <a href="Vogue%20%28British%20magazine%29">British "Vogue"</a>'s place at the top of the British fashion magazine hierarchy, Hocking decided to leave, and was succeeded by <a href="Min%20Hogg">Min Hogg</a> despite Wintour trying for the job.

Fashion design.
After leaving "Harper's & Queen", Hocking became a fashion designer for Christopher Carr Jones's mail-order company, and then started up her own equivalent business.

Modelling, part 2.
In the 1990s, Hocking resumed modelling as a professional mature model, and came to the attention of <a href="Mario%20Testino">Mario Testino</a>, who had been seeking out other models that had retired in the mid-1960s in order to develop the narrative of his photographs for <a href="Burberry">Burberry</a>. Along with <a href="Tania%20Mallet">Tania Mallet</a>, Hocking became one of Testino's favourite models as a representation of the "early-60s Englishness" that enhanced the Burberry brand. In 2002, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described Hocking and Mallet as "grande dames" who looked as good in Burberry fashion as their co-star, the young and glamorous <a href="Elizabeth%20Jagger">Elizabeth Jagger</a>.

Later life and death.
Hocking died in 2011 of cancer at the age of 81. She was survived by her daughter Wendy, also a model, and her son Julian.

Swedification

Swedification refers to the spread of the <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish language</a>, <a href="Swedes">people</a> and <a href="Culture%20of%20Sweden">culture</a> or policies which introduced these changes.

Historical Swedification.
Swedification of Scania.
Following the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Roskilde">Treaty of Roskilde</a>, which was one of the treaties that successfully ended the <a href="Second%20Northern%20War">Second Northern War</a>, all areas in the historical region of <a href="Sk%C3%A5neland">Skåneland</a> was ceded by <a href="Denmark-Norway">Denmark-Norway</a> to the <a href="Swedish%20Empire">Swedish Empire</a> in early 1658. One of the most important questions for the Swedish Empire was on how to make the Scanians feel like they were Swedish, rather than a part of Denmark. On <a href="16%20April">16 April</a> 1658, representatives of <a href="Scania">Scania</a>, <a href="Blekinge">Blekinge</a> and <a href="Halland">Halland</a>'s nobility, citizens, clergy and peasants gathered for a day of fury in Malmö Town Hall. On a given sign, the ombuds fell to the knees and promised their new king's faithfulness. The oath was appointed by a secretary. <a href="Charles%20X%20Gustav%20of%20Sweden">Charles X Gustav</a> was not present himself but was represented by an empty chair surrounded by Swedish soldiers.

In 1662 a so-called farm day in Malmö was held, where the Scanians accepted new taxes and regulations that differed completely from Danish law. "Lilla tullen" ("the little custom") was such an idea. All goods brought into the cities would be charged with customs, just as in all Swedish cities. In each city council there should also be at least two Swedish-born people among the councilors. In the same way as in the rest of Sweden, the cities were divided into <a href="Staple%20right">stacks</a> and settlements. Many nationals also forced into mayor seats. At the same time, the inhabitants of Scania received representation in the <a href="Riksdag">Riksdag</a>, unlike other areas that had been conquered by the Swedish Empire.

As early as when Charles X Gustav landed in Helsingborg in 1658, he met Bishop <a href="Peder%20Winstrup">Peder Winstrup</a> from Lund on the pier. The bishop became a driving force for the establishment of <a href="University%20of%20Lund">University of Lund</a> as a Swedish counterweight to <a href="University%20of%20Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a>. In 1666 the university was established under the name "Regia Academia Carolina". The official opening ceremony took place in January 1668.

The Swedification of Scania did not begin until about two decades after the Roskilde peace. <a href="Johan%20Gyllenstierna">Johan Gyllenstierna</a> suggested that it should've been done by forced immigration to the Baltics, something that was never carried out.

J.H.C. Morris

John Humphrey Carlisle Morris (18 February 1910 - 29 September 1984) was a British legal scholar, best known for his contributions to the <a href="conflict%20of%20laws">conflict of laws</a>.

Early life.
John Morris was born in <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a> on 18 February 1910. He was educated at <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse School</a> where he was elected to a Holford Scholarship to read history at <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>, although after two terms he switched to study law. He graduated with first class honours degrees in the Final Honour School and subsequently on the . He was elected to an Eldon Law Scholarship, but was unsuccessful in his quest for the <a href="Vinerian%20Scholarship">Vinerian Scholarship</a>.

In 1934 he was called to the Bar by <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn">Gray's Inn</a>, but he did not enjoy legal practice. In 1936 he left to return to Oxford at a tutor in law at <a href="Magdalen%20College%2C%20Oxford">Magdalen College, Oxford</a> where (with the exception of one year as a visiting fellow at Harvard) he would spend the remainder of his professional life. During his brief career at <a href="Barristers%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">the Bar</a>, he did appear on one occasion before the <a href="Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> in "<a href="Government%20of%20India%20v%20Taylor">Government of India v Taylor</a>" [1955] AC 491.

In 1939 he married Mercy Jane Kinch. They never had children.

War service.
At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> Morris was too old to enlist, so instead joined the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Reserve">Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve</a>. He was posted initially to the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a> to defend against possible attack, and was later involved in allied training operations preparing for <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a>.

Academic contributions.
After arriving at Magdalen, Morris was credited with transforming the teaching of law at the college, including the recruitment of key academics such as <a href="Rupert%20Cross">Rupert Cross</a>. Two students who claimed to have been particularly influenced by him was <a href="Nicolas%20Browne-Wilkinson%2C%20Baron%20Browne-Wilkinson">Lord Browne-Wilkinson</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Dworkin">Ronald Dworkin</a>. Unusually, he never held a chair at Oxford. He was reportedly offered the post of <a href="Vinerian%20Professor%20of%20English%20Law">Vinerian Professor of English Law</a> in 1954, but declined in favour of his colleague, Rupert Cross.

He is most famous for his contributions to private international law. Whilst at Harvard he published a notable article in <a href="Harvard%20Law%20Review">Harvard Law Review</a> on the subject, and he taught the subject for decades to BCL students at Oxford. But he is most famous as general editor of what is now as "<a href="Dicey%20Morris%20%26amp%3B%20Collins">Dicey Morris & Collins on the Conflict of Laws</a>". However he also published the 9th edition of "Theobald on Wills" and "Cases on Private International Law". He also wrote extensively on property law.

Morris was a longstanding critic of the <a href="double%20actionability">double actionability</a> rule in tort, but did not live long enough to see the rule relaxed by the Privy Council in "<a href="Red%20Sea%20Insurance%20Co%20Ltd%20v%20Bouygues%20SA">Red Sea Insurance Co Ltd v Bouygues SA</a>" [1995] 1 AC 190.

Upon his retirement Morris was honoured with a book published in dedication to him: "Contemporary Problems in the Conflict of Law: Essays in Honour of John Humphrey Carlile Morris". The foreword was written by <a href="Leslie%20Scarman%2C%20Baron%20Scarman">Lord Scarman</a>, who expressed himself as indebted to Morris for his guidance during his (Scarman's) time as Chairman of the <a href="Law%20Commission%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Law Commission</a>.

Films.
"Wet Hot American Summer" (2001).
In 1981, Camp Firewood, a summer camp located near Waterville, Maine, is preparing for its last day of camp. Counselors have one last chance to have a romantic encounter with another person at Camp Firewood. The summer culminates in a talent show. Beth (<a href="Janeane%20Garofalo">Janeane Garofalo</a>), the camp director, struggles to keep her counselors in order—and her campers alive—while falling in love with Henry (<a href="David%20Hyde%20Pierce">David Hyde Pierce</a>), an astrophysics associate professor at Colby College. Henry has to devise a plan to save the camp from a piece of NASA's Skylab, which is falling to Earth.

Coop (<a href="Michael%20Showalter">Michael Showalter</a>) has a crush on Katie (<a href="Marguerite%20Moreau">Marguerite Moreau</a>), but has to pry her away from her rebellious boyfriend, Andy (<a href="Paul%20Rudd">Paul Rudd</a>). Only Gene (<a href="Christopher%20Meloni">Christopher Meloni</a>), the shell-shocked Vietnam war veteran and camp chef, can help Coop win Katie—with some help from a talking can of mixed vegetables (voiced by <a href="H.%20Jon%20Benjamin">H. Jon Benjamin</a>). Gary (<a href="A.D.%20Miles">A.D. Miles</a>) and J.J. (<a href="Zak%20Orth">Zak Orth</a>) attempt to figure out why McKinley (Michael Ian Black) hasn't been with a woman, the reason being that McKinley is in love with Ben (<a href="Bradley%20Cooper">Bradley Cooper</a>). Victor (<a href="Ken%20Marino">Ken Marino</a>) attempts to lose his virginity with the resident loose-girl Abby (<a href="Marisa%20Ryan">Marisa Ryan</a>) and Susie (<a href="Amy%20Poehler">Amy Poehler</a>) and Ben attempt to produce and choreograph the greatest talent show Camp Firewood has ever seen.

"Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp" (2015).
In 1981 at Camp Firewood it is now the first day of camp, and the camp counselors first meet. The series builds to the camp putting on a stage play called 'Electro City', while Beth and Gene take on sinister government forces and Andy and the other Counselors take on their Camp Tiger Claw rivals. The series features new arrivals; <a href="Chris%20Pine">Chris Pine</a> as Eric, a reclusive musician; <a href="Jon%20Hamm">Jon Hamm</a> as The Falcon, a hired assassin; <a href="Kristen%20Wiig">Kristen Wiig</a> as Courtney, a snobby Camp Tigerclaw counselor; <a href="Josh%20Charles">Josh Charles</a> as Blake McCarthy, a Camp Tigerclaw counselor and Katie’s boyfriend; and <a href="Lake%20Bell">Lake Bell</a> as Donna Berman, Coop’s love interest.

"Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later" (2017).
In 1991 the former camp counselors come back to Camp Firewood for a reunion. The series sees Mitch (the can of Mixed Vegetables) and Gene team up to try to stop President Ronald Reagan (<a href="Michael%20Showalter">Michael Showalter</a>) from Buying and subsequently Nuking Camp Firewood. Victor attempts to finally lose his virginity, to give Donna and Yaron (<a href="David%20Wain">David Wain</a>) a baby. Ben (now played by <a href="Adam%20Scott">Adam Scott</a>) and McKinley now have a child and to attend the reunion have to hire a nanny, Renata (<a href="Alyssa%20Milano">Alyssa Milano</a>), who may just be a knife wielding psychopath. Andy has a challenger for the 'King of Camp' hall of fame, known as Deegs (<a href="Skyler%20Gisondo">Skyler Gisondo</a>), who he must defeat.

Future.
Creators David Wain and Michael Showalter have hinted that there could be future installments in the Wet Hot American Summer series, including possibly setting the show in the Winter of 1980 or a 25-year reunion where the Actors actually play their own ages. Showalter said "...if we keep doing it at this rate, we’ll actually be our own age. Like, next time we do Wet Hot, it’ll be like, their 25th reunion, and then we’re just our actual ages or something."

Kanalon Monastery

The Kanalon Monastery (, "Iera Stavropigiaki Moni ton Kanalon") is a <a href="Greek%20Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a> <a href="convent">convent</a> on <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a>, in the north-east of the Greek region of <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>. It is a <a href="stauropegic%20monastery">stauropegic monastery</a>, subordinated directly to the <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch of Constantinople</a> (<a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>).

Location.
The convent is located at the road connecting <a href="Leptokarya">Leptokarya</a> with Karya, above the river Ziliana. The distance to Leptokarya is about 18 km, the distance (air line) to the ancient <a href="Leivithra">Leivithra</a> is about 7 km.

Name.
The name of the monastery refers to four wild brooks in the vicinity, which are called "kanalia " (κανάλια, "channels").

History.
In 1055 the monks Damianos and Joachim chose this place to build a monastery and dedicate it to the birth of the <a href="Holy%20Mother%20of%20God">Holy Mother of God</a>. The French archaeologist <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Heuzey">Léon Heuzey</a> in the other hand dated the foundation of the monastery to the ninth century. It is located at an altitude of 820 m and is surrounded by forest. There are no records of the first centuries of its existence, and an inscription from the year 1638 is the oldest surviving reference to the monastery. At that time the frescos were painted in the Chapel of All Saints. At that time, the complex consisted of the refectory and the <a href="katholikon">katholikon</a>. In 1681, a chapel dedicated to Saint Demetrios was added. The western wing, which now houses the cells of the inhabitants, was built later.

The monastery flourished in the 17th century. In the nineteenth century, it had a difficult time. It was attacked and plundered. In 1881 the katholikon collapsed for unknown reasons. A first attempt to rebuild the church according to plans by architect Stamatis failed. The church collapsed again. Two years later it was rebuilt according to the plans of the architect Efthymios Milios on the old foundations. In 1930, the last monks left the monastery. It was abandoned and began to disintegrate. It was in 2001 that the monastery was once again occupied by nuns.

Present.
The monastery is permanently inhabited by nuns. The renovation work has been largely completed and the paintings in the chapel of Saint Dimitrios are to be restored (as of July 2017).

The NRHP nomination states:Chagui'an represents the intense suffering and hardship endured by the indigenous population (Chamorros) of the U.S. Unincorporated territory of Guam during the 31 month Japanese wartime occupation of the island. Of the many incidents of Japanese military brutality on Guam, the largest known single act of violence is the beheading of 45 Chamorros by the Imperial Japanese Army at Chagui'an. The massacre site exemplifies the atrocities committed on Micronesian populations in the Pacific Theater of Operations and epitomizes the tragic extremes that can be inflicted on small, marginalized, native populations without political authority or the prerogative of military sanction in global conflicts. Chagui'an is one of only a handful of war-related massacres of civilians that occurred on U.S. soil during World War II.

J. J. Liston

John James Liston (21 September 1872 – 12 April 1944) was an Australian businessman, civic leader, and sporting administrator. He served as <a href="City%20of%20Williamstown">Mayor of Williamstown</a> and on the <a href="Melbourne%20City%20Council">Melbourne City Council</a>, and was also a long-serving president of the <a href="Victorian%20Football%20Association">Victorian Football Association</a>.

Early life and business career.
Liston was born in <a href="County%20Roscommon">County Roscommon</a>, Ireland, the son of Mary Ann (née McNamany) and John Haire Liston. The family moved to Australia in 1882, settling in <a href="Williamstown%2C%20Victoria">Williamstown, Victoria</a>. After leaving school, Liston trained as a barber and eventually started his own shop. He later became the licensee of a local hotel, and served as secretary of the Liquor Trades' Defence Union (LTDU), an organisation devoted to countering the <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance movement</a>. Victoria held referendums on prohibition in 1930 and 1938; Liston and the LTDU played a key part in their defeat.

Local government.
Liston was elected to the <a href="City%20of%20Williamstown">Williamstown City Council</a> in 1898, and became mayor for the first time in 1901 (reputedly the youngest in the state). He was re-elected to another six mayoral terms over the following three decades, serving from 1901 to 1902, 1913 to 1914, and 1922 to 1927. Liston represented the city on the <a href="Melbourne%20Harbour%20Trust">Melbourne Harbour Trust</a>, and oversaw the construction of the <a href="Williamstown%20Town%20Hall">Williamstown Town Hall</a> (opened 1927). He eventually resigned from the council in 1930, due to allegations of misconduct. In 1923, Liston had also been elected to the <a href="Melbourne%20City%20Council">Melbourne City Council</a>, where he was chairman of the traffic and building regulations committee for six years. He ran for <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Melbourne">Lord Mayor of Melbourne</a> in 1931, but lost to <a href="Harold%20Gengoult%20Smith">Harold Gengoult Smith</a> by a single vote.

Sports.
Liston was a longtime member of the <a href="Williamstown%20Football%20Club">Williamstown Football Club</a>, and was the club president from 1923 to 1933. He was also a trustee of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> and a prominent racehorse owner, serving as president of the Williamstown Racing Club from 1939 to 1944. The <a href="P%20B%20Lawrence%20Stakes">Liston Stakes</a> were named in his honour.

In 1929, Liston was elected president of the <a href="Victorian%20Football%20Association">Victorian Football Association</a> (VFA), in succession to <a href="John%20Aikman">John Aikman</a>. He was already a VFA life member at the time of his election. Liston supported amalgamation with the larger and wealthier <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Victorian Football League</a> (VFL), and when that did not eventuate controversially suggested that the VFA might merge with soccer or rugby. In 1935, he was also elected president of the <a href="Victorian%20Soccer%20Federation">Victorian Soccer Association</a>. A VFA meeting passed a resolution "congratulating him on his broad-mindedness", although the <a href="Northcote%20Football%20Club">Northcote Football Club</a>'s delegate attempted to move a censure motion.

After Liston's death in 1944, <a href="Hector%20de%20Lacy">Hector de Lacy</a> of "<a href="The%20Sporting%20Globe">The Sporting Globe</a>" wrote: "In the death of J. J. Liston football has lost a leader. He loved a thrilling sporting bout and football held the highest place in his affections. He took a leading part in the politics of the Australian game. I can vouch for his sincere desire to do the greatest good for the game itself, irrespective of pre-established ideas and constitutions. He was prepared to kick his way through any conservatism that the greater good of the game could be served." In 1945, the <a href="J.%20J.%20Liston%20Trophy">J. J. Liston Trophy</a> was established in his honour, to be awarded to the league's best player at the each of season.

Personal life.
Liston married Eva Emily Roberts in 1910, with whom he had two sons. He was widowed in 1928, but remarried in 1930 to May Ward.
