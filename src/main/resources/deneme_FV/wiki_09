The Missing Postman of Stradbally

The missing postman of Stradbally is a mystery which has remained unsolved since Larry Griffin disappeared without trace from a village in the south-east of Ireland on Christmas Day, 1929. The story went round the world at the time, while the people of the village gave ever-changing and conflicting information about what they knew of Larry's last movements to the <a href="Garda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na">Gardai</a> investigating the case.

Over the years, many of the people concerned in the matter were involved in litigation with both the Gardai and the press from which they gained substantial amounts of money. Larry's body was never found.

Extensive research has been done by Fachtna Ó Drisceoil, who obtained access to the Garda files on the case, and this has been published in his book, "The Missing Postman". He comments that Mary Grffin and her family "were the victims of the most shocking conspiracy and cover-up the young Irish state had known".

Larry Griffin.
Larry (Laurence) Griffin was born in Waterford in Ireland in 1880. He was a <a href="Bombardier%20%28rank%29">bombardier</a> in the Artillery Regiment of the British Army from 1899 until 1907, serving in India. He married Mary Fitzgerald in 1907, and the family were living with her father in 1911 – Larry was working as a farm servant.

He joined the army at the start of WW1. He was discharged on the 3rd June 1916 due to injuries received – his arm was permanently damaged and part of his ear was missing as well as some front teeth. He was awarded the British Victory and War Medal in 1918 
After being discharged from the Army, he got a job as a postman. In 1929, he and his wife and two of his three surviving children were living in <a href="Kilmacthomas">Kilmacthomas</a>, a small town in the south east of Ireland. His postal round covered the village of Stradbally which was about 8 miles away from Kilmacthomas. His daughter, Bridie, was working in England. 

The disappearance.
On <a href="Christmas">Christmas Day</a>, 1929 Larry attended Mass, delivered presents to a neighbour's children, and set off at about noon on his Post Office issue bicycle to deliver the mail in Stradbally. There was a tradition of offering both money and hospitality to the postman on Christmas Day - Larry was invited to dinner in two of the households he called on, and was given drinks in many of the others. When he had finished his deliveries, he called into the Post Office as normal. At 7pm, it started snowing. Mary waited for him to return home but he did not appear. She guessed that he might have had too much to drink and hoped that he had decided to sleep at a friend's house, rather than risk the ride home.

At 7:30am the next day, a local man walking along the road between Stradbally and Kilmacthomas came across a postman’s bicycle lying on the road three feet from the edge, pointing toward Kilmacthomas. It appeared to have been carefully laid down. There was no sign of Larry. 

The search and the investigation.
<a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Day">St. Stephen's Day</a>.
The Gardai were informed, and a search party, including Gardai from several neighouring towns, and over a hundred civilians, including postmen from Kilmacthomas, started searching. The postmen noticed that the empty mailbag, waterproof cover, overalls and a cape were carefully strapped to the carrier on the bike, and commented that that a postman would not strap his cape in this way, because it would crack when folded up. They searched the countryside between Kilmacthomas and Stradbally, particularly the marshlands on either side of the road where the bike had been found. It was initially assumed that Larry had wandered off the road and fallen into one the deep holes in the bog, but in spite of extensive searches, they did not find him. 

The disappearance was reported to Chief Superintendent Harry O'Mara from <a href="Waterford">Waterford</a> on the 27th December. He went to Stradbally and first questioned the local Gardai - Sergeant Cullinane, Gardai Dullea, Frawley, Murphy and Sullivan. Garda Frawley was married and lived in a flat above the Post Office; all the others lived at the Garda barracks. They all denied seeing Larry leave the village, and also all, particularly Garda Dullea claimed that Larry was sober. Other people in the village, however, reported that he was "a bit jolly" and "intoxicated". 

Superintendent O'Mara also established that Larry had not called in to collect the mail at places between Stradbally and the point where his bicycle had been found, even though these were part of his normal round. Another local man reported that he had been on the Stradbally to Kilmacthomas road at 4am on the 26th December and had not seen the bicycle there at that time. O'Mara now suspected foul play rather than an accidental disappearance. 

The search continued.

Father O'Shea and John Power.
On the 6th January, Father O'Shea, a priest from a neighbouring village told O'Mara that the Gardai in Stradbally were concealing what had happened, and that he should first question a sixteen-year-old boy called John Power. The next day, O'Mara interviewed John Power with Gardai from outside the area. He told them that he had been standing outside the window of Whelan's <a href="pub">pub</a> with three other men, from 6pm on Christmas Day, and they had seen Larry and Garda Dullea outside the post office at 6:30pm, who had then walked passed them and went round the corner. Garda Dullea was pushing the bicycle, Larry appeared drunk and was "trying to empty the contents of his stomach". Power also said that he remained outside Whelan's for an hour and did not see Dullea again. The other three men confirmed John Power's account.

Conflicting Garda evidence.
Garda Dullea was interviewed again, and now admitted to meeting Larry outside the post office, and to walking with him for fifty yards along the Kilmacthomas road. He again said that Larry was not drunk. When asked why he had not reported this before, he said he did not think "it was of any importance". He claimed that after leaving Larry, he returned to the centre of the village past Whelans to meet up with Cissie Whelan, daughter of the Whelans, and that they walked to Stradbally Cove, returning from there at 10pm. This was contradicted by the evidence of John Power and his friends, but Cissie Whelan backed him up.

Sergeant Cullinane first claimed that he had raided Whelans once at 6pm, but after other people gave statements saying that he had visited twice, he admitted that he had raided it again at 6:35pm. He said that the only the Whelans were present both times. 

O'Mara thought that Dullea may have been trying to cover up illegal drinking. Since 1927, pubs in Ireland were not allowed to serve alcohol on either Christmas Day or Good Friday and it would have been very damaging for a Garda to have been found to be drinking illegally.

As January progressed, more information emerged about events on Christmas Day from new witnesses and more detailed statements from previous witnesses. The story that now emerged was that shortly after 6pm, a clearly drunk Larry Griffin had called into Garda Frawley's flat, accompanied by Garda Dullea where they had drunk some more alcohol. The three of them then went outside, and the Gardai decided that Larry was too drunk to make his way home. Garda Frawley went into Whelans to see if they would put him up for the night, but realising that he had been followed in by Sergreant Cullinane, he left again. Garda Dullea then led Larry round the corner, and the two of them went in to Whelans by the back gate. Neither of them was seen to leave again. None of the Gardai had provided any of this information when they were first questioned. 

Conflicting evidence was given by the Gardai about whether or not they had been given gifts of alcohol by various publicans in the area, and also about whether or not they had been drinking. It was common practice for publicans to make gifts to the Gardai, though this could have been construed as bribery to help avoid beind raided. It was found that entries in the Garda barracks diary had been altered, and that they had not made many of the patrols which were recorded there. The Stradbally Gardai were changing their stories, contradicting each other, and eventually calling one another liars. 

O'Mara was now convinced that the Gardai were involved in the disappearance of Larry Griffin. He reported this to <a href="Eoin%20O%27Duffy">Eoin O'Duffy</a> who was the Chief Commissioner of the Garda Siochana. He also said that Gardai Dullea and Murphy "are influencing the people to make false statements and are visiting those from whom statements have been made to ascertain what they have said".
They were all transferred to Garda stations in various parts of Ireland, and a warrant was obtained to allow their mail to be intercepted as O'Mara believed that they would contact one another about the case.

Rumour, fact and surmise.
Soon everybody in Stradbally "knew" that Larry Griffin had been drinking in Whelan's pub on Christmas evening. Two of the people who had joined the search on <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Day">St. Stephen's Day</a> said that they were told by Patrick Whelan, the publican, that Larry had been in the pub the night before, that he wanted Larry to stay the night but that Larry would not do so. Patrick Whelan later told Larry's wife that Larry had not been in the pub, and that there had been no visitors in the pub on Christmas Day, something he also told the Gardai. This was contradicted by statements from two other people who said that they had been drinking in Whelans on Christmas night. They also contradicted Garda Dullea's statement that he had been with Cissie Whelan at Stradbally Cove all evening, as they said they had seen Cissie in the pub that evening. Neither of them had seen Larry there, but they had been only in the kitchen, not in the public house area. 

Father O'Shea had continued to make enquiries. He reported to the Gardai that Mrs. Cashin, the wife of Thomas Cahsin, who was the head teacher of a nearby primary school, had told him that the Gardai would never find out what had happened to Larry, and also told him that her husband had been present at whatever had happened to Larry. Thomas Cashin himself told Father O'Shea that the Gardai would never implicate him.

Jim Fitzgerald and Thomas Corbett.
On the 23rd January, two local men were interviewed at the Garda station. The circumstances under which they were taken in for questioning were later the subject of much controversy. 

Jim Fitzgerald was a 55 year old labourer who lived about a quarter of a mile from Stradbally. Thomas Corbett was 25, also a labourer. Jim Fitzgerald had taken Thomas and his girlfriend into his house when she became pregnant. 

Jim Fitzgerald said that on Christmas Day, he had gone into Whelans by the back gate with Tommy Corbett and two other people at 6:30pm. They went into the kitchen and were served drinks by Cissie Whelan. They heard singing in the bar, and Jim went outside into the yard, looked through the window into the bar, and saw Gardai Dullea and Murphy, as well as Cissie Whelan and several other people in there. He also said that when he was standing in the hall, he saw a man coming out of the bar towards the lavatory who had a postman's cap on, and he was fairly sure that it was Larry Griffin. He also said that he was in the bar himself. His statement continues:

Jim Fitzgerald said that Whelan then told Morrissey that he had hum ruined, but Morrissey said that they would take Larry away and no-one would know about it. He said that the two Gardai, Thomas Cashin, all the Whelan family, and four other people, Ned Dunphy, Jack Galvin, George and Patrick Cummins came into the bar. He said that Cashin, Morrissey, George Cummins and Patrick Whelan put the body in Cashin's car (Cashin owned the only car in the village) and drove away, and that Garda Dullea took away Larry's bicycle saying he would leave it on the Five Cross road somewhere, and that Garda Murphy accompanied him. He did not know where they put the body but thought that they planned to drop it down a mine shaft. 

Tommy Corbett agreed that he and Jim Fitzgerald had gone to the back of Whelans on Christmas Day, but told a completely different story about what had happened after that. He said that they had not been admitted to Whelans, and that he had gone to O'Reilly's, another pub in the village and after that to "The Hall" (this was a room in the house of the McGraths which was a sort of low-cost card playing club). He said that a fight took place between himself and another local man. None of the other witnesses supported Jim Fitzgerald's statement, Parts of Tommy Corbett's story were supported by some witnesses, while contradiced by others. All were, however, in agreement about the fight that took place in "The Hall". Many of the witnesses were, however, changing their stories as time went on. 
Superintendent O'Mara reported that Jim Fitzgerald had asked to remain with the Gardai as he was afraid to go home. He was taken into protective custody in Waterford "in the interest's of the man's safety and to prevent him being influenced by suspected persons". 

Searches for the body.
Copper mining had been a major industry in the area between 1827 and 1877, and there were many abandoned mineshafts in the area. Several of the old mineshafts were explored. Platforms were erected, grappling hooks and dredging appparatus used. The possibility of sending down a diver was explored but it was decided that this would be too dangerous. Sightseers poured in to watch, as well as members of the press. The bodies of several pigs, goats and dogs were found., .

The foreshore at Stradbally cove was dug to a depth of four feet. Local farmers and labourers undertook another search of the marshland. The garden of George Cummins, who had been reported by Jim Fitzgerald as having been involved in the disappearnce, was searched as were the grounds of a local convent, and a pond in the grounds of a local estate, all based on information given. All the recent graves in a local graveyard were opened up. 

No trace of Larry Griffin was found.

Searches for forensic evidence.
The stove In Whelans against which Larry Griffin had allegedly hit his head was removed by the Gardai, as well as a wooden bench, ladies stockings and a coal scuttle which appeared to be bloodstained. Other items were also taken away from the houses of Thomas Cashin, Ned Morrissey and George Cummins, and Thomas Cashin's car. 

Questioning and interrogations.
By the end of January, all the Stradbally Gardai had been moved to Dublin and suspended from duty on half-pay. There is evidence that they were assaulted whle being questioned.

Mrs. Frawley gave a statement in which she said that Garda Dullea had asked her on the 7th January not to mention that Larry and himself had been at Frawley's on Christmas Day.

Garda Sullivan made a statement on the 1st February admitting that he and Garda Frawley had been drinking in Whelans, O'Reilly's and Frawleys' flat on Christmas Day and that he had gone to bed at about 4pm to sleep off the effects of alcohol. He woke at 12:30am to hear Gardai Dullea and Murphy return. 

Thomas Cashin was never interviewed, but his wife gave police a statement which established a solid alibi for him for the whole Of Christmas Day 

Various people who admitted to being in Whelans on Christmas evening denied seeing Larry Griffin there. Many others were questioned but no more concrete evidence was obtained about what had happened to Larry.

Arrests and court proceedings.
Arrests.
On the morning of the 24th January, the Gardai arrested Thomas Cashin and Ned Morrissey. They were charged with the murder of Larry Griffin, disposing of a body with intent to obstruct a coroner's inquest, and of taking away a postbag and postman's cap, property of the postmaster general.

On the 26th January, Patrick Whelan, George Cummins and Patrick Cunningham were arrested and charged. Next to be arrested were Bridget Whelan and her daughter and son, Nora and James. 

All eight were held in Waterford and were remanded in custody on the 31st January.

On the 3rd February, Gardai Dullea and Murphy were arrested and charged.

Court proceedings.
On the 7th February, a preliminary hearing was held at Waterford courthouse, where the prosecution had to show that there was sufficient evidence to justify trying the defendants before a jury. 

Jim Fitzgerald was called to give evidence, but now told a very different story to what he had said in his statement of the 23rd January. He said that he, Tommy Corbett and two other men were outside Whelans and had drink handed out to them there, that he then went on to O' Reillys, and after that to "The Hall" to play cards. He went back and stood outside Whelans for a while and then went home. When the prosecuting barrister challenged him about the difference between his statement and what he was saying now, he said that he "may have told some lies in it". When questioned further he said he could not say which part was true and which was lies. The judge also questioned him but got no further. The prosecuting cousel asked for a week's remand which was granted by the judge. 

On the 14th February, the prisoners were again brought to court. Two of the men from Kilmacthomas, who came to Stradbally on St. Stephen's Day to search for Larry, told the court that Patrick Whelan had told them that Larry had been in the pub on Christmas night, that he had been very drunk, and that Whelan had tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to stay the night. 

A pathologist gave evidence about the items taken from various places, but the only ones which he could be certain that had human blood on them were sanitary items belonging to the youg women in the Whelan household. The judge gave the prosecution another week to make its case, and the defendants were again remanded in custody. 

Another hearing was held on the 21st February. Mrs. Frawley gave evidence asaying that Garda Dullea and a drunken Larry Griffin had been in her house on Christmas Day, and also that Garda Dullea had asked her not to say that she had seen him with Larry on that day. Another witness said that he had seen Garda Dullea and Larry walk round the corner at Whelans. There was evidence from Gardai about what taking statements. A further remand of one week was granted. 

At the hearing on 1 March, no new evidence was produced, but the prosecution insisted that they were close to finding Larry's body. The defendants were remanded in custody for another week. 

Om March 7, the prosecuting counsel said that further enquiries were to be made, but that he was now asking for the charges to be withdrawn. The defendants were released. There was an outburst of cheering from their friends and supporters. 

That was the last time anyone appeared in court charged with criminal offences with respect to the disappearance of Larry Griffin.

Litigation.
Tommy Corbett.
In February 1930, lawyers acting on Tommy Corbett's behalf issued summonses to four of the officers who questioned him on February th 1929, claiming damages for false imprisonment, assault and threats of murder. The case was heard in December 1930; it was alleged that the Gardai had tried to bribe him to say that he was in Whelan's pub on Christmas night, and that when he would not do so, they threatened to kill him. It was said that they then drove him to the cliffs, and threatened to throw him into the sea, and that one of the Gardai put a revolver in his mouth and threatened to shoot him. The defendants denied the allegations, but the jury believed his story, and awarded him £500 damages, and £500 costs. 

Following the case, the Gardai involved were offered a choice between resignation and dismissal; all chose the first. It would have been very difficult for them to raise the £1000 awarded against them even if they were still employed (their annual salaries ranged from £200 to £300), but it was now impossible. They tried to negotiate directly with Corbett rather than going through his solicitor. The latter objected strongly to this as it might have meant he did not get his legal costs. 

The Garda files show that they were keeping a close eye on these developments, that Thomas Cashin, Patrick Whelan and other ex-defendants were also involved, and that "there was great uneasiness amongst the Whelan and Cashin crowd" as a result of contacts between Tommy Corbett and the ex-Gardai. They seemed to be concerned that Tommy would make a deal which would involve him revealing what he knew about what had happened to Larry Griffin to the ex-Gardai. 

Thomas Cashin was seen to call Tommy Corbett into his house when Tommy was returning from a meeting with the ex-Gardai at Tramore and going straight to Whelans afterwards. Tommy was unemployed at this time, but shortly afterwards, got a job with the brother of Patrick Cunningham who was one of the ten people who had been charged. A local man told one of the current Stradbally Gardai that he believed that Whelan, Cashin and company wanted "to close his (Tommy's) mouth" because they thought he was "capable of anything". 

On 20 September 1931, Tommy Corbett announced that he had settled with the ex-Gardia, and would receive the money two days later. The Gardai notes say:

Tommy's solicitor intervened, saying Tommy Corbett would have to pay the legal costs himself if the ex-Gardai did not do so. The next day, the solicitor bought out Corbett's damages claim for £125 on condition that he had nothing more to do with the ex-Gardai. There were celebrations in Stradbally that evening. Thomas Cashin took Tommy and his wife to Whelans and drove them home later. The Cunninghams and others ex-defendants visited the Corbetts that night with whiskey and stout. 

The Whelans.
In July 1930, the Whelans were awarded £1740 in damages from Waterford News Ltd. because their newpsaper, the Evening News, had published a report on the 6th February 1929 about Larry's Griffin's disappearance which they claimed clearly implicated them in the matter.

They later received damages from the Cork Examiner for a similar article.

Gardai Murphy and Sullivan.
In 1954, they sued a British newspaper, Empire News for libel for a sum of £600 each, relating to an article which said that "the postman was taken to the police barracks for safety... During the night, he left the room. There was no banister to the stairs. He stepped out into space and crashed to his death". The case was settled and the plaintiffs received undisclosed damages. 

Thomas Cashin, James Whelan, Nora Opren (nee Whelan) and George Cummins.
In 1974, they took libel actions against <a href="the%20Waterford%20News%20and%20Star">the Waterford News and Star</a>, relating to a review of a play which was based very closely on the Stradally missing postman case. They claimed that they had been held up to hatred, ridicule and contempt because of the article. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum and the paper apologised to the plaintiffs. 

James Whelan and Nora Opren.
In the 1960s, Superindent O' Mara sent a statement to the <a href="Irish%20Times">Irish Times</a> with his account of the missing postman case, hoping that it would be published, but fear of legal action prevented this. In 1977, an Irish Times correspondent came across the statement, and wrote a long feature based on it. The Irish Times then received a letter from a solicitor acting on behalf of James Whelan and Nora Opren, saying that they intended to sue the paper for libel. The matter was settled out of court, the Irish Times having been advised that the plaintiffs were likely to be awarded substantial damages by a court. 

What happened to the people involved.
The Griffin family.
Mary Griffin's distress at the loss of her husband was compounded by the failure to find out what had happened to him, and to be unable to bury him. In addition, the household lost its income, though a fund was set up which raised over £200 for the family. There was a huge response to the appeal, especially from post office staff all over Ireland, but very few contributions from Stradbally itself. Her son, Jack set up a garage in Kilmacthomas in 1932, her daughter Bridie married and returned to Ireland to live in Mayo. Tragically, her daughter Alice died of pneumonia in 1933. Mary died in 1958, and is buried in the family plot. Larry is commemorated on the headstone. The surviving family members still hope that Larry's body will be found so that he can finally be buried with his wife. 

Jim Fitzgerald.
Jim Fitzgerald returned to Stradbally in a Garda car after his appearance in court on the 7th February.

Superintendent Hunt, another Garda who had been brought into the investigation, reported that he had interviewed Jim after the collapse of the prosecution case, and said that Jim was terrified, that he had been threatened repeatedly and could not obtain any work. Hunt organised for him to be employed by a farmer in <a href="Galway">Galway</a>. Jim left Stradbally in March 1930. Hunt interviewed Jim Fitzgerald again in Galway. He now said that he had been in Whelans between 7:30 and 8pm on Christmas night. He said that he saw Garda Dullea and Larry Griffin there at about 8pm. He left Whelans shortly afterward, met up with Tommy Corbett, and Patrick Cunningham who was one of the people charged with the murder of Larry Griffin. They moved on to O'Reilly's pub, and after that to "The Hall" where the row between Tommy Corbett and another man happened. After that he went home with Tommy Corbett, while Patrick Cunningham went off in a different direction. Jim Fitzgerald now told Hunt that he had got the story about Larry's death from Tommy Corbett who had heard it from Patrick Cunningham, his employer. Cunningham had gone on to Whelans on Christmas night and witnessed the events there. 

A home for the elderly poor in Waterford has records showing that Jim Fitzgerald entered the home in 1945. It gives details of his parents, his place of birth and death and his pension book number. In the Observation section, it says "no friends". He died there in 1961. 

Tommy Corbett.
He and his family remained in the cottage where JIm Fitzgerald had taken them in. Tommy spent some time working in England. He bought the cottage in 1965, and died in 1968. 

The Whelans.
At the time of Larry's disappearance, the Whelans were in rent arrears with their landlord, and had been successfully sued by one of their suppliers for non-payment for goods supplied. . They were able to keep the business afloat with the money they made from the various libel actions that they won and also with a loan from Thomas Cashin. 

Patrick died in 1946, and his wife Bridget in 1961. His son, James inherited the pub, and when he died in 1997, his son took it over and still runs it. Nora died in 1987, and Cissie in 2004. 

Thomas Cashin.
Thomas Cashin had been the head teacher at Ballylaneen national school for some years. His wife also taught there even though she did not have a teaching qualification. His record at the school was less than glowing. Inspectors' reports on his work for the previous four years had rated him as non-efficient. He did not have an Irish language qualification and had failed the examination in 1924, 1925 and 1926 and 1928, and didn't turn up for the examination in 1927 and 1929. In May 1928, he was warned that serious action would be taken if matters did not improve. 

An inspector who turned up at the school on the 28th July 1928 found the pupils sitting on the roadside with their books and their lunches. Cashin apppeared at 11:55, claiming that he was working to old time, and that the pupils were only there to help tidy up the school. The inspector did not believe him. 

When he was charged with murder, he was suspended without pay. For reasons which have never been explained, he was not interviewed by the Gardai at any time. When the case was dropped, the Department of Education wrote to him asking him to respond to allegations that he been in a pub on Christmas Day, that he had been involved in the killing of Larry Griffin, and that his car had been used to dispose of the body. He vehemently denied all the allegations, expressing outrage that he should be accused of such offences. The Department of Education also sought information from the Gardai who responded saying that they were convinced of his guilt, but the Department eventually accepted that there was no chance of this being proved in court, so they had to re-instate him - this happened in December 1930. Cashin then demanded that he be paid for the time when he had been suspended and this was approved by the government in 1932. 

After his re-instatement, he continued to get poor reports, being rated as "non-efficient" from 1931 until 1940 when he got an "efficient" rating for the first time. There is no documentation for subsequent years. He and his wife retired in 1957 when the school closed down. He played a prominent role in the community and was active in the local <a href="Fianna%20Fail">Fianna Fail</a> branch. 

He died in 1976. 

Recent developments.
In 1986, Breandan Ó' hEither, a journalist and broadcaster, passed through Stradbally. He was recognised by a man in the street, and when passing Whelan's, said to the man - "Was it upstairs or downstairs it happened?". The response was "I think it might be a good idea if you fuck off out of here". 

In the early 1990s, the broadcaster, Cathal ÓShannon tried to make a TV programme about the case, but <a href="Raidi%C3%B3%20Teilif%C3%ADs%20%C3%89ireann">RTE</a> turned it down because James Whelan was still alive, and likely to sue for libel. He also reported that "I was almost run out of Stradbally and received two threats of legal action from the Whelan family" while he was researching the case. 

Tadgh Ó Dúshlaine, who has written an unpublished account of the case, requested access to Garda files many times without success. 
In February 2009, the Irish Language programme section of RTE started CSÍ, a new series about historical crime cases. Fachtna Ó Drisceoil was engaged to work on it. He discussed the case with Tadgh Ó Dúshlaine and was able to access some of the witness statements in the National Archives, in particular, Jim Fitzgerald's statement. He also spoke to surviving relatives of Larry Griffin and the son of Mike Murphy who had taken over Larry's job as postman of Stradbally. The programme was broadcast on the 14th September 2009. A few days before the broadcast, the Garda Commissioner announced that all the files on the case would be made available. It took Facthna some time to extract all the available information. There were 5000-10000 pages in the file, but no physical evidence which might have provided DNA evidence which might show what had happened to Larry. Additional information from these files was incorporated in the book published in 2011.

Several newspaper articles appeared after the programme was broadcast.

Fachtna concludes that the Gardai at the time failed to cross-check Jim Fitzgerald's statement with other witness statements which would have strongly indicated that he was not in Whelans when he said he was. Fachtna believes that the statement taken by Superintendent Hunt from Jim Fitzgerald after he moved to Galway is more accurate than the first one, and that Jim did indeed get an account of what happened from Tommy Corbett who had heard it from Patrick Cunningham - he was in Whelans when the incident occurred and was one of the people accused and charged.

Fachtna believes that there was an altercation in Whelans involving Larry Griffin and others in which he was either killed outright, or that he was injured, taken across the road to the Garda barracks, where he later stumbled out of bed and fell down the stairs to his death. The people involved decided to cover up his death to protect their jobs and positions of power. Patrick Whelan was already in financial difficulty and losing his licence would have been a disaster. Cashin and the two Gardai, Dullea and Murphy would have lost their jobs if it was found that they had been drinking illegally.

Over the years, a variety of locations have been suggested for where Larry's body was hidden, but it remains undiscovered. It is possible that very few people actually knew the exact location. Larry's family still hope that his body will ultimately rest in the family plot with his wife, Mary.

Abyssinian Conquest

The Abyssinian Conquest, also known as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, was a <a href="colonial%20war">colonial war</a> that started in the fall of 1935, after <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Mussolini</a> sent 230,000 Italian and African troops, armed with 6,000 machine guns, 700 field pieces, 150 tanks, and 150 aircraft, into <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> to avenge the defeat of <a href="Battle%20of%20Adwa">Adowa</a> in 1896 and to expand the <a href="Italian%20imperialism%20under%20Fascism">Fascist empire</a>. The war resulted in the conquest of Ethiopia.

Italian advance.
The Ethiopian-Italian Somaliland border had been tense since a clash at Walwal in the Ogaden region on December 5, 1934, had resulted in the deaths of 107 Ethiopians. On October 3, Italian forces, led by General Emilio De Bono and totaling 179,161 troops, 580 guns, 112 tanks, and 130 aircraft, struck from Eritrea in the northeast, while other columns, totaling 50,000 troops, 117 guns, 45 tanks, and 38 aircraft under the flag of General Rodolfo Graziani, invaded Italian Somaliland in the southeast.

Ethiopian forces.
Ethiopian forces numbered 350,000 (but only one-quarter of them had received any military training), 200 old artillery pieces, 50 anti-aircraft guns, and a few armored cars.

Reinforcement.
The Italian advance from Eritrea was soon slowed, and the forces of Ras Imru and Ras Kassa even attempted a counteroffensive in Tigre Province, December 15, 1935 – January 20, 1936. Anxious to get on with his armed reconstruction of the Roman Empire, Mussolini dispatched reinforcements and a new commander, Marshal Pietro Badoglio. By January 1936 half a million Italian soldiers were deployed on the two fronts.

Renewed Italian advance.
On January 20, Badoglio, with 7 Italian and 2 Eritrean divisions, resumed the offensive in the north, narrowly winning a close-fought battle in the Temben Mountains by January 24 that killed or wounded 605 Italians and 417 Eritrean askaris. The forces of Ras Kassa had lost 5,000 killed, wounded or missing, of 100,000 engaged from December 15–January 20, and another 1,000 killed, 2,000 wounded during the Italian offensive of January 20–24.

In the south, Graziani fended off attacks by Ras Desta's army, January 6–23, 1936, inflicting 3,000 casualties on the Ethiopians. Next, the 80,000-man army of Ras Mulugueta was shattered by 4 Italian regular divisions and 2 Blackshirt divisions at the Battle of Enderta (Amba Aradam), February 10–19. Mluguta and 6,000 Ethiopians were killed and twice that number wounded, with many of the casualties coming from massed Italian artillery of 280 guns and air attacks from 170 planes. Italian losses totaled 800. From February 27–29, 180,000 Italians and askaris encircled and destroyed the 60,000 men of Ras Seyum in the Second Battle of Tembien. About 8,000 Ethiopians were killed. Italian and Eritrean casualties totaled 600.

To the west, the last of the Ethiopian armies in the northern province of Tigre, the 25,000-man force of Ras Imru, was attacked by 47,000 Italians on February 29. By March 3 the Ethiopians were defeated, with a loss of 4,000 men, but the Italians had lost 1,000 killed, wounded or missing (only 12 of them askaris) in dislodging the enemy from strong positions on the heights of Shire.

On March 3–4, as many as 10,000 of the retreating Ethiopians were killed, wounded or reported missing, after Italian bombers dropped 80 tons of high explosive bombs, incendiaries, and mustard gas on Ras Imru's army as it attempted to cross the Takazze fords.

Italian advance to Addis Ababa.
Now only Emperor Haile Selassie's personal army of 31,000 stood between the Italians and the Ethiopian capital at Addis Ababa. On March 31, this army with support from two smaller columns, struck the Italian forward positions around Mai Ceu, manned by 40,000 Italians and Eritreans. The Ethiopian attacks were beaten back after 8,000 had fallen. The invaders lost 400 Italian soldiers and 873 Eritrean askaris killed, wounded or missing. The retreating army of the emperor was caught and massacred by 73 tons of bombs and a cloud of mustard gas dropped by fascist bombers at Lake Ashangi on April 4. There was now no organized force left to oppose the Italian advance to Addis Ababa.

On May 5 the Italians entered the city. In the south, Graziani's progress had been slow until April 15, 1936. On that day, he smashed 38,000 Italians, Somalis, and Libyans against a fortified line manned by 28,000 Ethiopians under the command of Ras Nasibu. In the ensuing ten-day Battle of the Ogaden, the Ethiopians were beaten, with a loss of 5,000 killed, wounded or missing. Italian casualties topped 2,000. Ethiopia was conquered.

Guerrilla resistance.
Abba Petros led attacks on the 10,000-man Italian garrison of Addis Ababa, July 28–30, 1936. The attacks were repulsed and Abba Petros was killed. In November the Italians launched sweeps to wipe out the resistance forces in the south. On February 19, 1937, Graziani was wounded in a grenade attack at a public reception in the capital. Blackshirt retaliation in Addis Ababa resulted in at least 3,000 deaths, and executions around the country claimed 1,469 more victims by March 28. In May, 426 monks and 23 laymen of the Debra Libanos monastery were executed for subversion at the orders of Graziani. This sparked further rebellion, which led in turn to major Italian sweeps by more than 60,000 troops in March and April 1938.

Some 75,000 resistance fighters died during the occupation, 35,000 Ethiopians died in concentration camps, and 17,800 civilians were killed in Italian air raids. In 1941, British and Ethiopian forces liberated the ancient land, killing 5,000 Italians and 15,000 askaris in the campaign.

Origins.
Helena was conceived in late 2015 by Henry Elkus and Zachary Bohn as a way to encourage dialogue and collaboration between leaders of different generations. Bohn exited the project shortly after its inception, whereafter Elkus continued to build the group alongside fellow <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> <a href="sophomore">sophomore</a> Samuel Feinburg, who became Helena’s Executive Director and COO.

While a first-year student at Yale, Elkus became “fascinated” with the structures of <a href="governments">governments</a>, <a href="non-governmental%20organizations">non-governmental organizations</a>, and <a href="think-tanks">think-tanks</a>. He began developing Helena as an attempt to restructure the basic model of a <a href="think-tank">think-tank</a>, gearing it toward the production of “actionable” initiatives, rather than the production of <a href="research">studies</a>. He argued that these actions would be best taken on by leaders with the capacity to implement them, rather than by in-house researchers. <a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a> described the concept as a plan to “to build a society of world leaders across generations and fields of expertise that could lead to the creation and implementation of breakthrough ideas.”

During Helena’s early development, Elkus “travelled to various <a href="Summit%20%28meeting%29">summits</a> and <a href="Convention%20%28meeting%29">conferences</a>.” He was surprised to find that attendees shared a narrow range of <a href="Occupation">occupational backgrounds</a>, and few were young. Elkus felt that this was out of step with global trends, arguing that advances in technology and digital connectivity have “allowed young people to gain unprecedented influence in our society”, and that the “complex <a href="Global%20issue">global issues</a>” of the 21st century would be better addressed by intellectually diverse groups. As a consequence, Elkus mandated that each of Helena’s core members represent a different field - and that half be 25 years of age or younger when selected to join the group. This focus on youth and <a href="Interdisciplinarity">interdisciplinary</a> thinking has become a hallmark of Helena’s structure and philosophy.

After Helena’s development began to accelerate during Elkus and Feinburg’s second year of university, the pair chose not to return to <a href="Yale">Yale</a>. They moved to <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a>, where Helena is now headquartered.

Organizational Structure.
Helena’s <a href="organizational%20structure">organizational structure</a> is centered around its annual “groups” of 30 members. Named each year, these member groups are composed of prominent leaders from multiple <a href="Generation">generations</a> and fields. At the time of their selection, half of the 30 members are 25 years old or younger, and half are over the age of 25. Each member is chosen to represent a separate field. Helena’s first member group has been referred to as “one of the world’s most powerful networks.”

Helena has been described as an “<a href="unorthodox">unorthodox</a>” and “disruptive” think-tank by <a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>, <a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>, and others, due to the fact that the organization places a heavy emphasis on producing initiatives rather than written research. Helena Member Tim Doner has described Helena as a “factory for integrating and producing ideas.” In an interview, Samuel Feinburg argued that: “what we’re working towards at Helena is not only to bring these stakeholders together, but to direct them toward devising and enacting real projects and policies - to convene and to act. In that sense, we are both a ‘think’ and a ‘do’ tank.”

Helena is a 501(c)(3) <a href="non-profit">non-profit</a>, <a href="non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental organization</a>. The organization is non-doctrinal, and does not hold core <a href="political">political</a>, <a href="economic">economic</a>, or <a href="religious">religious</a> stances. Helena is funded primarily via private donations from individual <a href="philanthropists">philanthropists</a> and their <a href="Foundation%20%28nonprofit%29">foundations</a>.

Membership.
Each year, Helena announces a permanent ‘group’ of 30 members. Helena's members are prominent experts from a wide range of different fields. They serve as the "driving force" behind the group's activities and engage in regular meetings. Helena membership does not expire or terminate. Becoming a member of Helena is “merit-based, doesn’t cost money, and doesn’t require subscription to any political, religious or economic beliefs.”

At the time of their selection, half of Helena’s 30 members are 25 years of age or younger. The other half are over 25 years old. This structure derives from Helena’s belief that “better solutions … result from the inclusion of multiple <a href="Generation">generations</a>,” because “leaders under 25” have attained great success and influence in the <a href="Digital%20transformation">digital era</a>, and because approximately half the <a href="World%20population">world’s population</a> is under the age of 25. 

At present, Helena’s members represent the fields of: <a href="professional%20athletics">professional athletics</a>, <a href="education">education</a>, <a href="music">music</a>, <a href="marketing">marketing</a>, <a href="Supply%20chain">supply chain economics</a>, <a href="Film%20industry">cinema</a>, <a href="entertainment">entertainment</a>, <a href="Human%20rights">human rights activism</a>, <a href="spirituality">spirituality</a>, <a href="biomedicine">biomedicine</a>, <a href="Magic%20%28illusion%29">magic</a>, <a href="cryptography">cryptography</a>, <a href="space%20exploration">space exploration</a>, <a href="conglomerate%20%28company%29">conglomerate corporations</a>, <a href="conservation">conservation</a>, <a href="bioscience">bioscience</a>, <a href="econometrics">quantitative economics</a>, <a href="private%20equity">private equity</a>, <a href="governance">governance</a>, <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="Health%20care">healthcare</a>, <a href="arctic%20exploration">arctic exploration</a>, <a href="international%20relations">international relations</a>, <a href="Military%20intelligence">military intelligence</a>, <a href="humanitarian%20aid">humanitarian aid</a>, <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>, <a href="Plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma physics</a>, <a href="big%20data">big data</a>, <a href="Algorithm">algorithmic</a> <a href="political%20risk">political risk</a>, <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a>, <a href="marine%20biology">marine biology</a>, <a href="oceanography">oceanography</a>, and <a href="venture%20capital">venture capital</a>.


Brain Trust.
Helena’s ‘Brain Trust’ is separate from its regular membership. The Brain Trust is also a body “of accomplished experts across varying fields” but is not limited in size or organized by age quotas. In the fashion of Helena’s core members, the Brain Trust meets regularly and contributes to Helena’s projects. Compared to Helena’s core member groups, its Brain Trust members are typically experts in more specific, focused <a href="Expertise">domains</a>. The purpose of the Brain Trust is to provide Helena with access to a broader set of expertise and knowledge, and a larger overall scale.

Helena’s Brain Trust currently lists over 40 members, including <a href="international%20relations">international relations</a> expert <a href="Parag%20Khanna">Parag Khanna</a>, former <a href="List%20of%20Speakers%20of%20the%20California%20State%20Assembly">Speaker</a> of the <a href="California%20State%20House%20of%20Representatives">California State House of Representatives</a> <a href="Robert%20Hertzberg">Robert Hertzberg</a>, artist <a href="Janet%20Echelman">Janet Echelman</a>, <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a> and explorer <a href="Wade%20Davis%20%28anthropologist%29">Wade Davis</a>, historian <a href="Karen%20Greenberg">Karen Greenberg</a>, <a href="poet">poet</a> <a href="Reginald%20Dwayne%20Betts">Reginald Dwayne Betts</a>, and <a href="international%20human%20rights%20law">human rights lawyer</a> <a href="Karen%20I.%20Tse">Karen I. Tse</a>.

Activities.
Helena works to create and execute “actionable initiatives” that “address meaningful problems.” It discusses these problems in ‘Helena Meetings’, and launches initiatives resulting from those meetings that are known as ‘Helena Projects’. <a href="TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a> described the scope of Helena’s activities as “discuss(ing) <a href="global%20issues">global problems</a> and creat(ing) and fund(ing) solutions to those problems.”

Helena Meetings.
The primary form of interaction between Helena’s members is known as the “Helena Meeting.” The meetings are “highly frequent, private discussions between small groups of (Helena’s) members,” and take place internationally. Members meet in small groups, both digitally and in-person. Most larger gatherings occur at Helena’s Los Angeles headquarters. Media outlets have described Helena’s member meetings as the organization’s “calling card.”

Helena meetings are the organization's mechanism to both conceive and operate Helena’s projects. During the meetings, members discuss the ideas and trends shaping their respective fields and global society. While some meetings consist only of intellectual debate and discussion, others are operational meetings focused on the execution of Helena Projects.

In interviews with the media, Helena members have described the meetings as a mechanism to develop potential solutions to existing <a href="global%20issues">global dilemma</a>, to develop innovations and new projects that are not based on addressing existing problems, and to foster cooperation between leaders that may have otherwise never worked together due to generational or political differences.

Helena Projects.
Helena describes its projects as “actionable initiatives designed to address significant <a href="global%20issues">global problems</a>.” These projects are conceived and operated by Helena’s members and staff. Some of Helena’s initiatives are private, and others are publicised. To date, Helena has launched several public initiatives, most notably a <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> prize and a <a href="security%20council">security council</a>.

The Helena Prize.
Announced in October of 2016, The Helena Prize was Helena’s first public initiative.

Described as a search for “a business plan to fight climate change”, the Prize sought to spur and support innovation by identifying and rewarding a <a href="business">for-profit</a> venture with a “plausible and definable net-negative impact on <a href="radiative%20forcing">radiative forcing</a>. According to Helena <a href="CEO">CEO</a> Henry Elkus, the Prize aimed “to throw the book at the winner from as many angles as possible to increase their chance of success.”

The Prize was backed by <a href="The%20Boston%20Consulting%20Group">The Boston Consulting Group</a> and <a href="Sierra%20Energy">Sierra Energy</a>. Helena assembled an <a href="Advisory%20board">advisory board</a> of climate scientists, <a href="Clean%20technology">clean-tech</a> venture capitalists and other industry experts to select, then directly support the winner.

The Helena Prize was open to applications from October 2016 through January 2017. From February to April 2017, applicants were vetted by <a href="The%20Boston%20Consulting%20Group">The Boston Consulting Group</a> and the Prize’s Advisory Board. In early May 2017, the Helena Prize was awarded to Christoph Gerald and Jan Würzbacher of Climeworks, a <a href="Carbon%20capture%20and%20storage">carbon-capture</a> technology company based in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich%2C%20Switzerland">Zürich, Switzerland</a>.

Climeworks’ reward included membership in Helena; mentorship from the Helena Prize’s Advisory Board, and in-kind services from an array of partners, including support from <a href="The%20Boston%20Consulting%20Group">The Boston Consulting Group</a> and the American Renewable Energy Institute.

Helena itself continues to assist Climeworks with marketing, sales and operations.

Since winning The Helena Prize, Climeworks opened the world’s first commercial plant to capture <a href="CO2">CO2</a> from the air. The company drew broad press acclaim, and was featured in over 100 news outlets, including <a href="Fast%20Company%20%28magazine%29">Fast Company</a>, <a href="Vice">Vice</a>, <a href="Upworthy">Upworthy</a>, the <a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>, and <a href="Science%20Magazine">Science Magazine</a>. Located in <a href="Hinwil%2C%20Switzerland">Hinwil, Switzerland</a>, the plant removes several hundred tons of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> from the <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20Earth">ambient air</a> annually. The CO2 is then pumped into a local <a href="greenhouse">greenhouse</a>, where it is used in place of non-renewable <a href="CO2">CO2</a> produced from <a href="fossil%20fuels">fossil fuels</a>.

The Helena Security Council.
The Helena Security Council was launched in early 2017 as “permanent program within Helena” focused on “the <a href="international%20security">global security</a> trends of the 21st century.” According to Helena’s website, the council convenes Helena members and outside experts to produce, publish, and implement insights that inform global security decisionmaking. The council currently focuses on the role of artificial intelligence in <a href="nuclear%20security">nuclear security</a>, <a href="additive%20manufacturing">additive manufacturing</a>, the increasing speed of <a href="information%20system">information systems</a>, the <a href="social%20media">decentralized media</a>, <a href="electrical%20grid">grid</a> security, and “millennial perceptions on global security.”

In an interview regarding the Council’s discussions on the intersection of artificial intelligence and <a href="nuclear%20security">nuclear security</a>, <a href="deep%20learning">deep-learning artificial intelligence</a> expert and Helena member Nikhil Buduma described “an effort to design a new framework around how we think about rogue actors, <a href="Second%20strike">second strike systems</a>, and highly automated <a href="Search%20and%20destroy">search and destroy operations</a>.”

In August 2017, Helena announced that the Security Council had partnered with the <a href="RAND%20Corporation">RAND Corporation</a>. According to Andrew Parasiliti, Director RAND's Center for <a href="Global%20Risk%20Management">Global Risk</a> and Security, the council works with RAND on “a major RAND initiative called ‘Security 2040.” In an interview with French <a href="businessman">businessman</a> and <a href="philanthropist">philanthropist</a> <a href="Alexandre%20Mars">Alexandre Mars</a>, Helena CEO Henry Elkus stated that Council’s work with <a href="RAND">RAND</a> will also result in “comprehensive global security research due to be published in 2018.”

Partnerships.
Helena has established partnerships with a number of outside organizations. The stated purpose of the partnerships is to “expand Helena’s operational capabilities.” CEO Henry Elkus detailed Helena’s approach to partnerships in an interview with <a href="The%20European%20%282009%20magazine%29">The European Magazine</a>, saying “we only partner with outside organizations that directly work with Helena on its projects and ideas.”

Boston Consulting Group.
In October 2016, Helena and <a href="Boston%20Consulting%20Group">Boston Consulting Group</a> <a href="The%20Boston%20Consulting%20Group">(BCG)</a> announced the formation of a strategic partnership “aimed at developing and guiding Helena’s social-impact projects and initiatives.” <a href="Boston%20Consulting%20Group">BCG</a> offers Helena “support from its management consulting practices and BCG Digital Ventures, the firm’s corporate venture and incubation arm.” <a href="Boston%20Consulting%20Group">BCG</a> senior partner Jeff Hill described Helena as “a dynamic organization that shares our mission of ‘shaping the future, together.’”

<a href="Boston%20Consulting%20Group">BCG</a> also supported The Helena Prize, a prize award designed to spur and reward innovation in cleantech among young entrepreneurs. The Helena Prize was awarded in May 2017 to Climeworks, a <a href="Carbon%20capture%20and%20storage">carbon capture</a> company based in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.

Helena CEO Henry Elkus and COO Samuel Feinburg also serve as the <a href="Boston%20Consulting%20Group">Boston Consulting Group</a>’s Social Entrepreneurs in Residence.

RAND Corporation.
In mid-2017, Helena partnered with the <a href="RAND%20Corporation">RAND Corporation</a> to develop “new ways to approach global security in the 21st century, with a particular focus on the identification of the leaders, policies, and technologies that will shape the field.” Helena’s Security Council works closely with <a href="RAND">RAND</a> on initiatives covering <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="nuclear%20security">nuclear security</a>, and <a href="additive%20manufacturing">additive manufacturing</a>.

Berggruen Institute.
The <a href="Berggruen%20Institute">Berggruen Institute</a> is an independent, <a href="nonpartisan">nonpartisan</a> think tank which develops ideas to shape political and social institutions. The Institute was founded and is led by Helena Member <a href="Nicolas%20Berggruen">Nicolas Berggruen</a>. Helena works with the Berggruen Institute to develop and analyze policy solutions that affect political and social institutions, with a focus on how governments can evolve in response to 21st century technology trends and globalization. Helena CEO Henry Elkus is listed as a “special advisor” to the <a href="Berggruen%20Institute">Berggruen Institute</a>.

Criticism.
Helena has been criticized for its complexity and secrecy. Before Helena’s public launch, the organization was the subject of scrutiny from internet tabloids and blogs, who questioned the group’s purpose and existence. Several publications expressed frustration at their inability to uncover details about Helena’s structure, operations, or its members. Technology website <a href="TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a> lauded the group’s “serious firepower” and philanthropic goals but characterized Helena’s launch strategy as “a mistake.”

Helena has since been criticized for its lack of transparency. The group’s meetings are closed to the public, and some of its projects are private or as of yet undisclosed. Helena executives have been questioned in interviews about Helena’s alleged complexity and elitism. <a href="Forbes">Forbes</a> quotes CEO Henry Elkus as conceding the criticism of complexity, arguing that Helena’s elaborate design is an asset rather than a flaw: “(we) chose to create an organization that doesn’t limit itself to one particular field, and acts not only as a think-tank, but as a networking group, an R&D lab, and an operating charity.”

Media on Ram Bahadur Bomjon's controversies

"<a href="Ram%20Bahadur%20Bomjon">Ram Bahadur Bamjan</a>, who is said to have been continuously meditating since 2005 and has been nicknamed the Buddha Boy, has been in the news of late for all the wrong reasons." (The Himalayan Times, Buddha Boy turns violent‚ thrashes siblings, April 3, 2012)

<a href="Ram%20Bahadur%20Bomjon">Ram Bahadur Bomjon</a> is a popular Nepalese Buddhist religious leader, who had achieved a celebrity status due to his motionless <a href="meditation">meditation</a> as well as well-known controversies. From his early years of a public meditation performance in 2005 until 2012, when he had been <a href="http%3A//archive.is/kKld1">evicted</a> by local authorities from his ashram based in Halkhoriya Jungle, his actions had been regularly recorded in the Nepalese and the international media. The organization formed from Ram Bomjon's devotees, <a href="https%3A//www.nepalyp.com/company/31519/Bodhi_Shrawan_Dharma_Sangha">Bodhi Shrawan Dharma Sangha (BSDS)</a> <a href="http%3A//www.ic.org/directory/bodhi-shrawan-dharma-sangha/">(US branch)</a> has typical signs of a religious <a href="cult">cult</a> and their <a href="Guru%20Gobind%20Singh">guru</a> is leading them in a tight authoritative manner. One of the tools used by <a href="religious%20cult">religious cult</a>s is to influence the media publishing about them. On 21 March, 2012 five journalists, investigating the disappearance of a Slovak woman (<a href="https%3A//forum.culteducation.com/read.php%3F12%2C115955">Disappearances in India, Asia Nepal</a> ) in his Halkhoriya Jungle compound, had been attacked by his attendants (<a href="http%3A//archive.is/6fv7c">Bamjan’s boys go unruly‚ beat up journos</a>) . In the same year the mainstream Nepalese media in English stopped to cover his further controversial activity. Only local Nepali language news media and a few expat Nepali media continued to scarcely publish about Nepal's unusually behaving '<a href="Buddha%20Boy">Buddha Boy</a>'.

Violence against media.
Five Journalists Beaten Up, misbehaved (22 March 2012).
"Five journalists have been beaten up and verbally abused in <a href="Bara%20District">Bara</a>, a district in the southern plain in the central region of Nepal on March 21, 2012.The followers and protectors of <a href="Ram%20Bahadur%20Bomjon">Ram Bahadur Bamjan</a> who is claimed to be little Buddha for his years long meditation and seclusion beat up journalists while taking photographs of  Bamjan as he was being made public for sermon.Talking to Freedom Forum's Media Monitoring Desk, Bibhu Adhikari, reporter with the <a href="News%2024%20%28Nepal%29">News 24</a> television said, "Although we (I, Resham Tiwari of <a href="Nepal%20Television">Nepal Television</a>, Binod Pyakurel of <a href="Terai%20Television">Tarai Television</a>, Basanta Khatiwada of Ghatana Ra Bichar weekly and Prakash Lamsalof <a href="Image%20Channel">Image Television</a>) were called to make news, some of the followers and protectors including Darshan Limbu, Bolhari Rai, and a German national* beat us, seized our cameras and damaged the reels while taking photographs about Bamjan who was being made public for sermon after meditation." The followers of Bamjan also spoke foul on them, he said, adding that they reached to the police for help. It is the latest incident as a series of attack and threats on journalists from different quarters. The incident is condemnable as it is the incident of press freedom violation. The local administration needs to mete out action on those who beat up journalists so that it would help minimize impunity and make journalists feel justice".(*The "German national" was actually Bomjon's <a href="Polish%20nation">Polish</a> disciple Tomasz Henryk Tarnawski , as the <a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4OqhOnbzNuU">Himalaya TV documentary</a> (from 9:55 min. and from 11:48 min.) and <a href="http%3A//2.bp.blogspot.com/-vCGc_RD8F6c/T2ofjjLOQsI/AAAAAAAACUE/ua3QVgMLkZs/s1600/halkhoriya.jpg">this</a> <a href="http%3A//archive.is/tY5G6">Prateek Daily photo</a> about the incident show.)

The article was also published on <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20160305023124/http%3A/www.nepalelectionchannel.org/english/media-watch/press-freedom-violation/324-five-journalists-beaten-up-misbehaved.html">Nepal Election Channel</a>, but the website is closed down.

Censorship.
The English language Nepalese articles, television news shots and documentaries, dealing with Ram Bomjon's controversies, had been and continue to be scrupulously deleted from their home sites on the Internet,  apparently due to <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>'s political supporters like <a href="Mani%20Lama">Mani Lama</a>, an ex health-minister of the <a href="Gyanendra%20of%20Nepal">King Gyanendra</a>-led Government of Nepal, <a href="http%3A//www.kamalamaimun.gov.np/en/node/51">Chhatra Ghising</a> and newly also a high Government employee <a href="http%3A//uems.org.np/dashboard/content/11">Prem Singh Maharjan</a> as well as due to the support from various <a href="Tamang%20people">Tamang</a> organizations and political parties of Nepal's indigenous people (<a href="NEFIN">NEFIN</a>, AJRA), as well as a few hundreds of Western followers. In October 2014 <a href="Ram%20Bahadur%20Bomjon">Ram Bahadur Bomjon</a> <a href="http%3A//www.nepalmountainnews.com/cms/archives/77551">met</a> the late ex-Prime Minister of Nepal, <a href="Sushil%20Koirala">Sushil Koirala</a> . Numerous petitions had been written to the Nepalese Government and human rights organizations initiated by the European and US members of the <a href="http%3A//www.ic.org/directory/bodhi-shrawan-dharma-sangha/">BSDS</a> branches to stop, what is seen as a "media harassment" of their guru. "<a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Bomjon</a>'s Nepali followers and supporters do not tolerate any question about his divine powers after seeing such educated foreigners consider him a god, materials about him in the international media, and the then prime minister <a href="Sushil%20Koirala">Sushil Koirala</a> receive "<a href="Khata">khada</a>" (a holy shawl used by <a href="Buddhism">Buddhists</a>) and blessings from him."

Currently very few Nepalese English online and printed media are informing about his controversial activity. Instead, the mainstream <a href="Media%20of%20Nepal">media in Nepal</a> (for example <a href="The%20Himalayan%20Times">The Himalayan Times</a>, <a href="Ekantipur.com">Ekantipur</a>, <a href="Avenues%20TV">Avenues TV</a>) is <a href="Self-censorship">self-censoring</a> itself and recently some mainstream television channels even started to show Bomjon is the light of Nepal's respected religious leader: <a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzTq-J8iddCg%26amp%3Bfeature%3Dyoutu.be">Avenues TV</a> <a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8Ga9jQMqxPc">News 24</a> <a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-LkvNuNeYHE">Himalaya TV</a> 

Non-mainstream media articles in Nepalese like <a href="http%3A//www.prateekdaily.com/">Prateek Daily</a>, <a href="http%3A//nijgadh.com/">Nijdagh.com</a>, <a href="http%3A//www.souryadaily.com/">Sourya Daily</a> had not suffered much censorship, because the main targets of <a href="Ram%20Bahadur%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>'s <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> are foreigners and crowds of illiterate <a href="Tamang%20people">Tamang</a> villagers, none of these belonging among the readers of Nepalese language local media. On the other hand, English written news websites of the <a href="Expatriate">expat</a> Nepalese communities abroad, like <a href="http%3A//www.nepaljapan.com/">Nepal-Japan</a>, <a href="http%3A//www.scotnepal.com/">Scot Nepal</a> etc. had been also only partially effected by the censorship (for example <a href="http%3A//www.dcnepal.com/">DC Nepal</a> and <a href="http%3A//www.canadanepal.info/">Canada Nepal</a> had deleted their controversial articles, possibly due to the "pressure"  of Bomjon's US and Canadian followers). 

After the mysterious deaths of two people (<a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20170809154212/https%3A/www.facebook.com/BTMCNEPAL/photos/a.471358893057150.1073741828.288314338028274/536665793193126/%3Ftype%3D3%26amp%3Btheater">Manomaya Tamang</a>, and a retired US psychologist) in the premises connected to <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a> and surrounded by his followers, there is apparently a growing need in Nepal again, to balance the one-sided cultist propaganda which is hiding his more than 10 years of controversial deeds, and to enable the wide public to make an intelligent choice, based on pragmatic, truthful and complex information. Recently, some media had attempted to break the five-year long "taboo" and although very carefully, did question <a href="Ram%20Bahadur%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>'s actions:

The Setopati interview.
Setopati Online Digital Media had published in interview with <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>'s follower <a href="Mani%20Lama">Mani Lama</a>, who had practically confessed that <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a> had "hands in the death" of his own sister <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20170809154212/https%3A/www.facebook.com/BTMCNEPAL/photos/a.471358893057150.1073741828.288314338028274/536665793193126/%3Ftype%3D3%26amp%3Btheater">Manomaya Tamang</a> (Manu), a nun, and apparently caused another person's "nervous breakdown":"Bomjon and his followers have already started to show the tendency to go beyond the laws to remove the hurdles in their path. This tendency may develop as a threat in the long run. Bomjon has taken 'internal action' against a person who had stayed together with him in the jungle in Bara, according to a follower of him. "He is roaming restlessly confused about whether to live or die," the follower says. 'Guru' took the 'internal action' not physically but using his divine powers, the follower claims. The follower adds Bomjon's elder sister has also faced the wrath of 'internal action'. "She later died a painful death." The follower says 'Guru' teaches physical exercise akin to martial arts to his close disciples. "Guru and the disciples leap very high. We watch dumbfounded," he adds."
Efforts to install the 'Next Buddha'.
From the early years of <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>'s publicity (2005), followers and various authors had been speculating if he could be the "Next Buddha" of Nepal:

<a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20091229153633/http%3A/www.digitaljournal.com/article/284464">The Next Buddha? Buddha Boy Tapaswi Palden Dorje – Ram Bahadur Bomjon</a>

The <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a> documentary "" had accidentally played into the cards of the growing <a href="brainwashing">brainwashing</a> cult to present him as a miraculous new <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a> (emphasizing his alleged <a href="inedia">inedia</a>), and bring about a massive worship. 

<a href="Ram%20Bahadur%20Bomjon">Ram Bahadur Bomjon</a> had also announced himself to be the <a href="Maitreya%20Buddha">Maitreya Buddha</a> (one of his many self-given names being <a href="Maitreya">Maitriya</a> Guru). His <a href="Sangha">Sangha</a> continues to make efforts to create a spotless image of Nepal's "New Buddha" by clearing the Internet of negative articles and replacing them with their own "news". These efforts can be seen in creating an intriguingly similarly named "news website" (<a href="http%3A//thehimalayanvoice.blogspot.com/">The Himalayan Voice</a>) like the formerly critical media (<a href="The%20Himalayan%20Times">The Himalayan Times</a>) has. Articles, like that written by Joan Stanley Baker , <a href="http%3A//ecs.com.np/features/holistic-spiritual-ecology-launched-in-nepal">Holistic Spiritual Ecology launched in Nepal</a> and by Kishore Sherchand <a href="http%3A//thehimalayanvoice.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-buddha-boy-is-nepals-greatest-gift.html">The Buddha Boy' is Nepal's Greatest Gift to Humanity in 2500 Years</a> are typical cult <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> to balance the amount of controversial news. 

The main argument of Bomjon's Nepalese followers is that their guru is of a similar potential as was the historic Gautama Buddha, who also had been born in Nepal: <a href="http%3A//www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1024257/pg1">A Great beam of Light again from Nepal, a Buddha boy has been granted to a nation in Cruel civil war</a> 

An interview with <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>'s Nepalese follower Jas Bahadur Waiba reveals the belief of the <a href="cult">cult</a>  that their <a href="guru">guru</a> is the <a href="Maitreya%20Buddha">Maitreya Buddha</a> with a miraculous "global military power":"In the future, he will be Maitreya, the next Buddha. This is a certainty. I am confident in this because I have witnessed how he mixes peace with power. He can destroy and he can create. I cannot give you all the details at this time because I have been sworn to secrecy with respect to some matters.” He later hinted, however, toward some <a href="esoteric">esoteric</a> power that could possibly render the weapons of the world completely useless."The Next Buddha? Buddha Boy Tapaswi Palden Dorje – Ram Bahadur Bomjon

Latest claims about Ram Bahdur Bomjon's identity:.
According to followers interviewed by <a href="https%3A//setopati.com/">Setopati</a> journalists at <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>'s <a href="http%3A//kantipur.ekantipur.com/news/2017-03-09/20170309200311.html">World Peace Maitri Puja in Kathmandu in 2017</a>, the growing cult is modifying its <a href="dogma">dogma</a> about his identity from "Next Buddha", "Maitreya" and "reincarnation of Buddha" to, currently, even Parmatma (<a href="Paramatman">Paramatma</a>), actually the highest form of God in <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, and a "Maha <a href="Bodhi">Sambodhi</a>", "higher" than <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>:"His followers consider him to be "<a href="Paramatman">Parmatma</a>" (supreme soul) and above <a href="Lord%20Buddha">Lord Buddha</a>.""But he also considers himself a "<a href="Paramatman">Parmatma</a>" incarnated to rid the world of sufferings. He plans to unite the world through a single "<a href="Maitreya">Maitri</a>" religion, "<a href="Maitreya">Maitri</a>" language and "<a href="Maitreya">Maitri</a>" culture. ""His followers claim his level of knowledge is above that of <a href="Lord%20Buddha">Lord Buddha</a>. They claim <a href="Siddhartha%20Gautam">Siddhartha Gautam</a> reached a "Sambuddha "(self-enlightened) state but <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Bomjon</a> has attained "Mahasambodhi" (greater form of self-enlightenment) state."Some even claim he has left "<a href="Sukhavati">Sukhapati</a> Bhawan" (heavenly abode where <a href="Amit%C4%81bha">Amitabh Buddha</a> is said to reside) replete with amenities and bliss, and come to the earth for the good of the world. "

Media as main enemy.
<a href="http%3A//kishoresherchand.metrolistpro.com/">Kishore Sherchand</a>, an US-Nepalese follower, had been criticizing the media for covering <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>'s deeds, and is also among those convinced that Bomjon is the coming <a href="Maitreya%20Buddha">Maitreya Buddha</a>: "I noticed some sort of disturbing noise. Later I discovered that some photographers and other media people were not allowed to take his pictures. Despite this, some of them were taking pictures. It learnt that the media people were not invited and "none were allowed to take pictures" except for those few in-house photographers because those "media people were not publishing true picture of  Guruji". One of the senior Sangha members said, the "media always tried to send wrong messages in the past".""May be the government is just at “wait and see” until some kind of overwhelming "pressure" develops, national as well as foreign. The media by and large seem to be "trying to distort" his presence as a <a href="Ram%20Bahadur%20Bomjon">Sambodhi Dharma Guru</a>, <a href="Maitreya">Maitreya</a> Guru or any other Guru <a href="Rimpoche">Rimpoche</a> fearing his discourse, spiritual strength, meditation practices have become so far and wide that it could be a growing threat to others ..."Such efforts to blame the media for reporting about a popular personality's controversial deeds, and thus harming his public image, are typical for religious cults and belong to a phenomenon called <a href="https%3A//rationalwiki.org/wiki/Hostile_media_effect">the hostile media effect</a>.

The tight "censorship" of the controversial articles and film records about "Ram Bomjon" in Nepal continues until today (2017), while, in general, the country already enjoys relatively high press freedom concerning other topics. The mere amount of the already "deleted Bomjon-related articles and TV documentaries" from the Internet is a sign that the <a href="cult">cult</a> of <a href="Ram%20Bahadur%20Bomjon">Ram Bahadur Bomjon</a> is trying to influence the media, breach <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> and re-write his own history. <a href="http%3A//setopati.net/">Setopati</a> recalls the consequent "information gap" about Bomjon, in its 2017 article:"Little has been written about <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Bomjon</a> in the Nepali media in recent years. ... A few things about him have come out through audio, visual and print medium in the foreign media instead."

Nepalese online media in English (only archives, original not available).
The Himalayan Times.
<a href="The%20Himalayan%20Times">The Himalayan Times</a> had been the most comprehensive source of information about <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>'s breaching of ethics and law. Yet after the five journalists, who went to Bomjon's Halkhoriya Jungle <a href="ashram">ashram</a> to investigate the kidnap allegations of the <a href="https%3A//forum.culteducation.com/read.php%3F12%2C115955">two disappeared women in March 2012 (a Slovak and a Nepalese)</a> mentioned above, <a href="http%3A//www.nepalpressfreedom.org/content/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Bview%3Darticle%26amp%3Bid%3D526%3Afive-journalists-beaten-up-misbehaved%26amp%3Bcatid%3D41%3Atop-headlines%26amp%3BItemid%3D120">had been physically attacked by the assistants of Bomjon</a>, the vehemence of <a href="The%20Himalayan%20Times">The Himalayan Times</a> in informing about Bomjon has ceased. New articles concerning <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a> are not published anymore, and the controversial old ones had been made inaccessible, as the below list shows. The media's internal <a href="https%3A//thehimalayantimes.com/archives/">Archives</a> page had been not launched. 

However, much older articles which show <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Bomjon</a> in a "good light", are still available, for example: <a href="https%3A//thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/drive-against-massive-animal-sacrifice-gathers-momentum/">Drive against massive animal sacrifice gathers momentum</a> An article re-published in 2016 as part of the series "THT 10 years ago" seems to have also escaped the self-censorship, possibly due to its rather "praising" content, despite its sensational title: <a href="https%3A//thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/tht-10-years-ago-teen-buddha-comes-back-armed-sword/">THT 10 years ago: Teen Buddha comes back armed with a sword</a>  <a href="http%3A//archive.is/qqcxe">Archive.is</a> <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20161231220341/https%3A//thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/tht-10-years-ago-teen-buddha-comes-back-armed-sword/">Archive.org</a>

'Buddha Boy' finds his abode of peace at Sindhuli forest (July 8, 2012).
This article of <a href="The%20Himalayan%20Times">The Himalayan Times</a> starts to show the change in this media's approach already on July 8, 2012, when they interview Darshan Limbu, the then spokesperson for <a href="Ram%20Bomjon">Ram Bomjon</a>, accused by the kidnapped Slovak victim of sexually assaulting her during her captivity in March 2012, in an interview for the <a href="Avenues%20Television">Avenues TV</a> and <a href="News%2024%20%28Nepal%29">News 24</a> television channels at <a href="Tribhuvan%20International%20Airport">Tribhuvan Airport</a> of <a href="Kathmandu">Kathmandu</a>, before leaving for Europe. In this article, Darshan Limbu downplays the brutal treatment of the victim by claiming she is "mentally disturbed". There are also signs of trying to influence the media:

"Chairman <a href="http%3A//www.kamalamaimun.gov.np/en/node/51">Chhatra Ghising</a> of <a href="https%3A//www.nepalyp.com/company/31519/Bodhi_Shrawan_Dharma_Sangha">Bodhi Shrawan Sangh</a>, responsible for Bamjan's protection, "urged the mediapersons not to give any negative press coverage"."

"I abide by the law, but only the right ones. There are "wrong laws" too. I have done no wrong," he insisted and added, "They disturbed me while I was meditating… tried to manhandle me. I was therefore forced to beat up them.”A group of 17 persons had "lodged a formal complaint" against <a href="Ram%20Bamjan">Bamjan</a> on Saturday morning claiming that he took them under control on Thursday when they reached the spot while looking for wild fruits and vegetables and thrashed them with an axe handle for around 22 hours before releasing them on Friday afternoon.Saved on <a href="http%3A//archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php%3Faction%3Dnews_details%26amp%3Bnews_id%3D21467">My Republica's archive</a>:

They took the past lesson not to evoke any negative image of Nepal's 'Buddha Boy' anymore, and filmed the crowded religious event without any criticism towards the guru's controversial past:

"Discovery Channel had been here to set up cameras, but it didn't work out and they may return again later. However when we contacted the Discovery liasion person in Kathmandu, "Carolyn Shyangbo", she said that Discovery had hoped to film for three continuous days but were only given permission to film at night from 50 meters away and their infra cameras were not good enough.

Typhoon Kent (1992)

Typhoon Kent was a mid-season typhoon that struck southern Japan during August 1992. An area of <a href="atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> developed east of the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a>. Tracking west-northwestward, a tropical depression developed on August 5, and the next day, intensified into a tropical storm. On August 8, increased vertical <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> caused convection to decrease, although the next day, Ken strengthened into a typhoon. An <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> then appeared, and on August 11, Ken attained its peak intensity. Under the influence of a subtropical ridge located to its north, the typhoon initially continued to move west-northwestward before turning turning towards Kyushu. The storm steadily weakened prior to making <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on August 18 just below typhoon intensity. The mountainous terrain of Japan accelerated the weakening trend, and on August 20, Kent dissipated.

The cyclone was the third to hit Japan during August 1992, the second highest number of storms to hit Japan in a month. The typhoon dropped heavy rainfall across western portions of the Japanese archipelago, peaking at 1,286 mm (50.6 in) in Hidegadake. Nationwide, eight fatalities were reported and two others sustained injuries. Rough seas in <a href="Tokushima%20Prefecture">Tokushima Prefecture</a> swept away five of six family members, with the six severely wounded. Another individual drowned in <a href="Kyoto%20Prefecture">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and a swimmer was injured offshore <a href="Tottori%20Prefecture">Tottori Prefecture</a>. A total 1,561 houses were destroyed while 379 others were flooded. Furthermore, two vessels were damaged. Many ferries linking <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a> and <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> were cancelled. Monetary damage totaled 1.9 billion yen ($15 million <a href="United%20States%20Dollar">USD</a>).

Meteorological history.
As Typhoon Janis, the previous storm, intensified south of Guam, the tropical disturbance that later became Typhoon Kent developed
east of the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a>. Its persistent convection prompted the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) to start following the system at 06:00 UTC on August 3. Forty-eight hours later, the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Following an increase in the amount and organization of the disturbance’s deep convection prompted JTWC to issue a <a href="Tropical%20Cyclone%20Formation%20Alert">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a> at 15:00 UTC on August 5. The storm began to a mature at a faster clip as it tracked west-northwest. The JTWC started issuing warnings three hours later, and at 00:00 UTC on August 6, the JTWC upgraded the depression into a tropical storm, with the JMA doing the same at 06:00 UTC. Eighteen hours later, the JTWC upgraded Kent to a typhoon, with the JMA declaring it a severe tropical storm.

After becoming a severe tropical storm, the rate of intensification slowed. On August 8, increased vertical wind shear associated with the passage of a <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">mid-level trough</a> to the north resulted in a reduction in the thickness of Kent’s <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">central dense overcast</a>. Even though intensification was arrested (the JTWC and JMA estimated that the storm maintained winds of and for 30 and 42 hours respectively), a small core of persistent central convection remained. As the trough passed by, the re-appearance of an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> indicated that steady intensification had returned. At noon on August 11, Kent was upgraded into a super typhoon by the JTWC. At the same time, the JTWC and JMA estimated that the typhoon attained its peak intensity of and , with a minimum <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of .

Under the influence of a <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a> located to its north, the typhoon maintained its intensity as it continued to move west-northwestward until a <a href="shortwave%20trough">shortwave trough</a> moved across Honshu on August 13. Kent subsequently slowed down and turned towards the north in response to the weakness in the subtropical ridge. Then, the trough passed by and the typhoon, which was by this time weakening due to increased <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, veered towards <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a>. On August 16, Kent began to <a href="Fujiwhara%20effect">interact</a> with <a href="1992%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season%23Tropical%20Storm%20Lois">Tropical Storm Lois</a>, which had formed two days earlier. As a consequence, Kent changed its course for <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>. On August 16, the JMA and JTWC estimated that Kent lost typhoon intensity. At 00:00 UTC on August 18, Kent moved ashore over Kyushu, with the JTWC and JMA reporting winds of and . Shortly thereafter the interaction between the tropical cyclones had ceased, and Kent was approaching recurvature. After landfall, interaction with the mountainous terrain of Kyushu, along with increased wind shear aloft, quickly weakened Kent. At midday on August 19, Kent was downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC when the center had become exposed from the deep convection. Both the JTWC and JMA ceased tracking Kent on August 20.

Impact.
Typhoon Kent was the third typhoon to hit Japan during August 1992, following <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Irving%20%281992%29">Tropical Storm Irving</a> and <a href="Typhoon%20Janis%20%281992%29">Typhoon Janis</a>. This was the second highest number of storms to hit Japan in a month. The typhoon dropped heavy rainfall across western portions of the Japanese archipelago. A peak rainfall total occurred of at Hidegadake. A peak hourly rainfall total of was observed in <a href="Mount%20Amagi">Mount Amagi</a>. Meanwhile, a peak daily precipitation total of fell in Hidegdake. A wind gust of was recorded in the city of <a href="Tosashimizu">Tosashimizu</a>. Nationwide, eight fatalities were reported and two others sustained injuries. A total 1,561 houses were destroyed while 379 others were flooded. Moreover, two vessels were damaged. Many ferries linking <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a> and <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> were cancelled. Monetary damage totaled 1.9 billion yen ($15 million USD).

Rough seas in <a href="Tokushima%20Prefecture">Tokushima Prefecture</a> swept away a family of six from the seaside with five dead
and one seriously wounded, while in a separate incident, one person perished. Thirty-six houses were damaged in the prefecture and damage was estimated at 810 million yen. In Miyazaki Prefecture, all flights and trains were canceled. Around 300 homes lost power. A total of 143 homes were damaged and 168 homes were destroyed, which resulted in 931 people homeless in <a href="Kochi%20Prefecture">Kochi Prefecture</a>.

Dive leader

Dive leader describes the minimum requirements for dive leader training and certification for <a href="Recreational%20diving">recreational scuba divers</a> in international standard ISO 24801-3 and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153-3. Various organizations offer training that meets the requirements of the dive leader standard.

Scuba dive leaders are considered competent to plan, organise and conduct dives and to lead other recreational divers on open water dives, and for specialised recreational scuba diving activities for which they have been trained. They are also considered competent to conduct emergency procedures associated with these activities and the relevant diving environment. They may require orientation for unfamiliar local environmental conditions. Additional specialised training and experience is required to lead divers on more demanding dives.

The term is also used by BSAC for a specific certification.

Scope of the standard.
International standard ISO 24801-3 includes:

Training according to ISO 24801-3.
Diver qualifications which comply with ISO 24801-3

Medical fitness to dive.
Before initial diver training and thereafter at regular intervals, a diver should undergo a <a href="fitness%20to%20dive">fitness to dive</a> examination by a diving doctor. This may be considered more important for a dive leader who has a duty of care to their clients. In some countries, such an examination is required by law and it is a prerequisite for any training in many diving schools.

Lule people

The Lule people, or Lules, are an <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous people</a> in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. They were originally encountered in the area that is now the <a href="Salta%20Province">Salta Province</a> of Argentina, as well as in nearby areas of modern-day <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>. They were later displaced by the <a href="Wich%C3%AD">Wichí</a> toward the south of Salta Province, the north-east of <a href="Santiago%20del%20Estero%20Province">Santiago del Estero Province</a>, and the north of <a href="Tucum%C3%A1n%20Province">Tucumán Province</a>. The <a href="Lule%20language">Lule language</a> is distantly related to the <a href="Vilela%20language">Vilela language</a>, and together they form the <a href="Lule-Vilela%20languages">Lule-Vilela language family</a>. Today, 3,721 people in Argentina claim Lule ethnic affiliation, according to the 2010 census.

History.
The Lules lived in the same region as the <a href="Vilela%20people">Vilela</a>, and shared many cultural characteristics despite linguistic differences. They also had relationships with the <a href="Tonocot%C3%A9">Tonocoté</a> and the <a href="Mataraes">Mataraes</a>. The Lule people were made up of the following groups: Esistiné, Tokistiné, Oristiné, Axostiné, Tamboriné, Guaxastiné, and Casutiné.

The Lules were generally <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a>s and therefore lived a <a href="nomad">nomad</a>ic lifestyle. However, they also cultivated a wide variety of plants for food, including <a href="maize">maize</a>, <a href="calabaza">calabaza</a>, <a href="potato">potato</a>, and <a href="quinoa">quinoa</a>. Sedentary populations settled down on the western edges of the modern-day city of <a href="Salta">Salta</a>. In these settlements, a clear <a href="Andes">Andean</a> influence on their culture and way of life can be established. One major example of this Andean cultural influence is the domestication of animals in the <a href="lamini">lamini</a> family for use as pack animals and for the production of wool and meat.

In order to convert them to Christianity, the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuits</a> founded a <a href="mission">mission</a> near <a href="Lules">San Isidro de Lules</a> in Tucumán province in 1670. This mission remained active until 1768, when the Jesuits were expelled. During the mission's existence, it often traded and sold the Lule and <a href="Diaguita">Diaguita</a> indigenous population of the area to members of the landed oligarchy, plantations, and colonial workshops.

In 1708, <a href="Esteban%20de%20Ur%C3%ADzar">Esteban de Urízar</a>, the governor of Tucumán, carried out a punitive campaign against the indigenous peoples of the <a href="Gran%20Chaco">Gran Chaco</a>, including the Lules. Following that campaign, Jesuits from Salta established a mission, San Juan Bautista de Balbuena, next to Fort Balbuena. The mission was home to 400 Lules, primarily from the the Esistiné and Tokistiné groups. On August 7, 1715, Father Antonio Machoni moved the mission to Fort Miraflores, establishing the mission of San Esteban de Miraflores on the banks of the <a href="Salado%20River%20%28Argentina%29">Salado River</a>. Thirteen years later, in 1728, natives destroyed the mission in a rebellion; the Lules left the mission and dispersed throughout the land. In 1752, the mission was restored but in a different location, to the south-east of the city of Salta. After the Jesuits were expelled in 1768, the mission passed into <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> control, but it became permanently abandoned by the turn of the nineteenth century.

Today.
The descendants of the Lules have partly, but incompletely, mixed and acculturated into the <a href="Argentines%20of%20European%20descent">predominantly white</a> population and culture of Argentina. In the following settlements, there are a number of residents who identify themselves as belonging to the Lule people:


The 2004-2005 Complementary Indigenous Survey identified 854 Argentines of first-generation Lule descent. The 2010 Argentine Census identified 3,721 individuals who identified as being of Lule ethnicity.

Bogdan Rață

Bogdan Rață (; born January 22, 1984) is a <a href="Romania">Romania</a>n sculptor best known for his twisted, contorted and mutated versions of the human body. Rață lives and works in <a href="Timi%C8%99oara">Timișoara</a> and <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>.

Education.
Rață studied sculpture at the <a href="West%20University%20of%20Timi%C8%99oara">West University of Timișoara</a> (2003-2006). In 2008 he got his M.A. in sculpture at the <a href="Bucharest%20National%20University%20of%20Arts">Bucharest National University of Arts</a> and in 2012 his PhD at the <a href="West%20University%20of%20Timi%C8%99oara">West University of Timișoara</a>.

Work.
In his early years of Rață's artistic work he used his own body as a model. Subsequently, he continued his work in the form of large-scale studies of different body fragments; with quasi-surgical accuracy, he carved out his arms, feet, elbows and torsos, which he later juxtaposed, juggling with sometimes oversized proportions such as "Handgun", exhibited in Bucharest and later in Paris at the Farideh Cadot Gallery. The combinations give rise to new forms, hybrid and often "absurd" sculptures.

Rață is focused mainly on human anatoforms. Using polyester, paint, metal and synthetic resin he twists, deforms and shapes human bodies forming hybrid and grotesque anatomic mutations.

His works represents deformed and hideous human bodies or parts of it. Rață is interested in the issues of perception and human figure in sculpture:

I work with human fragments which I combine in order to create images with a strong emotional impact: frustration, fright, shame. I reinterpret the human body precisely in order to induce a state of confusion to the reader and to in a way force him to understand, from a different perspective, the contemporary human being. A finger can be stronger than a rifle, an ear more frustrating than an interrogation.

Often, he mixes different body parts like fingers, foot, head and torsos: "Punk" (2008), "Torsso" (2008), "Lonely" (2011), "The Cure" (2010), "Tits" (2010), "The Middle Way" (2014), "The Pressure" (2015) etc. He also uses twisted trunks or faceless bodies: "Shame" (2009), "Trying to Keep Life" (2012) and "The Lake" (2015).

Teaching.
Besides his artistic career, Rață is also a lecturer at the <a href="West%20University%20of%20Timisoara">West University of Timisoara</a>.

Exhibitions.
Since 2007, Rață's work has been exhibited both nationally, in Timișoara, <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, <a href="Sibiu">Sibiu</a>, <a href="Baia%20Mare">Baia Mare</a> and internationally in Liverpool (UK), Paris (France), New York (U.S.), Moscow and St. Petersburg (Russia), Venice (Italy), Tel Aviv (Israel), Cascais (Portugal) and Budapest (Hungary).

Sans Frontieres

Sans Frontieres (foaled 6 April 2006) is an Irish-bred, British-trained <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> racehorse and <a href="Horse%20breeding%23Terminology">sire</a>. In his first two seasons he showed promise but was restricted to only three races in total owing to injuries. As a four-year-old in 2010 he emerged as a top-class performer over middle and long distances, winning the <a href="Princess%20of%20Wales%27s%20Stakes">Princess of Wales's Stakes</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20Freer%20Stakes">Geoffrey Freer Stakes</a> in England and then recording his biggest victory in his final race when he took the <a href="Irish%20St%20Leger">Irish St Leger</a> at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh</a>. Leg injuries kept him off the course for the next two years before he was retired to become a breeding stallion.

Background.
Sans Frontieres is a chestnut horse with a white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">blaze</a> and four white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">socks</a> bred in Ireland by the Lavington Stud. As a <a href="yearling%20%28horse%29">yearling</a> he was offered for sale at <a href="Tattersalls">Tattersalls</a> in October 2007 and was bought for 450,000 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> by the bloodstock agent John Warren. He entered the ownership of Sir Robert Ogden, best known as an owner of <a href="National%20Hunt">National Hunt</a> horses including <a href="See%20More%20Business">See More Business</a>, <a href="Voy%20Por%20Ustedes">Voy Por Ustedes</a> and <a href="Exotic%20Dancer%20%28horse%29">Exotic Dancer</a>. The colt was sent into training with <a href="Jeremy%20Noseda">Jeremy Noseda</a> at <a href="Newmarket%2C%20Suffolk">Newmarket</a>.

He was sired by <a href="Galileo%20%28horse%29">Galileo</a>, who won the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Derby</a>, <a href="Irish%20Derby">Irish Derby</a> and <a href="King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20Stakes">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes</a> in 2001 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. Galileo's other progeny include <a href="Cape%20Blanco%20%28horse%29">Cape Blanco</a>, <a href="Frankel%20%28horse%29">Frankel</a>, <a href="Nathaniel%20%28horse%29">Nathaniel</a>, <a href="New%20Approach">New Approach</a>, <a href="Rip%20Van%20Winkle%20%28horse%29">Rip Van Winkle</a>, <a href="Found%20%28horse%29">Found</a>, <a href="Minding%20%28horse%29">Minding</a> and <a href="Ruler%20of%20the%20World">Ruler of the World</a>. Sans Frontieres' dam Llia, who won one minor race and finished third in the <a href="Pretty%20Polly%20Stakes%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Pretty Polly Stakes</a>, and produced seer other winners including Hans Holbein (<a href="Chester%20Vase">Chester Vase</a>) and Kootenay (<a href="Princess%20Elizabeth%20Stakes">Princess Elizabeth Stakes</a>). Llia was a distant female-line descendant of the broodmare Clarence (foaled 1934), and was therefore related to many leading winners including <a href="Sun%20Chariot%20%28horse%29">Sun Chariot</a> and <a href="Santa%20Claus%20%28horse%29">Santa Claus</a>.

Racing career.
2008: two-year-old season.
Sans Frontieres began his racing career in a <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> over seven <a href="furlongs">furlongs</a> at <a href="Lingfield%20Park">Lingfield Park</a> on 1 September in which he started the <a href="Fractional%20odds">5/6</a> favourite against nine opponents. Ridden by Shane Kelly, he took the lead inside the final furlong and won from Rafaan, Admiral Duque and Beat Up in a "blanket finish" which saw the first four finishing within half a length of each other.

2009: three-year-old season.
On his three-year-old debut Sans Frontieres was ridden by <a href="Johnny%20Murtagh">Johnny Murtagh</a> in the <a href="Craven%20Stakes">Craven Stakes</a> (a trial race for the <a href="2000%20Guineas">2000 Guineas</a>) over one mile at <a href="Newmarket%20Racecourse">Newmarket Racecourse</a> on 16 April in which he at odds of 12/1 and finished second of the seven runners behind the odds-on favourite Delegator. On 14 May at <a href="York%20Racecourse">York Racecourse</a> the colt was stepped up in distance for the <a href="Dante%20Stakes">Dante Stakes</a>, a major trial for the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a> in which he was partnered by <a href="Mick%20Kinane">Mick Kinane</a>. After racing towards the rear of the field he stayed on strongly in the straight to take third place beat three uarters of a <a href="Horse%20length">length</a> and a head by the <a href="Aidan%20O%27Brien">Aidan O'Brien</a>-trained colts <a href="Black%20Bear%20Island">Black Bear Island</a> and Freemantle. Sans Frontieres had training problem after his run in the Dante and missed the rest of the season.

2010: four-year-old season.
After a break of eleven months, Sans Frontieres returned in the <a href="Group%20races">Group 3</a> <a href="Earl%20of%20Sefton%20Stakes">Earl of Sefton Stakes</a> over nine furlongs at Newmarket in April in which he was partnered by <a href="Frankie%20Dettori">Frankie Dettori</a> and finished sixth of the eight runner behind Sri Putra. In the <a href="Huxley%20Stakes">Huxley Stakes</a> at <a href="Chester%20Racecourse">Chester Racecourse</a> in May he again failed to make much impact and finished sixth behind <a href="Debussy%20%28horse%29">Debussy</a>.

At <a href="Royal%20Ascot">Royal Ascot</a> on 19 June the colt was ridden by <a href="Tom%20Queally">Tom Queally</a> when he was stepped up in distance and started a 25/1 outsider for the <a href="Hardwicke%20Stakes">Hardwicke Stakes</a> over one and a half miles. He never looked likely to win but kept on well in the closing stages to finish fourth behind <a href="Harbinger%20%28horse%29">Harbinger</a> despite having some problems obtaining clear run in the straight. Nineteen days after his run at Ascot Sans Frontieres, with Queally again in the saddle, started at odds of 14/1 in an eight-runner field for the Princess of Wales's Stakes on <a href="Going%20%28horse%20racing%29">good to firm ground</a> at Newmarket. <a href="Spanish%20Moon">Spanish Moon</a> started favourite while the other runners included <a href="Crowded%20House%20%28horse%29">Crowded House</a>, Holberg (winner of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Vase">Queen's Vase</a>), Tazeez (<a href="Earl%20of%20Sefton%20Stakes">Earl of Sefton Stakes</a>) and <a href="Man%20of%20Iron%20%28horse%29">Man of Iron</a>. After being restrained by Queally in the early stages he moved up to take the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on well to win by two and a half lengths from the <a href="Barry%20Hills">Barry Hills</a>-trained Redwood, with another two and a half lengths back to Tazeez in third place. After the race Jeremy Noseda said "I came here thinking he'd finish in the three but I didn't think he'd beat Spanish Moon. But if Spanish Moon didn't perform, he'd have as good a chance as anything. I didn't expect to win, so hadn't looked much beyond today, but hopefully there will be a better day ahead".

In the Group 2 Geoffrey Freer Stakes on softer ground at <a href="Newbury%20Racecourse">Newbury Racecourse</a> Sans Frontieres was ridden by Murtagh and started the 3/1 second choice in the betting behind the <a href="Godolphin%20Racing">Godolphin</a> repreentative Kite Wood, the winner of the race in 2009. The other six runners included Laaheb (<a href="Fred%20Archer%20Stakes">Fred Archer Stakes</a>) and Golden Sword (<a href="Chester%20Vase">Chester Vase</a>). After tracking the leaders Sans Frontieres went to the front approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by two and a quarter lengths from Laaheb despite hanging to the right. Noseda commented "To be honest I was very worried about the ground but I chatted to Sir Robert Ogden and we decided to go for it. I was fairly worried he wouldn't go on it, but we had to find out today because we've had the Irish St Leger on our minds and there's a good chance it will be soft there. So it will be the Irish St Leger next and hopefully after that, we can have a tilt at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a>".

As predicted, Sans Frontieres was next sent to Ireland and was moved up in class and distance for the Group 1 Irish St Leger over one and three quarter miles at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh</a> on 11 September. Ridden by <a href="Olivier%20Peslier">Olivier Peslier</a> he was made the 13/8 favourite against seven runners headed by the six-year-old mare Profound Beauty whose wins included the <a href="Curragh%20Cup">Curragh Cup</a> and two editions of the <a href="Ballyroan%20Stakes">Ballyroan Stakes</a>. Kite Wood was again in opposition, as well as Tactic (Curragh Cup) and the Japanese challenger <a href="Pop%20Rock%20%28horse%29">Pop Rock</a>. The outsider Lady Lupus set the pace and saw off a short-lived challenge from Tactic to lead the field into the straight. Peslier meanwhile, had settled his mount in seventh place before moving up on the outside entering the straight. Profound Beauty went to the front a furlong and a half out but was soon joined by Sans Frontieres who gained the advantage before drawing ahead to win "comfortably" by three quarters of a length. Robert Ogden's racing manager Barry Simpson said "He didn't like the ground at all, but he did his best bit of work ever last week and I know Jeremy would have thought him a certainty on good ground, but all the rain dampened our enthusiasm", before going on to echo Noseda's statement that the Melbourne Cup was a likely target.

After some deliberation, the horse went into <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> in preparation for a trip to Australia. The plans were abandoned, however, after he developed a muscular problem ("<a href="azoturia">azoturia</a>") following a training gallop on 5 October.

Retirement.
Sans Frontieres sustained a tendon injury in 2011 which kept him off the track for the whole of the year. Noseda persevered with the horse but when the injury recurred in 2012, Sans Frontieres was retired from racing. The trainer commented "He was due to run at Newbury later this month and had been working very well, showing his customary dash. So it is a great shame that he has had a recurrence of a tendon injury. Sans Frontieres was a very talented horse who, without question, would have won more Group 1s with a little more luck."

Stud career.
Sans Frontieres began his stud career at the <a href="Coolmore%20Stud">Coolmore</a> organisation's Beeches Stud in <a href="County%20Waterford">County Waterford</a> where he is marketed as a <a href="National%20Hunt">National Hunt</a> stallion.

He was born on April 10, 1953, in <a href="High%20Point%2C%20North%20Carolina">High Point, North Carolina</a>.

He wrote for the "<a href="The%20Herald-Sun%20%28Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina%29">Durham Morning Herald</a>" and the "Legal Times of Washington" and served as an attorney for the Kentucky Legislative Research Commission before joining the "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald-Leader</a>" in 1979. Three years later, he became the paper's Washington correspondent. It was during this time that, along with Jeffrey A. Marx, he authored "Playing Above the Rules," a series of articles exposing improper cash payoffs to <a href="Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">UK basketball players</a> and improper offers made to recruits by other universities. The authors interviewed 33 former Wildcats – some of whom spoke to Marx and York with the goal of ending the abuses – and the paper sued the university and the state of Kentucky under freedom of information laws to get detailed information, including the names of specific violators, for the series. Initially, the response was strongly negative: subscribers and advertisers boycotted the "Herald-Leader", local media outlets heavily criticized the outlet and accused it of "sensationalism," and the authors received death threats. However, the piece earned Marx and York the 1986 <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Investigative%20Reporting">Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting</a> and led to <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> regulation changes.

She was nicknamed ""Queen of Palermo"".

Biography.
Ancestry and marriage.
Francesca Paola Jacona della Motta was born in Palermo on 27 December 1873. She belonged to an impoverished family of the Sicilian high aristocracy. Her father was Pietro Jacona della Motta, baron of San Giuliano, and her mother was Costanza Notarbartolo di Villarosa, sister of Pietro <a href="Notarbartolo">Notarbartolo</a>, duke of <a href="Villarosa">Villarosa</a>. Her maternal ancestry also included the <a href="House%20of%20Montcada">House of Montcada</a> and the <a href="Lucchesi-Palli">Lucchesi-Palli</a>, princes of <a href="Campofranco">Campofranco</a>.

Despite the impoverishment of the family, the prestigious ancestry of Donna Franca made her a good catch, especially in the eyes of the Sicilian high bourgeoisie looking for nobility. Therefore, on 11 February 1893, at the age of 19, Franca married the entrepreneur and shipowner Ignazio Florio Jr., hier of the Florio family's economic empire. The assets of Ignazio Florio Jr. included the Florio winery (leading company in the production of "Marsala" wine), the majority of the Sicilian tuna traps, the "Oretea" foundry, the Florio Bank (previously belonging to the <a href="Rothschild">Rothschild</a> family), and a large fleet comprising yachts and steamships.

Belle Époque and social life.
After her marriage with Ignazio Florio Jr., Donna Franca became a prominent figure of the <a href="Europe">European</a> social life. In the early 20th century, thanks to the influence of the Florio family, Sicily (especially Palermo and the town of <a href="Taormina">Taormina</a>) was an important meeting place for the European wealthiest elite. With her yachts called "Sultana" and "Aegusa", Donna Franca was able to attend the social life not only in Sicily, but even in the <a href="C%C3%B4te%20d%27Azur">Côte d'Azur</a>. Other places frequented by Donna Franca were <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, etc. In 1902 she became <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a> of the <a href="Queen%20consort%20of%20Italy">Queen consort of Italy</a> <a href="Elena%20of%20Montenegro">Elena of Montenegro</a>.

Donna Franca was also an art patron. She was a friend of the Italian writer and poet <a href="Gabriele%20D%27Annunzio">Gabriele D'Annunzio</a>, leading figure of the <a href="Decadent%20movement">Decadent movement</a> in Italy, who described her as "a unique woman. A creature whose every movement possesses a divine rhythm". In 1901 Donna Franca met the painter <a href="Giovanni%20Boldini">Giovanni Boldini</a>, an internationally renowned portraitist who used to work especially in Paris and London. Therefore, Boldini painted the famous ""Portrait of Franca Florio"". Other artists connected to her were the dialect poet <a href="Trilussa">Trilussa</a>, the composers <a href="Pietro%20Mascagni">Pietro Mascagni</a> and <a href="Ruggero%20Leoncavallo">Ruggero Leoncavallo</a>, the painter <a href="Ettore%20De%20Maria%20Bergler">Ettore De Maria Bergler</a>, the sculptor <a href="Pietro%20Canonica">Pietro Canonica</a>, the novelist <a href="Matilde%20Serao">Matilde Serao</a> and the <a href="France">French</a> <a href="dandy">dandy</a> <a href="Robert%20de%20Montesquiou">Robert de Montesquiou</a>. 

In the same years, Franca Florio also met the <a href="German%20Emperor">German Emperor</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II</a>, who became one of her most prestigious admirers. He nicknamed Donna Franca with the appellation of ""<a href="Star%20of%20Italy">Star of Italy</a>"" due to her beauty. Subsequently, the Emperor and his wife, <a href="Augusta%20Victoria%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein">Augusta Victoria</a>, went various times to Palermo. In her palace in Palermo Donna Franca also welcomed the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British</a> King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a> and his wife, <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra of Denmark</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20Russian%20consorts">Russian Empress</a> <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Alexandra Feodorovna</a>, the <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</a>, as far as celebrities like <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, <a href="Greta%20Garbo">Greta Garbo</a>, <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace Kelly</a> and <a href="Maria%20Callas">Maria Callas</a>.

Last years and death.

She died on 10 November 1950 and was buried in the <a href="Cemetery%20of%20Santa%20Maria%20di%20Ges%C3%B9">Cemetery of Santa Maria di Gesù</a>, Palermo.

Cultural depiction.
The famous <a href="Giovanni%20Boldini">Giovanni Boldini</a>'s ""Portrait of Franca Florio"" was commissioned by Ignazio Florio. Boldini’s initial, beautifully provocative version, painted in 1901 was not approved of by Ignazio Florio. He reportedly found it risqué and "unnatural and unreal" looking and demanded that Boldini lengthen the dress and add full sleeves with wide black lace. Once Boldini had reworked the work to oblige his commissioner’s discontent it was exhibited at the 1903 <a href="Venice%20Biennial">Venice Biennial</a>. The portrait remained like this until 1924 when, with the demise of the Florio family’s wealth, Baron Maurice de Rothschild acquired it. Therefore, Rothschild engaged Boldini to restore it to its original sensual version. After two auction (<a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> 1995 and <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> 2005), the painting has been on display at the Grand Hotel Villa Igiea in Palermo since 2006. In 2017 it gone to auction again.

Ramisyllis multicaudata

Ramisyllis multicaudata is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="polychaete">polychaete</a> worm in the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Syllidae">Syllidae</a>. It was found in <a href="Darwin%20Harbour">Darwin Harbour</a>, Australia, where it was living within the tissues of a sponge of the genus "<a href="Petrosia">Petrosia</a>". It was the second branching species of polychaete worm to have been discovered, the first having been "<a href="Syllis%20ramosa">Syllis ramosa</a>", a deep water species, more than a century earlier.

Description.
This worm inhabits the interior of a sponge and except for the tips of its branches, is not visible to the naked eye. It is cylindrical, about 1mm in diameter and up to in length. The head is buried deep in the sponge and is difficult to locate during a dissection of the sponge. It has three antennae, two pairs of eyes, a pair of palps and two pairs of tentacular cirri. The body is fragile and easily broken in pieces. The dorsal <a href="Cirrus%20%28biology%29">cirri</a> (thread-like growths) on the body segments are elongated and sometimes of unequal length; they are articulated while the ventral cirri are short and conical and not articulated. The <a href="chaeta">chaeta</a>e (bristles) are simple and shaped somewhat like <a href="tomahawk">tomahawk</a>s. Some branches of the worm develop into stolons, reproductive elements that contain the eggs or sperm and which later become detached from the parent worm. Molecular evidence from <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">rDNA</a> indicates that "R. multicaudata" and "S. ramosa" have evolved a branching habit independently of each other; in the latter case, the worm initiates branching from a <a href="parapodium">parapodium</a> whereas in the former, an area between the parapodia is involved.

Distribution.
"R. multicaudata" was found living <a href="symbiosis">symbiotically</a> inside both white and purple sponges of the "<a href="Petrosia">Petrosia</a>" genus in Darwin Harbour, Australia, by Christopher Glasby, who works at the <a href="Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory">Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory</a>. The depth ranges from low tide level down to about . The worm was discovered in 2006 and <a href="Species%20description">first described</a> in 2012, being given the name "multicaudata" from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "multus" for "many", and "caudata" for "tailed".

Ecology.
"R. multicaudata" is a branching worm with its head hidden deep inside the sponge. The worm branches repeatedly, forming a tree-like structure. The side branches occupy the channels in the sponge, and their tips sometimes emerge into the open water, making the sponge appear to have white, hairy tentacles.

Researchers are puzzled as to how this worm obtains enough nourishment; the head may be eating the sponge tissues, but the worm is not thought to be able to move around inside the sponge and it is difficult to envisage how it could obtain enough nourishment through its mouth to sustain its much-branched body. The gut is continuous throughout the branches, but has been found to contain very few of the sponge's spicules. One possible solution to this dilemma is that the worm may be surviving on <a href="dissolved%20organic%20carbon">dissolved organic carbon</a> absorbed through its integument, as some other invertebrates, including polychaete worms, do.

Oxford Street bombing

On the 19 December 1974 the <a href="Provisional%20IRA">Provisional IRA</a> exploded a <a href="car%20bomb">car bomb</a> which was parked opposite to <a href="Selfridge%27s">Selfridge's</a> department store on <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a> in <a href="London">London</a>. The bomb attack was carried out by an IRA <a href="active%20service%20unit">active service unit</a> (ASU) known as the <a href="Provisional%20IRA%27s%20Balcombe%20Street%20Gang">Balcombe Street Gang</a> who carried out some 40 attacks in England between October 1974 - December 1975.

Background.
In August 1974 the Balcombe Street <a href="active%20service%20unit">ASU</a> had been sent over to England to await instructions on when to start military operations.
They opened their campaign with <a href="Guildford%20pub%20bombings">two devastating bombs in Guildford pubs</a> which killed four off-duty British soldiers, one civilian and injured over 60 people. 
In the run up to Christmas 1974 the unit carried out a string of attacks. On 11 December the unit carried out a bomb attack on the Long Bar of the <a href="Naval%20and%20Military%20Club">Naval and Military Club</a> in <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>, a few minutes later other members of the unit carried out a gun attack on the <a href="Cavalry%20Club">Cavalry Club</a>, nobody was injured in either attack. On 14 December the unit carried out a gun attack on the <a href="Churchill%20Hotel">Churchill Hotel</a> in <a href="Portman%20Square">Portman Square</a>, London, three people were injured. On the 17 December three time bombs exploded at telephone exchanges in London. In one of the explosions George Arthur (34), a post office telephonist, was killed, one other person was injured.

Bombing.
On Thursday the 19 December 1974 the IRA unit loaded a ligh blue <a href="Ford%20Cortina">Ford Cortina</a> with 100 lbs of <a href="gelignite">gelignite</a> explosive into the trunk of the car, the bomb was fitted with a pocket watch timing device and then primed. The IRA Volunteers drove the bomb car into Oxford Street and parked the stolen car at the side of Slefridge's building. 
At around 20:40 the leader of the IRA unit <a href="Joe%20O%27Connell%20%28Irish%20republican%29">Joe O'Connell</a> telephoned a warning to the <a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a> in London, giving security & emergency services about 15 – 20 minutes to clear the area.
At about 21:00 the bomb exploded. The blast was so loud it could be heard up to two miles away at St. Pauls Cathedral. The explosion shattered glass and blew in doors in shop fronts 100's of yards away from the site of the bombing in both directions of Oxford Street. O'Connell had used 160 sticks of gelginite to construct the bomb, this had been the largest bomb the IRA had exploded in England up until that point and the explosion was later estimated to have caused £1.5 million worth of damage. Despite the warnings nine people were injured in the blast and several people were treated for shock.

Aftermath.
A ceasefire between the IRA and the British forces in Northern Ireland was called in February 1975 and extended to mainland Britain. 
The ceasefire in Britain broke down in August 1975 when the IRA <a href="Caterham%20Arms%20pub%20bombing">bombed a pub in Caterham</a> injuring 33 people. This signaled the renewal of the bombing campaign in England, in September two people were killed and 65 injured in the <a href="London%20Hilton%20bombing">London Hilton bombing</a>, a month later one man was killed and over 20 injured in the <a href="Green%20Park%20Tube%20Station%20Bombing">Green Park Tube Station Bombing</a>, in November a combined total of three people were killed and 40 injured from the <a href="Scott%27s%20%28restaurant%29%20bombing">Scott's</a> and <a href="Walton%27s%20Restaurant%20bombing">Walton's Restaurant bombing</a>s.
The IRA unit was finally caught at the <a href="Balcombe%20Street%20Siege">Balcombe St siege</a> in December 1975, and the four man unit spent 23 years in prison before being released in 1998.

Even though the decision was only a first-instance "<a href="ex%20tempore">ex tempore</a>" decision, it has been repeatedly upheld, including by the <a href="Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> in 

Facts.
On 28 July 1953 the company, Nanwa Gold Mines, Ltd., devised a scheme whereby it would reduce its capital and issue one million new shares with a par value of one <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shilling</a> to generate fresh capital. Without such capital it would be unable to continue its business. Notices were sent to the shareholders advising them of the proposed scheme, and inviting them to subscribe for the new share issuance. In that notice it was stated:

The proposed share issuance was heavily under subscribed, and in September of 1953 the debenture holders <a href="receivership">appointed receivers</a>. The proposed scheme was formally abandoned by a resolution of the <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of directors</a> in January 1954. The debenture holders issued a summons for directions as to whether the subscription monies which were received formed part of the assets of the company or were held on trust for the persons who subscribed for shares.

Decision.
The case came before <a href="Charles%20Harman">Harman J</a>. He summed up the issue concisely:

The judge admitted this was a novel point, and that there seemed to be no authority directly in point. He also admitted, frankly, that "it occurred to [him] quite early in the argument that if the persons who sent their money on the faith of this document had no lien on the separate account there was something very wrong with the law on this subject."

He then discussed the paucity of authorities directly on point, and reviewed certain academic commentary which he pronounced to be unhelpful. He further reviewed section 51(3) of the <a href="Companies%20Act%201948">Companies Act 1948</a> which imposes an obligation on companies to maintain subscriber funds in a separate account (as the company had done here).

Then, without being explicit as to whether he was holding that the subscribers had a lien or the benefit of a trust, he held that they would be entitled to return of the subscription monies. The paragraphs which precede that determination refer only to the possibility of a trust and do not mention the word lien, and so the inference taken by subsequent authorities is that the ruling was in favour of a trust. But some academics prefer the view that the judgment held an equitable charge arose.

In the judgment Harman J noted the conceptual difficulties with holding that a trust existed, and these issues would also cause varying degrees of consternation in other cases involving "Quistclose" trusts. It is noteworthy that the case of "<a href="Toovey%20v%20Milne">Toovey v Milne</a>" (1819) 2 B&A 683, which was heavily relied upon by <a href="Richard%20Wilberforce%2C%20Baron%20Wilberforce">Lord Wilberforce</a> in "Quistclose" itself, was not cited in argument to Harman J.

Authority.
Despite being a short "ex tempore" first instance decision, "Re Nanwa Gold Mines" has never seriously been doubted. The case was commented upon briefly in "Barclays Bank v Quistclose Investments" where Lord Wilberforce said: "I do not think it necessary to examine these cases in detail, nor to comment on them, for I am satisfied that they do not affect the principle on which this appeal should be decided. They are merely examples which show that, in the absence of some special arrangement creating a trust (as was shown to exist in "Re Nanwa Gold Mines Ltd".), payments of this kind are made upon the basis that they are to be included in the company's assets."

The case was also cited with approval in "<a href="Swiss%20Bank%20Corporation%20v%20Lloyds%20Bank%20Limited">Swiss Bank Corporation v Lloyds Bank Limited</a>" [1982] AC 584, in "<a href="Re%20Kayford%20Ltd">Re Kayford Ltd</a>" [1975] 1 WLR 279 and in .

Islam Nusantara

Islam Nusantara or Indonesian (Islamic) model is a distinctive brand of <a href="Islam">Islam</a> developed in <a href="Nusantara">Nusantara</a> (<a href="Indonesian%20archipelago">Indonesian archipelago</a>) at least since the 16th century, as a result of interaction, contextualization, indigenization, interpretation and vernacularization of universal Islamic values, according to <a href="Indonesian%20culture">socio-cultural</a> reality of <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. The term was first officially coined, proposed and promoted by Indonesian Islamic organization <a href="Nahdlatul%20Ulama">Nahdlatul Ulama</a> in 2015, as an alternative for interpretation and representation of <a href="Muslim%20world">global Islam</a> that currently dominated by Arabic or Middle Eastern perspectives.

Islam Nusantara is defined as an interpretation of Islam that takes into account local Indonesian customs in forming its <a href="fiqh">fiqh</a>. On June 2015, Indonesian President <a href="Joko%20Widodo">Joko Widodo</a> has openly expressed his support for Islam Nusantara, which in his view is the moderate form of Islam compatible to Indonesian cultural values.

History.
The <a href="spread%20of%20Islam%20in%20Indonesia">spread of Islam in Indonesia</a> was a slow, gradual and relatively peaceful process. One theory suggests it arrived directly from <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a> before the 9th century, while another credits <a href="Sufism">Sufi</a> merchants and preachers for bringing Islam to Indonesian islands in the 12th or 13th century either from <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> in <a href="India">India</a> or directly from the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. By the 16th century, Islam began to supplant Hinduism and Buddhism as the major faith in the archipelago. The traditional Islam were mainly belongs to <a href="Ahlus-Sunnah%20wa%E2%80%99l-Jama%E2%80%99ah">Ahlus-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah</a> <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> branch, taught by revered clerics called "<a href="kyai">kyai</a>" in "<a href="pesantren">pesantren</a>" boarding school, especially in Java. Some aspects of traditional Islam in Indonesia has incorporated local culture and customs.

Early practice of Indonesian Islam were more or less influenced by Sufism and existing local Javanese spiritualism. Several traditions, such as revering and recognizing the authority of "kyai", honoring prominent Islamic figures such as <a href="Wali%20Songo">Wali Songo</a>, also took part in Islamic traditions such as "<a href="ziyarat">ziarah kubur</a>" (tomb pilgrimage), "<a href="tahlil">tahlil</a>an" ("<a href="selamatan">selamatan</a>" ceremony to sent the spirit of deceased one to the afterworld), and "<a href="Mawlid">maulid nabi</a>" (commemorating the prophet Muhammad's birthday) including Javanese "<a href="sekaten">sekaten</a>" ceremony, were observed diligently by traditionalist Muslims in Indonesia. However, after the incoming of <a href="Modernist%20Salafism">Modernist Salafism</a> followed by <a href="Wahhabism">Wahhabism</a> from Arabia, the scripturalist Islamic puritans denounced those traditions as "<a href="Shirk%20%28Islam%29">shirk</a>" or "<a href="bid%27ah">bid'ah</a>", deprecated as a form of <a href="syncretism">syncretism</a> that corrupted the purity of Islam. This condition has led to the ongoing religious dispute, uneasy coexistence and somewhat a spiritual rivalry, between traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama and modernist puritan <a href="Muhammadiyah">Muhammadiyah</a>.

As Indonesians watch cautiously on the destruction of the war-torned Middle East; the <a href="Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian%20conflict">Israeli–Palestinian conflict</a>, <a href="Arab%20Spring">Arab Spring</a>, the Iraq War and the <a href="Syrian%20War">Syrian War</a>, Indonesians noticed that some of this conflict were having religious aspect, especially the problem of <a href="radical%20Islam">radical Islam</a>. Indonesia also has suffered several <a href="Terrorism%20in%20Indonesia">terrorist attacks</a> that were launched by <a href="jihadist">jihadist</a> Islamist group such as <a href="Jamaah%20Islamiyah">Jamaah Islamiyah</a>'s <a href="Bali%20bombings">attacks on Bali</a>. The ultra conservative doctrine of <a href="Salafi">Salafi</a> and <a href="Wahhabi">Wahhabi</a> adhered and promoted by the state of <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> has been dominated the global discourse of Islam for decades. The wary sentiments were aggravated further by the advent of <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIS</a> in 2013 that performed abhorred war crimes in the name of Islam. Internally, some of foreign and local <a href="Islamist">Islamist</a> organizations, such as <a href="Hizbut%20Tahrir%20Indonesia">Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia</a> (HTI), <a href="Front%20Pembela%20Islam">Front Pembela Islam</a> (FPI) also Islamist political party such as <a href="Partai%20Keadilan%20Sejahtera">Partai Keadilan Sejahtera</a> (PKS) has been actively involved in Indonesian politics in recent years, undermining the traditionalist Islamic institution especially Nahdlatul Ulama. Those Islamist elements in Indonesian politics were suspiciously regarded as weakening and harming the state ideology <a href="Pancasila%20%28politics%29">Pancasila</a>.

As the result, there is a need among Indonesian moderate Muslim scholars to distinct, distance and differ themselves from the so-called <a href="Arabization">Arab Islam</a>, in contrast to <a href="Islam%20in%20Indonesia">Indonesian Islam</a>. Compared to their Middle East Muslims counterpart, Indonesian Muslims has enjoyed a relative peace and harmony for decades. It is believed that this was owed to Indonesians interpretation of Islam which is more moderate, inclusive and tolerant. Plus, there is a growing call from international community to urge Indonesia — as the world's largest Muslim population, to contribute to the evolution of Islamic world, by offering its brand of Islam as an alternative to Saudi's Wahhabism. Thus subsequently, Islam Nusantara was identified, formulated, coined and promoted.

Characteristics.
The main traits of Islam Nusantara are "tawasut" (moderate), "rahmah" (compassionate), anti-radical, inclusive and tolerant. Tawasut by "moderate" here connotes the Sunni Islamic theological position of <a href="Wasat%20%28Islamic%20term%29">wasatiyyah</a> rather than political position. In its relations to local culture, Islam Nusantara uses a sympathetic cultural approach on teaching Islam; it did not destroy, disrupt or supplant the native culture, but on the contrary embraces, honor, nurture and preserves local culture. One of the main characteristic of Islam Nusantara is the consideration of local Indonesian culture in forming their fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence).

Islam Nusantara was developed locally in indigenous educational institution of traditionalist "<a href="pesantren">pesantren</a>" boarding school. As the result, it based on traditional eastern decorum and mannerism; it emphasized in honoring the status and authority of "kyai" or "ulama" (religious teacher). The students requires the ongoing guidance of their religious teacher, in order not to went astray or developing false or radical ideas. Another distinctive aspect, is the emphasize on "Rahmatan lil Alamin" (blessings for the universe) as Islamic universal value, which promote peace, tolerance, mutual respects and a somewhat <a href="Pluralism">pluralist</a> outlook in regard of Islamic interactions within <a href="ummah">ummah</a> (within Muslim community) and in inter-religions relations.

Criticism.
Islam Nusantara has been fiercely opposed and criticized by other branch of Islam, especially by those who adheres <a href="wahhabism">wahhabism</a> and <a href="salafism">salafism</a>, or other similar doctrines that seeks to "purify" Islam from any "un-Islamic" local elements, which often condemned as "<a href="Shirk%20%28Islam%29">shirk</a>" or "<a href="Bid%E2%80%98ah">bid'ah</a>". Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, PKS and FPI has openly opposed the Islam Nusantara. Islam Nusantara has been criticized as a somewhat <a href="syncretic">syncretic</a> form of Islam, which undermine the "perfectness" and singularity of Islam and corrupted the unity of ummah.

<a href="Muhammadiyah">Muhammadiyah</a>, another influential Islamic organization in Indonesia — although not directly opposed to the concept, has stressed that the term Islam Nusantara should be addressed cautiously and proportionally, not to undermine and repress other branch of Islam, different understandings, or other doctrines of Islam. If Islam Nusantara is favoured, adopted, elevated and promoted by the state, they feared that other Islamic branches would suffer persecution and discrimination.

12th Anti-Aircraft Division (United Kingdom)

12th Anti-Aircraft Division (12 AA Division) was an air defence formation of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> during the early years of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It defended Western <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, including the period of the <a href="Clydebank%20Blitz">Clydebank Blitz</a> and <a href="Belfast%20Blitz">Belfast Blitz</a>, but only had a short career.

Mobilisation.
12 Anti-Aircraft Division was one of five new divisions created on 1 November 1940 by <a href="Anti-Aircraft%20Command">Anti-Aircraft Command</a> to control the expanding anti-aircraft (AA) defences of the United Kingdom. The division was formed by separating responsibility for Western Scotland (particularly the industrial areas of <a href="Clydeside">Clydeside</a> and <a href="Ayrshire">Ayrshire</a>) and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> from the existing <a href="3rd%20Anti-Aircraft%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3 AA Division</a>, which continued to be responsible for the rest of mainland Scotland.

The divisional headquarters (HQ) was at <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and the General Officer Commanding (GOC), appointed on 15 November 1940, was Major-General Gerald Rickards, promoted from command of <a href="44th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">44 AA Bde</a>. 12 AA Division formed part of <a href="3%20Anti-Aircraft%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3 AA Corps</a>.

The Blitz.
The division's fighting units, organised into three AA Brigades, consisted of Heavy (HAA) and Light (LAA) gun regiments and Searchlight (S/L) regiments of the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> (RA). The HAA guns were concentrated in the Gun Defence Areas (GDAs) at Belfast and Glasgow, LAA units were distributed to defend Vulnerable Points (VPs) such as factories and airfields, while the S/L detachments were disposed in clusters of three, spaced 10,400 yards apart.

The approved scale of HAA guns for the Clyde had been 80 in 1939, and this was raised to 120 in 1940 and again to 144 in March 1941, but by the end of February 1941, 12 AA Division still only had 67 guns in place, rising to 88 (11 batteries) in late March.

Glasgow and Clydeside received heavy raids on the nights of 13 and 14 March 1941 (the <a href="Clydebank%20Blitz">Clydebank Blitz</a>), and again on 7 April, while <a href="Belfast%20Blitz">Belfast</a> was hit on 15 April and 4 May. The "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" returned to Clydeside on 5 and 6 May, before <a href="The%20Blitz">The Blitz</a> petered out in mid-May.

Order of Battle 1940–41.
The division's composition during the Blitz was as follows:


Mid-War.
Newly formed AA units joined the division, the HAA and support units increasingly becoming 'Mixed' units, indicating that women of the <a href="Auxiliary%20Territorial%20Service">Auxiliary Territorial Service</a> (ATS) were fully integrated into them. At the same time, experienced units were posted away to train for service overseas; in some cases they joined 12 AA Division temporarily while they trained in Scotland; others remained with AA Command as unbrigaded units. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (<a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>) and the need to transfer AA units to counter the <a href="Baedeker%20Blitz">Baedeker raids</a>.

At the end of 1941 S/Ls were declustered to form 'killer zones' for night fighters, and the S/L requirement for Northern Ireland was reduced to three batteries. As a result, 91st S/L Rgt could be converted into an LAA Rgt for the field army.

In May 1942, <a href="57th%20Light%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">57th AA Bde HQ</a> was transferred to 12 AA Division from <a href="7th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7 AA Division</a>; some units from 42 AA Bde were transferred to it, together with newly formed units. In August, to deal with the "Luftwaffe" 's hit-and-run attacks, 3 AA Division HQ was moved from Scotland to the South Coast of England and 12 AA Division took over command of <a href="51st%20Light%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">51 AA Bde</a> and its units.

Order of Battle 1941–42.
During this period the division was composed as follows (temporary attachments omitted):


The increased sophistication of Operations Rooms and communications was reflected in the growth in support units, which attained the following organisation by May 1942:

The RAOC companies became part of the new <a href="Royal%20Electrical%20and%20Mechanical%20Engineers">Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers</a> (REME) during 1942.

Disbandment.
A reorganisation of AA Command in October 1942 saw the AA divisions disbanded and replaced by a smaller number of AA Groups more closely aligned with the groups of <a href="RAF%20Fighter%20Command">RAF Fighter Command</a>. 12 AA Division amalgamated with 3 and 7 AA Divisions to form <a href="6th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Group%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">6 AA Group</a>, based at <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and cooperating with <a href="No.%2014%20Group%20RAF">No. 14 Group RAF</a>, while Northern Ireland became <a href="7th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Group%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7 AA Group</a> based at <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> and working with <a href="No.%209%20Group%20RAF">No. 9 Group RAF</a>. Major-General Rickards retired. 12 AA Divisional Signals was amalgamated back into its parent 3 AA Divisional Signals as 6 AA Group (Mixed) Signals.

General Officer Commanding.
The following officer commanded 12th AA Division:

Colorado de Pococí, Costa Rica

Colorado is the 6th district of the <a href="Pococ%C3%AD%20%28canton%29">Canton of Pococí</a>, in the province of Limón, Costa Rica. It measures 1,165.37 km², which corresponds to about 48% of the cantonal area. However, its estimated population is only 3,985 hbaitnates (2011), so it has one of the lowest demographic densities at the national level (3.42 hab / km²).

The district includes the town of Barra del Colorado, the district of Barra del Colorado East, as well as the towns of Aragon, Buenavista, Malanga, Puerto Lindo, San Gerardo, Tortuguero and Verdades.

A 78 km-long river channel connects the southern boundary of Barra del Colorado with the Port of Moin along the Caribbean Sea coast. The communication with the zone is essentially fluvial or aerial (Airport of Barra del Colorado), due to the little development of the terrestrial routes.

Geography.
Colorado basically consists of protected wilderness areas, in particular the National Wildlife Refuge Barra del Colorado and the Tortuguero National Park.

Its main population is Barra del Colorado, located at an altitude of 5 msnm, on the banks of the Colorado River, an important tributary of the border river <a href="San%20Juan%20River">Nicaragua</a> , Which delimits by the south to the island Calero (with 151.6 km ² is the greater of the country). Another important and near fluvial island is the Brava Island (of 44,4 km ²).

The territory of the district is a continuation of the alluvial plains of the north of the country. With small elevations isolated like the hills Coronel, Cocorí and Tortuguero (of 119 msnm).

Climate.
The climate is regularly very humid and hot, without a defined dry season, thanks to the contribution of the trade winds.

Rain is abundant throughout the year, but there is a noticeable decrease in rainfall during the month of March.

The average annual temperature ranges from 26 to 28 degrees Celsius.

Hydrography.
An intense and permanent pluvial activity precipitates of 5,500 to 6,000 mm of water per year, flooding the plain, already already saturated by the waters of the rivers San Juan, Colorado and Chirripó in its northern limit. To the south, the main rivers are the Suerre, Jiménez and Parismina, which feed the artificial channel of Tortuguero.

The water covers much of the district, in the form of rivers, pipes, canals, lagoons or marshes.

Rest in Power: The Enduring Life of Trayvon Martin

Rest in Power: The Enduring Life of Trayvon Martin is a non-fiction book written Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, the parents of <a href="Trayvon%20Martin">Trayvon Martin</a>, a young man thrust into the media spotlight after his death by fatal shooting drew nation-wide protests against racial violence.

Summary.
"Rest in Power" was written nearly five years after the events of the book took place. Fulton describes the book as intended as both as means to heal and share with the world the <a href="Trayvon%20Martin">Trayvon Martin</a> his parents knew and loved, as well as the impact the events had on their life.

The book is introduced by Sybrina Fulton, Travyon's mother, who states "no one gets over the death of a child." She describes how prior to the incident, she felt she was just another "anonymous" American who goes through life in a predictable rhythm of work, school, church and picnics. But after the death of Travyon, she became an activist working to prevent other senseless gun violence. But this activism "failed to prevent the death of <a href="Shooting%20of%20Jordan%20Davis">Jordan Davis</a> (<a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>), <a href="Shooting%20of%20Michael%20Brown">Michael Brown</a> (<a href="Ferguson%2C%20Missouri">Ferguson</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>), <a href="Shooting%20of%20Tamir%20Rice">Tamir Rice</a> (<a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>), <a href="Death%20of%20Eric%20Garner">Eric Garner</a> (<a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>) as well as countless others". 

Fulton goes on to discuss her son Trayvon and how before he became a "<a href="martyr">martyr</a>" and "<a href="Racial%20injustice">symbol of racial injustice</a>", he was simply a boy growing up trying to find his way in life. She reflects on her own life growing up, meeting and marrying Tracy Martin, and raising Trayvon together.

The rest of book alternates between Fulton and Tracy Martin as they discuss being forced out of their lives as ordinary Americans and into the spotlight because of death of their son and the events that followed.

Publisher.
The book was published by <a href="Spiegel%20%26amp%3B%20Grau">Spiegel & Grau</a>, an imprint of <a href="Penguin%20Random%20House">Penguin Random House</a>, on 31 January 2017.

Reception.
"Rest in Power" was widely and favorably reviewed. In "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" it received three and a half of four stars; in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", <a href="Wesley%20Lowery">Wesley Lowery</a> called it "a beautiful, searing account of their experience...an intimate portrait of their slain son and a detail-rich chronicle of the year from his death to his killer’s acquittal."

Re Curtain Dream plc

Re Curtain Dream plc [1990] BCLC 925 is a judicial decision of the English courts in relation to <a href="recharacterisation">recharacterisation</a>. It held that where a transaction was documented in a certain way to mask the true nature of the transaction, the court could disregard the mask and construe the transaction as it was intended to be in truth. The court held that properly construed the transaction in question was a <a href="mortgage">mortgage</a> which was <a href="void%20%28law%29">void</a> against a <a href="Liquidator%20%28law%29">liquidator</a> for non-registration.

Facts.
Curtain Dream plc was a fabric company. It was indebted to <a href="Barclays%20Bank">Barclays Bank</a> who had taken security over all of the company's assets. Subsequently, the company entered into a financing arrangement with Churchill Merchanting Ltd. Under that arrangement the company would sell all of its stock in trade to Churchill. Churchill would then sell that stock back to the company on <a href="Title%20retention%20clause">retention of title terms</a>, such that the stock remained the property of Churchill until the company sold it to a third party. The company would then use the proceeds of sale to pay Churchill the original purchase price plus accrued interest. The fabric itself remained at all times in the company's warehouse and never moved.

The company failed and Barclays appointed <a href="receivership">receivers</a>. The receivers then brought an application challenging the financing arrangements with Churchill, alleging that in reality it amounted to a mortgage, and that the mortgage was not enforceable because it had not been registered as required by section 395 of the <a href="Companies%20Act%201985">Companies Act 1985</a>.

Decision.
The case came before <a href="John%20Leonard%20Knox">Knox J</a>.

He reviewed the relevant authorities on financing transactions and mortgages, including the judgment of <a href="Ernest%20Pollock%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hanworth">Lord Hanworth MR</a> in "Re George Inglefield Ltd" [1933] Ch 1, particularly his comment that: "It is old law, and plain law, that in transactions of this sort the Court must consider whether or not the documents really mask the true transaction. If they do merely mask the transaction, the Court must have regard to the true position, in substance and in fact, and for this purpose tear away the mask or cloak that has been put upon the real transaction." He also reviewed "Manchester Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Co v North Central Wagon Co" (1888) 13 App Cas 554.

Ultimately he decided that in truth the transaction was a financing arrangement. Churchill were not traders in fabric and had never taken possession of it. The terms of the agreements made it clear that funds were being advanced on credit and were subject to interest at commercial rates. The transfer and re-transfer of title to the fabric was, in truth, a mortgage and was unenforceable for non-registration.

Appeal.
An appeal was lodged against the decision, but was abandoned before trial.

Vadya

Vadya (<a href="IAST">IAST</a>: Vādya, वाद्य), also called "Vadyaka" or "Atodya", is one of the three components of "<a href="sangita">sangita</a>" (musical performance arts), and refers to "instrumental music" in the Indian traditions. The other two components of "sangita" are "gita" (vocal music, song) and "nrtya" (dance, movement). In the general sense, "Vadya" means an instrument and the characteristic music they produce, sound or play out.

The term "Vadya" in the sense of "music, sounded, played, uttered" appears in the Vedic literature such as in the "Aitareya Brahmana", and in early post-Vedic era Sanskrit texts such as the "<a href="Natya%20Shastra">Natya Shastra</a>", "<a href="Panchatantra">Panchatantra</a>", "Malvikagnimitra" and "Kathasaritsagara". These texts call the musician or the performer on the musical instrument as "Vadyadhara". A stringed instrument is described with proportional lengths in "Jaiminiya Brahmana" and "Aitareya Aranyaka", and these are compared to poetical meters.

The Sanskrit literature such as "Natya Shastra" describes four types of "Vadya":

The chapter 14 of the "Saṅgītaśiromaṇi" describes musical ensembles based on a collective performance of "vadya" instruments by musicians, and it calls such a band orchestra as a "Kutapa". The term "Vadya" also appears in the Buddhist Sanskrit text "<a href="Longer%20Sukh%C4%81vat%C4%ABvy%C5%ABha%20S%C5%ABtra">Sukhavativyuha</a>", influential in the Chinese and Japanese traditions, which Luis Gomez translates as "instrumental music". The 17th-century text "Sangeeta Darpana" defines "sangita" (musical arts) as "Gītam Vādyam Tathā Nrityam Trayan Sangeeta Muchyate", which states Dona means, "sangita" comprises "gīta" (vocal music), "vādya" (instrumental music) and "nritya" (dance).

248th (Welwyn) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery

248th (Welwyn) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery, (248 HAA Bty) was an air defence unit of Britain's <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> (TA). Formed just before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, it fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a> and the <a href="Swansea%20Blitz">Swansea Blitz</a>, and later defended <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="British%20Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. It continued serving in the post-war TA until 1955.

Origin.
During the period of international tension in 1938, the TA was rapidly expanded, particularly for the Anti-Aircraft (AA) role. Much of this expansion was achieved by converting and/or expanding existing units. 343 (Watford) Field Battery was separated from <a href="Hertfordshire%20Yeomanry">86th (East Anglian) (Herts Yeomanry) Field Brigade, Royal Artillery</a> (partly descended from the old <a href="Hertfordshire%20Yeomanry">Hertfordshire Yeomanry</a> cavalry) and converted into a complete new AA regiment, <a href="79th%20%28Hertfordshire%20Yeomanry%29%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) AA Regiment, Royal Artillery</a>. Regimental headquarters (RHQ) and two of the batteries (246 (1st Watford) and 247 (2nd Watford)) remained at <a href="Watford">Watford</a>, while the third (248) was newly raised at <a href="Welwyn%20Garden%20City">Welwyn Garden City</a>.
The Hertfordshire Territorial Association obtained a site from the Welwyn Garden City Estate Office at Lemsford Lane where a drill hall could be built and recruitment for the new battery began on 14 November 1938. Supported by the local newspaper, public meetings and letters to local employers, recruitment went well and by March 1939 was close to the establishment of 172. <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">Captain</a> F.D.E. Fremantle of the 86th Field Regiment was appointed officer commanding (OC) of 248 Bty with the rank of <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major</a>. Training had to be carried out on two <a href="QF%203.7-inch%20AA%20gun">QF 3.7-inch AA gun</a>s borrowed from a London AA battery.

Mobilisation.
In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of <a href="Anti-Aircraft%20Command">Anti-Aircraft Command</a> was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each TA AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected gun positions. 79th (HY) AA Regiment was embodied on 25 June for a partial deployment to gunsites along the south bank of the <a href="Thames%20Estuary">Thames Estuary</a>, with 248 Bty at Brookley Park, <a href="Lewisham">Lewisham</a>. The availability of equipment at the gunsites was invaluable for training the recruits, and the second half of the month's embodiment was spent at the AA Practice Camp at <a href="Bude">Bude</a> in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, where 248 Battery scored a direct hit on a <a href="De%20Havilland%20Queen%20Bee">Queen Bee</a> radio-controlled target aircraft.

On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised and sent to its war stations, which in the case of 79th (HY) AA Rgt were to defend airfields of <a href="No.%2011%20Group%20RAF">11 Group</a> of <a href="RAF%20Fighter%20Command">RAF Fighter Command</a>. One section of 248 Bty manned two <a href="QF%203-inch%2020%20cwt">3-inch guns</a> at <a href="RAF%20Biggin%20Hill">RAF Biggin Hill</a> while the rest of the battery manned <a href="Lewis%20gun">Lewis</a> <a href="Light%20machine%20gun">Light machine gun</a>s (LMGs) at <a href="RAF%20Felixstowe">RAF Felixstowe</a> (8 LMGs) and <a href="RAF%20Martlesham%20Heath">RAF Martlesham Heath</a> (12 LMGs).

World War II.
Phoney War.
After war was declared on 3 September there were numerous adjustments to AA Command's deployment as further units and equipment became available. During the autumn 79th (HY) AA Rgt handed over most of its responsibilities for airfields, and shifted towards the Gun Defence Area (GDA) round the port of <a href="Harwich">Harwich</a> and adjacent harbours. 248 Battery was deployed as follows:

On 17 October the battery fired the regiment's first rounds in anger, when sites H2 and H3 engaged an aircraft identified as hostile. The War Establishment of the battery was now 290 all ranks, and on 21 October a draft of 132 recruits (<a href="Militia%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%23The%20Militiamen">Militiamen</a> with 3 months' AA training) arrived, after which the 125 men who were aged under 19 or over 38, or who were unfit for overseas service, were posted away in early November.

On 26 December a warning order was received to prepare to move overseas, and the detachments concentrated at Harwich. The regiment was designated as a base defence AA regiment to man static 3.7-inch guns. 248 Battery was already experienced with the 3.7-inch and only needed to attend short courses by sections on a static gun site at <a href="Dartford%2C%20Kent">Dartford, Kent</a> before mobilising at <a href="Princess%20Royal%20Barracks%2C%20Deepcut">Blackdown Camp</a> near <a href="Aldershot%20Garrison">Aldershot</a>. Here it was issued with vehicles (many of them <a href="Impressment">impressed</a> civilian lorries) and joined by a draft of 62 Militia reinforcements from <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> to bring it up to full establishment.

France.
248 Battery proceeded from Blackdown to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> and sailed for France on the night of 7/8 February 1940. It landed at <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> where it came under the operational command of <a href="8th%20%20%28Belfast%29%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">8th (Belfast) AA Rgt</a> in <a href="3rd%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3 AA Bde</a> guarding the lines of communication for the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF). It was to remain at Le Havre to man two static 3.7-inch gun positions at Parc de la Hève on the edge of the cliff in front of the lighthouse. The concrete pits were built and guns emplaced by 27 February and a <a href="GL%20Mk.%20I%20radar">Gun-Laying (GL) Radar Mk I</a> was set up. While this was being done, Nos 2 and 3 Sections manned the guns at <a href="Octeville-sur-Mer">Octeville Airfield</a>. The rest of the regiment disembarked on 6 March and deployed around the port and airfield. 79th (HY) AA Regiment devised an AA barrage scheme using fixed bearings and staggered heights over the docks and oil storage tanks for 'unseen' fire at night; this was codenamed 'Pillar of Fire'.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a> began on 10 May with the German invasion of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Low Countries</a> and France. The BEF followed the pre-arranged <a href="Battle%20of%20France%23Dyle%20Plan.2FPlan%20D">Plan D</a> and advanced into Belgium, but a rapid German breakthrough in the <a href="Ardennes">Ardennes</a> forced it to fall back again. By 21 May the main body of the BEF was cut off, and between 26 May and 4 June as much as possible was evacuated through Dunkirk (<a href="Operation%20Dynamo">Operation Dynamo</a>).

From 10 to 19 May the only "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" activity in the Le Havre area had been daily reconnaissance flights, but on the night of 19/20 May there was a three-hour raid on the French airfield at Octeville, during which 'Pillar of fire' brought down an enemy aircraft, followed on succeeding nights by attempts to drop <a href="Parachute%20mine">Parachute mine</a>s into the harbour entrance. Even after the Dunkirk evacuation ended, there were still British forces in France north of the <a href="Seine">Seine</a>, and 79th (HY) HAA Rgt maintained its defences at Le Havre covering the Seine ferries. Nightly air attacks on the harbour area began in earnest on 3/4 June, with the guns in action for long periods.

By 8 June, under renewed German attacks, <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Armoured Division</a>, <a href="51st%20%28Highland%29%20Division">51st (Highland) Division</a> and assorted other British forces were withdrawing to the Seine. That night, with much of the town and oil depots set on fire by the raids, 'Cuckoo Section' of 79th (HY) AA Rgt ferried the highly secret GL radar transmitter trailers and their receiver trailers across the river to Honfleur, followed by the mobile guns. With the enemy closing on Le Havre (51st (H) Division was cut off and forced to surrender), 3 AA Bde was ordered to evacuate. On the night of 11/12 June RHQ and most of 248 Bty boarded SS "St Briac", which took them to <a href="Cherbourg-Octeville">Cherbourg</a>, while a party of 248 Bty destroyed the remaining static guns.

<a href="Operation%20Ariel">Operation Ariel</a>, to evacuate the remainder of the British forces from France, was now under way. From Cherbourg, RHQ and the batteries without equipment were shunted by train between <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a> and <a href="Rennes">Rennes</a> before being evacuated from <a href="St%20Nazaire">St Nazaire</a> aboard SS "<a href="SS%20Duchess%20of%20York%20%281928%29">Duchess of York</a>" and reaching <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on 18 June. The party of 248 Bty that had stayed to disable the guns was evacuated through <a href="St%20Malo">St Malo</a>.

Home Defence.
The bulk of 79th (HY) Heavy AA Rgt (as AA units were designated from June 1940 to distinguish them from Light AA) was accommodated in guest houses in <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> before attending No 1 AA Practice Camp at <a href="Aberporth">Aberporth</a> in West Wales. It was then ordered to join <a href="45th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">45 AA Bde</a> in <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a> as part of <a href="5th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">5 AA Division</a>. The regiment relieved batteries of <a href="77th%20%28Welsh%29%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">77th (Welsh) HAA Rgt</a> at <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> to allow them to attend Aberporth in turn. Two sections of 248 Bty spent over a month at Cardiff, with the guns in action against almost daily air raids during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>.

By early September, the regiment was concentrated round the <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a> GDA, where RHQ and 248 Bty set up a Gun Operations Room (GOR) in two <a href="Requisitioned">Requisitioned</a> houses and arranged a barrage scheme codenamed 'Ball of Fire'. Two sections of 248 Bty occupied V site near <a href="Neath">Neath</a> with the 3-inch guns brought from Cardiff, but these guns did not have the range to cover Swansea, so the battery exchanged with 246 Bty at T site at <a href="Sketty">Sketty</a>. These guns were replaced with 3-7-inch at the end of December. During October, 248 Bty began constructing a new gunsite (S) at <a href="Mumbles%20%28district%29">Mumbles</a>, which broke away from convention by positioning the emplacements at the corners of a field, concealed in the hedges and served by the existing road, rather than grouped in the centre of the field with visible access tracks. The position was completed and guns mounted in December. The new elevation-finding (E/F or 'Effie') attachment for the GL Mk I radar was also installed.

During the winter, 79th (HY) HAA Rgt provided <a href="Cadre%20%28military%29">cadres</a> for new batteries forming at the training regiments. It also took in a draft of local Welsh recruits for basic training, some of whom stayed with the regiment afterwards, and then trained an intake of older men for <a href="Z%20Battery">'Z' Battery Rocket units</a>.

Swansea Blitz.
There was enemy air activity over the <a href="Bristol%20Channel">Bristol Channel</a> and South Wales coast on most nights, but usually these were reconnaissances or nuisance raids. Heavier raids against Swansea began on 4/5 January 1941, when a bomb put all the GOR telephone lines out of action, but 248 Bty at S and T sites was able to continue with 'Ball of Fire' barrages controlled by T site's GL radar with Effie providing angles of sight. 248 Battery's S and T sites were heavily engaged again on 17/18 January as the German aircraft bombed systematically across the town. One aircraft was destroyed that night.

By the beginning of February 1941 the HAA guns in the Swansea GDA still only numbered 18 out of a planned establishment of 36. The battery was responsible for the following renamed sites:

In February 1941 the "Luftwaffe" began a new tactic of hitting the same towns on successive nights in an attempt to put them completely out of action. Swansea was the first town so attacked. On the night of 19/20 February the building housing RHQ and the GOR was destroyed by a direct hit during a heavy raid, but the guns continued firing under local control and communications were maintained, once again through N6 site. A temporary GOR was established at 248 Bty HQ.
The "Luftwaffe" returned to continue the '<a href="Swansea%20Blitz">Swansea Blitz</a>' on the nights of 20/21 and 21/22 February. On the latter night there was confusion between the Sector Operations Room at <a href="RAF%20Pembrey">RAF Pembrey</a> and the temporary GOR, resulting in the guns ceasing fire between 20.20 and 21.10, leaving the town centre unprotected. Although some raiders were shot down once the restriction was lifted, the centre of Swansea was devastated, and fires and delayed-action bombs destroyed communications. The GOR had to be temporarily relocated again to Neath.

The number of HAA guns in the Swansea GDA was increased when two batteries of the newly formed <a href="120th%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">120th HAA Rgt</a> came under the operational command of 79th (HY) HAA Rgt, and 248 Bty was brought up to its full establishment of eight guns. However, activity was now limited to firing at aircraft overflying the area on the way to bomb <a href="Liverpool%20Blitz">Merseyside</a> (12/13 March), <a href="Clydebank%20Blitz">Clydeside</a> (13/14 March) and <a href="Bristol%20Blitz">Bristol</a> (16/17 March). Engagements were sporadic thereafter as the Blitz ended in May.

London.
In mid-August 1941, 248 Battery was transferred from 79th (HY) HAA Rgt to bolster the inexperienced 120th HAA Rgt, which was transferring to <a href="26th%20%28London%29%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade">26 (London) AA Bde</a>. Between 18 and 20 August it handed over its responsibilities to a newly arrived battery and on 21 August it took over two static four-gun 3.7-inch sites in North London:
Routine moves over the coming months saw the battery occupying the following sites at various times:


120th HAA Regiment and 248 Bty remained in and around London for over a year, serving through the desultory "Luftwaffe" raids of 1942.

Major Fremantle was promoted to Temporary <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> to command <a href="140th%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">140th HAA Rgt</a> in February 1942, and was replaced as OC 248 (Welwyn) Bty by Major G.A. Reid. Lt-Col Fremantle was later awarded the <a href="Territorial%20Decoration">Territorial Decoration</a> and at the end of the war he was on the financial staff of <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force">Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force</a> in North West Europe.

Cyprus.
In mid-January 1943, 120th HAA Rgt left 26 AA Bde and came under <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> control to mobilise as a defended ports unit. After two months at the mobilisation centre at <a href="Easthampstead">Easthampstead</a> in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> it sailed from Liverpool on 14 March and disembarked at <a href="Port%20Tewfik">Port Tewfik</a> in <a href="Egypt%23British%20protectorate%20.281882.E2.80.931952.29">Egypt</a> on 6 May. Here it came under <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Forces</a>. After a month in Egypt it was moved by railway to <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> and then by sea to <a href="British%20Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, where it landed on 14 June to take over AA defence of ports and airfields on the island under <a href="20th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%29United%20Kingdom%29">20 AA Bde</a> in <a href="Ninth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ninth Army</a>.

248 Battery was initially deployed as follows:

Major M.J. Pickering took over command from Major Reid at the end of June 1943, when the unit was changed to a semi-mobile establishment. In early July, A Trp moved to <a href="Famagusta">Famagusta</a> and then to <a href="Limassol">Limassol</a> in mid-August, while B Trp moved to <a href="Paphos">Paphos</a> in mid-August. In addition, detachments from the battery manned guns on the island of <a href="Kastellorizo">Castelrosso</a>, at that time the only island of the <a href="Dodecanese%20campaign">Dodecanese</a> in <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> hands.

At the end of October 1943, 248 Bty was 'diluted' (as the process was officially described) by a draft of 80 <a href="Basuto">Basuto</a> troops from the African Pioneer Corps to be trained as gunners, releasing a similar number of British Other Ranks for duties elsewhere. The state of readiness in Cyprus was relaxed in March 1944 and the AA defences on the island were run down during April. The remaining personnel moved to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> where 120th HAA Rgt, including 248 (Welwyn) Bty, was disbanded in May–June 1944.

Postwar.
When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 79th (HY) HAA Rgt was reformed as 479 (Mobile) (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Regiment, with batteries at <a href="Chipping%20Barnet">Barnet</a>, Watford and Welwyn Garden City. Recruitment opened on 31 May 1947. As a designated mobile unit it was equipped with towed 3.7-inch guns and radar.

AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 and the number of AA units in the TA was drastically reduced. 479 (HY) HAA Regiment amalgamated back into its former parent regiment, now 286 (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Medium Rgt based at <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>. One of the combined batteries was formed at Welwyn Garden City.

Heslop was educated at <a href="Norwich%20School">Norwich School</a> and at <a href="Clare%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Clare College, Cambridge</a>. A batsman often used as an opener and an occasional bowler, he was picked for <a href="Minor%20Counties">Minor Counties</a> matches for <a href="Norfolk%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Norfolk</a> from the age of 17 in the <a href="Minor%20Counties%20Championship">Minor Counties Championship</a>'s inaugural season of 1895, and played for the county through to 1901.

Menemen Gediz Bridge

The Menemen Gediz Bridge (), also known as the Old Gediz Bridge (), officially named the Governor Kâzım Dirik Bridge () and historically called the Buruncuk Bridge (), is a long <a href="Tied-arch%20bridge">bowstring-arch bridge</a> that crosses the <a href="Gediz%20River">Gediz River</a> near <a href="Menemen">Menemen</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. Completed in 1935, the bridge was one of the first five <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced concrete</a> bridges built by the Republic of Turkey.

On 27 November 2014, the bridge was given heritage status by the Turkish Culture and Tourism Board.

History.
The coastal route north from <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a> (modern-day <a href="Izmir">Izmir</a>) to <a href="Bergama">Bergama</a> was an important trading route for centuries. The main natural obstacle along the route was the Gediz river, running through the mostly flat "Gediz Plain" just north of <a href="Menemen">Menemen</a>. Despite the importance of the route, no bridge had been constructed across the river, forcing travelers to wade through the water. This proved to be a difficult task for caravans and horse-drawn carriages. 

An alternate route opened in 1890, when the <a href="Smyrna%20Cassaba%20Railway">Smyrna Cassaba Railway</a> built a railway to <a href="Soma%2C%20Manisa">Soma</a> ( east of Bergama), from its main line at <a href="Manisa">Manisa</a>. This allowed for a faster route to Smyrna, despite traveling further inland. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, a wooden bridge was constructed over the Gediz near <a href="Buruncuk">Buruncuk</a> to allow for quicker troop movement in the region. After the war, the bridge continued to exit along the route, but was in need of constant repair.

Plans to build a new bridge across the river were put forth by the Turkish government in 1932. The concession was first awarded to a Turkish contractor, Hayri Kayadelen, at a cost of 163,144 <a href="Turkish%20lira">Turkish lira</a>s. Shortly after, the concession was transferred to another Turkish company under Mehmet Galip and Fescizade İbrahim. The contract was finalized and construction began on 21 February 1932, under the supervision of Turkish, Bulgarian and Hungarian engineers. During construction of the new bridge, the existing wooden bridge was still utilized by the workers and the public. The structure was completed on 27 February 1935 consisting of five reinforced concrete bowstring-arches. A few days later, on 8 March, a heavy storm caused severe flooding from the river. This flooding destroyed a large portion of the wooden bridge and forced repairs on the new bridge. The accident forced Izmir governor <a href="K%C3%A2z%C4%B1m%20Dirik">Kâzım Dirik</a> to personally apologize to villagers and residents in the area and oversee the repair process.

After repairs were finished and the road completed, the bridge was inaugurated with an official ceremony on 31 July 1935. Minister of Transport <a href="Ali%20%C3%87etinkaya">Ali Çetinkaya</a> and Kâzım Dirik, along with local mayors and the engineers and workers all attended the ceremony. The bridge was named "Governor Kâzım Dirik Bridge" by the Turkish Ministry of Public Works for Dirik's efforts overseeing repairs after the flooding.

In 1950, with the formation of the <a href="Turkish%20State%20Highway%20System">Turkish State Highway System</a>, the route was designated part of the <a href="State%20road%20D.550%20%28Turkey%29">D.550</a> state highway until the 1990s when the highway was expanded to four lanes, and a new bridge over the Gediz was constructed just northwest.

Lake Springfield (Missouri)

Lake Springfield is a 318-acre artificial cooling lake located in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Missouri">Springfield, Missouri</a> created for the Jame River Power Plant. It was built by placing a dam on the <a href="James%20River%20%28Missouri%29">James River</a>. It now serves as a popular fishing and recreation area.

History.
Lake Springfield was created in 1957 with the construction of a dam on the <a href="James%20River%20%28Missouri%29">James River</a>. The city of Springfield purchased the land before it was submerged. It cost $11.1 million to buy the land and build the dam to create the lake and first two units of the power station. The lake was to be a cooling reservoir for the James River Power plant. Construction on the first two units of the power plant was started in 1957. Three more units were added to the power plant by 1970. 

Water from the lake was used to cool the steam generators. The city used the creation of the lake to create a large recreational area because the area was in close proximity to the city and the area had been previously been used by the public for 75 years.

The generators were originally constructed to burn <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> but the federal <a href="Fuel%20Use%20Act%20of%201978">Fuel Use Act of 1978</a> forced it to switch to coal.

In the 1990's the Missouri Department of Conservation partnered with City Utilities of Springfield to create a a boat ramp, fishing dock, and several fishing platforms and lake accesses.

The generator units had a life expectancy of 30 years. In 2015, the power plant was slated to be shut down. The original three generators have already been discontinued.

Recreation.
The lake contains <a href="largemouth%20bass">largemouth bass</a>, <a href="white%20crappie">white crappie</a>, <a href="bluegill">bluegill</a>, <a href="redear%20sunfish">redear sunfish</a>, and <a href="channel%20catfish">channel catfish</a>. It is a popular fishing destination for residents of Springfield. Springfield City Utilities limits the size of motor boats to 6-HP because the lake is shallow and large boats would stir up silt. There is a water front park, marina and fishing jetties.

It competed from 2013 to 2015 and was replaced in 2016 by the <a href="BMW%20M6%23F12/13%20M6%20%282012%E2%80%93present%29">M6</a> GTLM.

Development.
In late 2012, <a href="BMW%20Motorsport">BMW Motorsport</a> set out to replace the successful M3 GT/GT2, a car which brought BMW two team and manufacturers' championships (2010 & 2011), one drivers championship (2011), back to back Sebring 12 Hour GT class wins in 2011 and 2012 in the <a href="American%20Le%20Mans%20Series">American Le Mans Series</a>, as well as numerous victories in the then <a href="Intercontinental%20Le%20Mans%20Cup">Intercontinental Le Mans Cup</a> (now the <a href="FIA%20World%20Endurance%20Championship">World Endurance Championship</a>) in Europe. BMW turned to the successful Z4 GT3 platform to develop a <a href="LM%20GTE">LM GTE</a> specification race car for the ALMS, and any GTE class series. 

Technical.
The Z4 GTE uses the Z4 body, and same 4.4 litre V8 engine as the GT3 car. The drivetrain and gearbox are much the same in the two different types of Z4. The engine in the GT3 version produces around 500 horsepower, likewise in the GTE version, but the RPM limits are 9000, and 7500, respectively. Most of the differences between the two automobiles are in aerodynamics. The GT3 car has much more sophisticated aero, with a set of winglets on the front fenders to provide additional downforce. Both cars share a front splitter, while the GTE has slight modifications on the side edges to condition the airflow around the front wheels. The GT3 version also has a double deck rear wing, with the GTE car having a single deck wing. The rear diffuser is also less aggressive in the GTE car; it also has much wider bodywork in the rear of the car, with heavily modified aero around the wheel arches, front, and specifically rear, compared to the GT3.

American Le Mans Series.
The car was debuted at the <a href="2013%2012%20Hours%20of%20Sebring">2013 12 Hours of Sebring</a> by BMW Team <a href="Rahal%20Letterman%20Lanigan%20Racing">Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing</a> running competitively despite being a new car. Leading the GTE class at times, both Z4 GTE's encountered suspension problems with three hours to go, and went 3-5 laps down from the class leaders. The cars also showed exceptional handling, but a slight lack in straight line speed as a result. The 2013 Long Beach Grand Prix proved to be the first win for the car, with the #55 Z4 GTE driven by <a href="Bill%20Auberlen">Bill Auberlen</a> and <a href="Maxime%20Martin">Maxime Martin</a> driving a fine race, bringing home a 1-2 finish for <a href="BMW">BMW</a>.

Tudor United SportsCar Championship.
The Z4 GTE will feature in the GTLM class of the Tudor <a href="United%20SportsCar%20Championship">United SportsCar Championship</a> - a merger of the ALMS and Grand-Am, debuting at the 2014 Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona in January.

<a href="Turner%20Motorsport">Turner Motorsport</a> won the inaugural 2014 Tudor United SportsCar GT-Daytona Championship with an altered version of the Z4 GT3. Drivers Dane Cameron and Markus Palttala won four races (Laguna Seca, Watkins Glen 6-Hour, Road America, and Virginia) with Cameron earning the pole position for the 12 Hours of Sebring. To compete in the GTD class, the Turner Z4 lost its GT3-spec aerodynamics, ABS, and traction control systems.

Another member of this house, Fernando de Piña, captain of the personal guards of James I, Fernando took part in the conquest the balears islands and in that of <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>. Fernando Fernandes de Piña, a descendent of the same house, took part in the <a href="battle%20of%20Salado">battle of Salado</a> under <a href="Alfonso%20XI">Alfonso XI</a> of Castille and went to <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> in 1282 as an ambassador of <a href="Peter%20III">Peter III</a>, King of Aragón. He was also member of the entourage of <a href="Queen%20Isabel">Queen Isabel</a> of Aragón, wife of <a href="Dinis">Dinis</a>, King of Portugal.

Lord Ademar Renaldo de Piña was the last known descendent whom took part in the Colonial expansion under the <a href="crown%20of%20Castile">crown of Castile</a>, initiated by the Spanish <a href="conquistadores">conquistadores</a> in 1492 continuing for over three centuries, the Spanish Empire would expand across the Caribbean Islands, half of South America, most of Central America and much of North America (including present day Mexico, Florida and the Southwestern and Pacific Coastal regions of the United States). It is estimated that during the colonial period (1492–1832), a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era (1850–1950).

Present day.
The family line was thought extinct after Ademar Renaldo de Piña's relocation to Central America ( present day <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> ) during the Colonial expansion under the <a href="crown%20of%20Castile">crown of Castile</a>, until a recent discovery proved Ronald Armando Piña ( 1958–present ) to be a direct descendent of Sancho de Piña, whom has reclaimed his family's title.

London Resort

The London Resort is a proposed entertainment complex in <a href="Swanscombe">Swanscombe</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. The project was announced on 8 October 2012 and it is estimated to open by around 2022.

Resort Proposal.
The proposed plan for London Resort included an entertainment street, a water park, a theme park, approximately 5,000 hotel rooms and a monorail service linking the resort to <a href="Ebbsfleet%20International%20railway%20station">Ebbsfleet International station</a>.

Development.
The site straddles the border of the <a href="Dartford%20%28borough%29">Dartford</a> and <a href="Gravesham">Gravesham</a> boroughs and both authorities have pledged their support. In July 2014 the first community consultation was held with a short series of exhibitions in the area around the peninsula.

The timetable for delivery, including the planning application process and construction timetable, is geared towards completion and opening in 2019. A planning application to Dartford Borough Council is expected to be made in 2015. The project leader is Tony Sefton of London Resort Company Holdings.

In April 2013 newspaper reports claimed development may be delayed by the discovery of a rare species of spider. Mr. Sefton pledged to remove the colony of distinguished jumping spiders (<a href="Sitticus%20distinguendus">Sitticus distinguendus</a>) to another suitable site.

The following month, the "Kent Messenger" reported that plans for the theme park could be endangered if a new <a href="Lower%20Thames%20Crossing">lower Thames road crossing</a> is sited over the Swanscombe Peninsula and quoted Mr. Sefton as saying "It could really scupper plans. We are in the final throes of negotiating a very large investment and this makes it very difficult." However, the proposal was rejected in December of that year.

The park may spur the development of a new <a href="Garden%20city%20movement">Garden City</a> development at nearby <a href="Ebbsfleet%20Valley">Ebbsfleet</a>.

Infrastructure and Transport.
The closest station to the proposed site is served by Southeastern services from <a href="Charing%20Cross%20railway%20station">London Charing Cross</a> via and to . A short distance away, is a <a href="High%20Speed%201">High Speed 1</a> station. Trains run from <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">London St Pancras</a> (17 minutes), <a href="Gare%20du%20Nord">Paris Gare du Nord (North)</a>, and in the future, ; London Resort Company holdings predict the park will add two to three million passengers a year to the HS1 line. A new monorail may take passengers from Ebbsfleet International station to the New Paramount resort. A further 250,000 people may travel directly to the park from central London by 'water taxis' along the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>; project leader Tony Sefton has said he aims for the park to have the "lowest modal mix" of car park spaces of any similar resort in the world.

Changes to local infrastructure will be necessary to accommodate millions of additional visitors annually to <a href="North%20West%20Kent">North West Kent</a>, though it is possible the route of a planned <a href="Lower%20Thames%20Crossing">new Thames road crossing</a> may be in part decided as a result of this development.

<a href="Crossrail">Crossrail</a>'s route may be altered to run as far east as <a href="Hoo%20Junction">Hoo Junction</a>, just beyond <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Kent">Gravesend</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>; there are no firm plans to run trains beyond in south east London. It is not known if the plans for Paramount London will create a viable case for Crossrail services to serve the park. The Hoo Peninsula was also one of the proposed <a href="London%20Britannia%20Airport">Thames Estuary airport sites</a>, although this was rejected in 2014 in favour of expansion at either <a href="Heathrow">Heathrow</a> or <a href="Gatwick">Gatwick</a> airports. There are also plans to create a road joining the theme park onto the A2 in Kent.

Environmental Concerns.
The development would be built on 872 acres of mostly <a href="Salt%20marsh">saltmarsh</a> (and a small amount of <a href="Brownfield%20land">brownfield</a> land) on the <a href="Swanscombe">Swanscombe</a> peninsula, part of the <a href="Environmentally%20Sensitive%20Area">Environmentally Sensitive Area</a> known as <a href="North%20Kent%20Marshes">North Kent Marshes</a>, and be twice the size of the <a href="Olympic%20Park%2C%20London">Olympic Park</a> in East London. The development would lie in the floodplain of the <a href="River%20Thames">Inner Thames</a>, using up one of the few remaining patches of the floodplain that is wild and undeveloped, and which is also used to accept floodwaters in order to reduce the pressure on the critical flood defences of the river. There is also concern given the marshland in question is home to several species which are endangered in the UK, including; the <a href="https%3A//www.buglife.org.uk/bugs-and-habitats/distinguished-jumping-spider">Distinguished Jumping Spider</a>, <a href="European%20water%20vole">Water Vole</a>, and <a href="Western%20marsh%20harrier">Marsh Harrier</a>.

After Paramount withdrew from the project, London Resort Company Holdings insisted the project would continue as planned but without the Paramount brand.

In July 2017, it was rumoured by various sources within the theme park community that the developers were in talks with NBC Universal about creating a <a href="Universal%20Parks%20%26amp%3B%20Resorts">Universal Theme Park</a> on the site.

Vice City (Grand Theft Auto fictional city)

Vice City is the setting for and .

Description.
Vice City is based on <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, which was a major cocaine trans-shipment point for <a href="South%20America">South America</a> at the time. This is further reinforced with its theme of the drug business and crime, as well as the presence of new upper-class businesses and residents in the city, with some of them likely to be funded by the drug business. Vice City is specifically located within the state of Florida.

Vice City consists of two major islands and six smaller islands; both major islands are separated by a large body of water similar to that of Biscayne Bay, which separates Miami Beach from mainland Miami. Each major island is divided into several districts. The population of Vice City is given at around 1.8 million in 1986[1].

The city has four hospitals (two in each major island) and four police stations (two in each major island) distributed evenly in the city; these facilities serve as respawn points after the player dies or is arrested. The city also has one fire station and an air base known as Fort Baxter Military Base. Unlike Liberty City and the state of San Andreas, however, Vice City has no known railway or rapid transit systems, and all islands are connected by road and bridges.




Weather.
Vice City is located in a tropical climate. The city is also exposed to hurricanes like Miami or any other city in South Florida; in 1986, Hurricane Hermione was forecast to strike Vice City, which forced the closing of all bridges to and from the mainland. When the storm system changed course before it could hit, the bridges were reopened.

In both games, Vice City seems to be in the middle of the summer rainy season, having long, hot, humid days and occasional tropical thunderstorms, much like Miami in summer.

Differences Between GTA Vice City and GTA Vice City Stories.
The Vice City featured in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories is based on the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City version of the city, but set two years earlier in 1984. The majority of the city remained the same but contains several noticeable differences in its landscape from its "future" depiction.









The Clymenus Suite, a single streamline modern-styled building (which features a jetty, garage and helipad) exists in the immediate north of the Washington Beach fairground, on what would be the site of low-rise apartments in 1986.






In addition to all the changes within the two years, the buildings in GTA Vice City Stories rendition feature more neon-lights and is more glorious and cleaner compared to the sequel.

Gang Control.
The distribution of gangs in Vice City circa 1984 is significantly different due largely to activities surrounding the Vance Crime Family, which rose to prominence that year. Their subsequent dominance has devastated a number of existing gangs which previously had a significant stake in the city. In the beginning of GTA Vice City Stories, a number of previously unheard of gangs in Vice City are also present before they disbanded or were wiped out by Victor Vance and his organization.

Trailer Park Mafia, a redneck gang led by Marty Jay Williams, operates from the trailer park near Sunshine Autos and controls much of Vice City's poorer communities, and operates several small businesses. The gang engages in a brief war with the Cholos, seizing more businesses in Little Haiti. With the death of Marty at the hands of Victor Vance, the gang is disbanded as the Vance Crime Family takes control of all his operations. 
The Cholos, a Hispanic gang, are known to be in control of Little Havana and Little Haiti in 1984. The Cubans, led by Umberto Robina, would wage a fierce and violent gang war on the Cholos. The war concluded with the destruction of the Cholo's large illegal arms storage warehouse in Little Haiti by Los Cabrones and Victor Vance, forcing surviving Cholo members to surrender and consolidate with Los Cabrones. 
With the defeat of the Cholos, the Cubans/Los Cabrones control Little Havana by 1986, while the Haitians are also presumed to move into Little Haiti after the Cholos disappear.

The Sharks control the Washington Beach and Ocean Beach areas of the city, dominating in smuggling, robbery, and drug trafficking. After their businesses are seized by the Vance Crime Family, the gang is suggested to have become the Streetwannabes street gang by 1986.

As Victor Vance is dishonorably discharged from the military, the Mendez Cartel, headed by brothers Armando and Diego Mendez, set up shop in Vice City and become the most powerful criminal organization in the city, basing their operations at Prawn Island and becoming rivals of Diaz's Gang. Originally allied with the Vance Crime Family, they eventually betrayed Victor, leading to their own deaths (with the help of Ricardo Diaz) and the collapse of their organization.

With the defeat of the Mendez Cartel, the Streetwannabes control the northern half of the now dilapidated Prawn Island, specifically, the former residences of the Mendez Cartel and the Diaz's gang become the most powerful criminal organization in Vice City.

In addition, the Biker gang, which is featured in GTA Vice City, is stronger and more influential in 1984 than they are in 1986, controlling many businesses in Downtown and Vice Point. It is assumed that the rise of the Vance Crime Family has resulted in the Biker Gang losing control of their businesses, leaving them with only the Greasy Chopper Bar by 1986. An offshoot of the Biker Gang, the Stallionz, is featured in Vice City Stories, consisting of homosexual white supremacists. The White Stallionz are wiped out in 1984 by Victor in a bar dubbed "Stallionz," named after the gang.

As a result of the shift of power in Vice City, it is assumed the Vance Crime Family controls a fair share of the city, and both Victor and Lance agree to leave Vice City for several years to lay low and live off of their drug money in the Dominican Republic after Victor kills the Mendez Brothers. In 1986, the Vance Brothers are active in Vice City, although their organization's current size and stake in the city is unknown. Victor is killed at the beginning of Vice City, and with Lance being killed by Tommy Vercetti, the Vance Crime Family's activities are ended. The Vercetti Gang would then become the most powerful organization in Vice City, with virtually all districts under complete control of Tommy Vercetti.

Shipwrecks.
There are three shipwrecks at the bottom of the ocean. One is a sunken Reefer, located under the bridge between Downtown and Prawn Island. The other two are sunken container ships, one north of the Vice Point Mall and the other on the very south-west corner of Ocean Beach. In addition, there is what appears to be a submarine watching over the wreckage of the northern container ship wreckage.

Sports Teams.
There is only one known sports team in Vice City in 1986, the Vice City Mambas. They have one known player in 1986, BJ Smith. In Grand Theft Auto Advance, which takes place in 2000 another player is mentioned; Jose Pimsoll, who also appears in a Downtown Ammu-Nation billboard stating he protects his family with guns from Ammu-Nation, who is the <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> of the Mambas from 1984-2000 The Mambas are assumed to play in Hyman Memorial Stadium, in Downtown Vice City. The Mambas are most likely based on real life Miami football team, the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>.

Life and Early Career.

Luis Nery (boxer)

Luis Nery (born "Luis Esteban Neri Hernández"; born December 12, 1994) is a Mexican <a href="professional%20boxer">professional boxer</a> who has held the <a href="World%20Boxing%20Council">WBC</a> and "<a href="The%20Ring%20%28magazine%29">The Ring</a>" <a href="bantamweight">bantamweight</a> titles since August 2017.

Professional career.
Early career.
Nery was born and fights out of Tijuana. He only fought 9 amateur bouts, winning all of them. 5 of them ended by way of knockout. Nery made his professional debut on May 2012 at the age of 17.

Nery won his first 18 fights before challenging for the vacant <a href="World%20Boxing%20Council">WBC</a> Continental bantamweight title against Martín Casillas. Casillas was knocked down twice during the fight as Nery took a unanimous decision (100-88, 99-89, 98-90). Nery's one defense of that regional title came against former interim <a href="super%20flyweight">super flyweight</a> world champion <a href="David%20S%C3%A1nchez%20%28boxer%29">David Sánchez</a>. After an early head clash that threatened to stop the fight, Nery dominated Sánchez landing a series of power punches that broke Sánchez down. The former interim world titlist was knocked down in the 5th round and retired in the stool. On December 2016, Nery was knocked down for the first time in his pro career in the opening stanza of a bout against Raymond Tabugon. Despite the knockdown, the fight was mostly one-sided as Nery battered Tabugon until the referee stopped it in the fourth round. 

Nery vs. Yamanaka.
Although Nery spoke of challenging for a <a href="super%20flyweight">super flyweight</a> title, his first shot at a world title would come against WBC and <a href="List%20of%20The%20Ring%20world%20champions%23Bantamweight">"The Ring"</a> bantamweight champion <a href="Shinsuke%20Yamanaka">Shinsuke Yamanaka</a> on August 15, 2017, which he won with a sensational fourth-round stoppage. The bout started with both fighters trading back and forth combinations, but at the start of the fourth round Nery rocked Yamanaka with a left cross. After a brief respite in which Yamanaka seemed to regain control, Nery continued pummeling the defending champion, who was unable to defend himself. Yamanaka's corner eventually rushed into the ring to protect their fighter, giving Nery the win. The fight was seen by an audience of over 7 million in Japan

Ida Ivanka Kubler

Ida Ivanka Kubler (born January 3, 1978) is an international artist based in New York.

Work.
Kubler's artwork features recycled materials and other objects, including silk cocoons, feathers, tree branches and other materials. Color is an inspiration to Kubler and her work. The genre of her work is a blend of <a href="Abstract%20Expressionism">Abstract Expressionism</a> and <a href="Color%20Field">Color Field</a> painting. In her early years she practiced painting in a naturalistic realistic manner, focusing mostly on figures, portraits, still life and landscapes. Her style evolved as she experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas.
Kubler is best known for her series The Birth of an Idea. These artworks have been described as "Organic in appearance; abstract in presence. They have a being and an atmosphere that transmits to the viewer calmness and vibrancy at once. I felt touched and enlightened." 'The Birth of an Idea' was included in 'Placebos for Art' a project undertaken by the Behring Institute for Medical Research and was judged to have positive influence on public health. The simple circle settings consisting of an abundance of sculptured silk cocoons on a large canvas. The cocoons are painted, manipulated and positioned. Kubler has created two and three colour versions of the series, some with additional elements like ink markings or red and blue dots. "The art is at once transcendentally primitive embodying a universal oneness of geometric circle, with a subtle play of patterns. A reinvention of Indian <a href="Mandala">Mandala</a>s or reminiscent of mosaic in Ancient Greece, an assemblage and repetition of small particles. In modern parlance the repetition in Kubler’s artwork could be seen as deconstructed pixelation."

In addition Kubler has developed two other series. The “Non Material” series. These are paintings, oil on canvas, depicting scenes on the border between abstraction and realism and are dreamy-ghost-like paintings. And “The Thing” series, oil on canvas, which are half-abstract figurative series of nudes walking in the nothingness.

Notable exhibitions.
Kubler has exhibited in New York (Chinatown Soup Gallery, May 2016 ; Sohotel Artspace April 2015 ; Dejavu Gallery previously <a href="Bodley%20Gallery">Bodley Gallery</a> November 2015), Malaga, Spain (Stoa Gallery, December 2015) and London (Store Street Gallery April 2013; Chance Gallery, October 2013.

E (Enslaved album)

E is the fourteenth studio album by the <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a> band <a href="Enslaved%20%28band%29">Enslaved</a>. The album is set for release on October 13, 2017 by <a href="Nuclear%20Blast">Nuclear Blast</a>. The concept of the album lies in both its meaning as a letter in the latin alphabet, and its runic reference. Its cover artwork was once again hand-painted by the Norwegian artist Truls Espedal.

Musical style and writing.
Guitarist Ivar Bjørnson explains about the title of "E":

"The concept of the album lies in both it’s [sic] meaning as a letter in the latin alphabet, and it’s [sic] runic reference: the rune "Ehwaz", that is depicted as an "M" when drawn as [a] rune (just to make sure it gets really confusing) – the runes are drawn to look like what they literally mean. Ehwaz (pronounced and used as what's known as E, but drawn as an “M”) looks like and means 'horse'. Which is closely linked to its esoteric meaning; which is 'trust' and 'co-operation'. One of mankind's oldest and deepest pairings/collaborations with any "outside" entities is with the horse. When they were first tamed and utilised there must have arisen the notion of some esoteric link between the two; now we could move swiftly, escape faster and even eat and drink from the animal (both horse milk and horse blood), and of course show off and brag before our enemies and peers with the most spectacular horses.

So, no, it is not about horses! It is about the symbioses that surrounds us; which are vital to our existence, to our development – on all scales: man and vessel (for instance horse, yes), a person and its significant other, child and parent, musician and instrument, chaos and order, subconscious and conscious, Oden and Sleipnir – wisdom and communication. There are many levels and variations of this concept on the album; the duality of man and nature, present and past personalities within one self, the conscious fear and the subconscious drive. And other symbiosis." 

Recording and production.
Simply titled "E", the album was written by guitarist Ivar Bjørnson (music, lyrics) and singer/bassist Grutle Kjellson (lyrics), and marks the introduction of the band's new keyboardist and clean vocalist Håkon Vinje, after the 2016 departure of Herbrand Larsen. The album was mixed and mastered at Fascination Street Studios by Jens Bogren, and includes several guest musicians for the songs "Hiindsiight"' and '"Feathers Of Eolh", including <a href="Wardruna">Wardruna</a>'s Einar Kvitrafn Selvik, flutist Daniel Mage and jazz saxophonist Kjetil Møster.

“It is absolutely fantastic to be in the studio with these new songs", stated Ivar Bjørnson. "So many doors were opened with In Times and the times [sic] that followed; for us as a band, for me as a composer and I guess for us all on a personal level. I have never worked this hard to put together music for an album before, and that intensity continues into the studio where everybody is giving their everything, every hour of every day. We are a tighter unit than ever before, which is obvious sonically. The concept conjured by myself and old war-brother Grutle is the strongest we have worked with. Finally, I am proud that we have taken more risks than ever before, and one in particular - and it is yielding awesome results. What does that mean? Stay tuned to find out!” 

"I'm always psyched and proud when we have finished an album recording, and this is no exception!" said singer Grutle Kjellson. "It was a really exciting process this time, with the line-up change and everything, so although it wasn't a dramatic change, the band dynamics were suddenly different. But, it was like a little re-boot, a fresh start so to speak. The studio sessions were great, and we all feel that we have done something truly amazing. We hope you'll enjoy it."

Music video.
The music video was directed by <a href="Floria%20Sigismondi">Floria Sigismondi</a>. It shows Glass being tied down and surrounded by flowers in various settings, including a nature-consumed room, an abandoned vintage car and an empty pool. When asked about the core message of the song, Floria wrote in an email to "<a href="The%20Fader">The Fader</a>": "I like the idea of something beautiful and dark living simultaneously in the same place, 'Without Love' has those themes. There are also themes of losing yourself, being told how to be, what to say ('tell me what to spit'). The garden vines are a metaphor for this." She wrote that she was inspired by the works of ceramic artist <a href="Jessica%20Cooper">Jessica Cooper</a> for this video.

Critical reception.
"<a href="Under%20the%20Radar%20%28magazine%29">Under the Radar</a>" described the song as "a slice of pop indulgence" and "a cleaner outing then her previous offering". Jack Tregoning of <a href="Junkee">Junkee</a> wrote that the song "finds Glass in a glossier mood", and includes "spiky edges" and "a new electronic-pop sheen". Lisa Wright of "<a href="DIY%20%28magazine%29">DIY</a>" described the song as "a bleak and introspective return" and "a surprisingly self-lacerating offering" from Glass. Michael Cuby of "<a href="Paper%20%28magazine%29">Paper</a>" called the song "an instantly recognizable blend of beauty and macabre that will make any former Crystal Castles fan stare in awe". Lauren O'Neill of "<a href="Vice%20%28magazine%29">Vice</a>" felt that Glass "delivered a <a href="Grimes%20%28musician%29">Grimes</a>-esque sad synth number with a big pop-sensibility". Justin Moran of "<a href="Out%20%28magazine%29">Out</a>" regarded the song as "a glittery dark-pop number that carries the same dramatic weight as Glass' work before". Sasha Geffen of "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" wrote the song sees Glass "singing gently and calmly, with breathy accents that belong more to the world of <a href="synth-pop">synthpop</a> artists like <a href="Purity%20Ring%20%28band%29">Purity Ring</a> than her punk and <a href="electroclash">electroclash</a> past."

Massasoit Guards

The Massasoit Guards were an African-American <a href="militia">militia</a> company active in 1850s Boston. Clothing retailer <a href="John%20Coburn%20House">John P. Coburn</a> founded the group to police <a href="Beacon%20Hill%2C%20Boston">Beacon Hill</a> and protect residents from <a href="slave%20catchers">slave catchers</a>. Attorney <a href="Robert%20Morris%20%28lawyer%29">Robert Morris</a> repeatedly petitioned the Massachusetts legislature on their behalf, but the Massasoit Guards were never officially recognized or supported by the state. The group was a precursor to the <a href="54th%20Massachusetts%20Regiment">54th Massachusetts Regiment</a>.

History.
Founding.
After Congress passed the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Law%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Law of 1850</a>, Boston and other Northern cities were no longer safe havens for refugees from slavery. Black communities began forming independent militias to protect residents from slave catchers: the Attucks Guards in New York City, the Hannibal Guards in Pittsburgh, the Detroit Military Guards, and many others. In Boston, the first black militia was called the Massasoit Guards.

The group was founded in 1854 by John Coburn, a Beacon Hill clothing retailer and co-owner of a profitable gaming house. Coburn was a member of the <a href="Boston%20Vigilance%20Committee">Boston Vigilance Committee</a> and treasurer of the <a href="New%20England%20Freedom%20Association">New England Freedom Association</a>, both organizations dedicated to helping fugitive slaves. Coburn also personally served as captain of the Massasoit Guards. The unit was named for <a href="Massasoit">Massasoit</a>, a 17th-century <a href="Wampanoag">Wampanoag</a> leader. Abolitionist <a href="William%20Cooper%20Nell">William Cooper Nell</a> remarked on the choice of name in 1855: 

Perhaps, as the name of Attucks has already been appropriated by colored military companies in New York and Cincinnati, they accepted Massasoit as their patron saint. He was one of those Indian chiefs, who, in early colonial times, proved himself signally friendly to the interests of the Old Bay State.

That same year, the editor of the "Boston Evening Telegraph" questioned the wisdom of creating an all-black company:

And we are somewhat at a loss to see why our colored friends, who so reasonably objected to being set apart as a class in the schools, should now voluntarily set themselves apart as a class in the military.

The group may have come together informally before 1854. According to historian <a href="Mary%20Ellen%20Snodgrass">Mary Ellen Snodgrass</a>, several members of the Massasoit Guards were involved in the rescue of <a href="Shadrach%20Minkins">Shadrach Minkins</a> in 1851. Minkins had escaped slavery in Virginia and was working in Boston when he was arrested by federal marshals and imprisoned in the court house. A group of about 20 black activists led by <a href="Lewis%20Hayden">Lewis Hayden</a> stormed the court house and rescued Minkins by force. John Coburn was among those arrested in connection with the rescue, but was acquitted of all charges. 

Legal struggles.
During the mid-1850s, attorney Robert Morris repeatedly petitioned to include the Massasoit Guards in the <a href="Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Militia">Massachusetts Volunteer Militia</a>, and to have the word "white" stricken from the state's militia law. At the time, federal militia law as well as Massachusetts state law stipulated that only white men could serve. Many whites were threatened by the thought of black men being provided with weapons and military training. Denied the use of state weapons, the Guards purchased their own gear and continued to operate outside the law for several years.

Morris and other advocates emphasized that blacks were native-born American citizens, unlike the immigrants who, at that time, were arriving in large numbers at the Port of Boston. Morris once remarked before the legislature's militia committee, "Some of the petitioners whom I have the honor to represent, can trace back their ancestry to a time long before an Englishman or any white foreigner stood upon American ground." William J. Watkins was more explicit: "All we ask is that you treat us as well as you do the Irish, German, Hungarian." Despite the appeal to <a href="Nativism%20%28politics%29">nativism</a>, which was on the rise in Massachusetts, their petitions were denied. Eventually the Massasoit Guards gave up in frustration and disbanded.

<doc id="54848869" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54848869" title="Alcohol and pregnancy">
Alcohol and pregnancy

Alcohol in pregnancy is the use of alcohol (<a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>) during gestation. This also includes the time period between conception and awareness of the pregnancy. Alcohol use not only can result in <a href="Fetal%20Alcohol%20Spectrum%20Disorder">Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder</a> (FASD), but it can result in only one or few disorders and conditions. Not all women who consume alcohol during pregnancy will have a baby with all of the features and characteristics of FASP. Alcohol use during pregnancy also can cause spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birthweight, and prematurity. Alcohol consumption can begin in the later stages of pregnancy after the development of facial characteristics of an infant are almost fully developed. Not all infants exposed to alcohol in utero will have defects related to the alcohol consumption. Alcohol use during pregnancy can also result in the inability to care for an infant after the birth if the drinking continues. The use of alcohol during pregnancy is associated with domestic violence and potential harm to the infant.

Embryology.
Different body systems in the infant grow, mature and develop at specific times during gestation. The consumption of alcohol during one or more of these developmental stages may only result in one or few conditions.

From conception and to the third week, the most susceptible systems and organs are the brain, spinal cord, and heart. Though these body systems complete their development later in the pregnancy, the effects of alcohol consumption early in the pregnancy can result in defects to these systems and organs.

During the fourth week of gestation, the limbs are being formed and it is at this point that alcohol can effect the development of arms, legs, fingers and toes. The eyes and ears also form during the fourth week and are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol.

By the sixth week of gestation, the teeth and palate are forming and alcohol consumption at this time will effect these structures.

By the 20th week of gestation the formation of organs and organ systems is well-developed. The infant is still susceptible to the damaging effects of alcohol.

The baby’s brain, body, and organs are developing throughout pregnancy and can be affected by exposure to alcohol at any time. Because every pregnancy is different, drinking alcohol may hurt one baby more than another. A child that has been affected by alcohol before birth may be appear 'normal' at birth. Intellectual disabilities may not appear until the child begins school.

After birth.
When an infant is born and appears to be healthy, the baby may still have non-visible disorders and organ defects due to exposure to alcohol during the pregnancy. Social problems in the child have been found to be associated with alcohol use during gestation. Alcohol is a cause of microcephaly.

Alcohol use during pregnancy is does not effect the ability to breastfeed the infant. In addition, an infant may breastfeed even if the mother continues to consume alcohol after the birth. An infant born to a mother that has an alcohol dependency may go through alcohol withdrawal after the birth.

Treatment.
A woman may elect to discontinue alcohol once she knows that she is pregnant. A woman can have serious symptoms that accompany alcohol withdrawal during pregnancy. These symptoms can be treated during pregnancy with benzodiazepine.

Epidemiology.
One out of 67 women who drink alcohol during pregnancy will have a child with a birth defect. The five countries with the highest prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy were The highest prevalence of alcohol consumption by pregnant women is in Ireland (about 60%), Belarus (47%), Denmark (46%), the UK (41%) and the Russian Federation (37%). The lowest prevalence is in those nations whose religious beliefs govern their alcohol consumption. Birth defects caused by alcohol consumption may be up to 1% in many places. This may mean that FASD may be higher than anencephaly, Down syndrome, spina bifida and trisomy 18. Globally, one in 10 women drink alcohol during pregnancy. Out of this population, 20% <a href="binge%20drink">binge drink</a> and have four or more alcoholic drinks per single occasion.

"Binge drinking is the direct cause of FAS or FASD. These findings are alarming because half of the pregnancies in developed countries and over 80% in developing countries are unplanned. That means that many women don’t realize they are pregnant during the early stages and that they continue drinking when pregnant."

Public policy.
Starting in 1981, the <a href="surgeon%20general">surgeon general</a> of the United States started releasing a warning asking pregnant women to <a href="Teetotalism">abstain from alcohol</a> for the remainder of gestation.

Ben-Zion Alfes

Rabbi Ben-Zion Alfes (1851-1941) was a renowned multi-lingual author and lecturer on Jewish religious subjects. Of his sixty or so books, his best known is "Maase Alfes." The last work he saw published, written at age 90, was an autobiography titled "The Life Story of the Maase Alfes." Another work, Toledot ve-Zikhronot. also an autobiography, but with a different focus, was published posthumously.

Early life.
He was born in <a href="Vilna">Vilna</a> "to Rabbi Yirmeyahu Akiva on the first of Kislev, 5611 (1851)." His post-<a href="Bar%20Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvah</a> education with his father ended at age 15 upon the passing of his father. At that point, he went to study at the Eishyshok yeshiva.

Connections to the Vilna Gaon.
He studied in a <a href="Yeshiva">Yeshiva</a> with affiliations to the <a href="Vilna%20Gaon">Vilna Gaon</a>, some of whose students were now teaching there. In particular, 
"he became close with the son-in-law of Rabbi Avraham, the brother of the Vilna Gaon."

Mid life.
For a while it seemed that Rabbi Alfes's 1872 attempt to live in Israel would fail for a lack of a livelihood. Upon returning to Vilna he found work as a proof-reader at HaChevra Metz publishing house. 

An attempt at writing books for Jewish youngsters was the beginning of his writing career, especially since he received a <a href="Haskama">Haskama</a>
from the <a href="Chofetz%20Chaim">Chofetz Chaim</a>. He also translated many religious Hebrew works into Yiddish.

His name also became well known due to public lectures and a network of schools, Toras Chesed, geared to orphans and children from impoverished backgrounds.

Later life.
His 1925 second try at living in Israel was successful. Not long after arriving in <a href="Petah%20Tikvah">Petah Tikvah</a> he became spiritual director of the Tiferet Bachurim society.

Yiddish accomplishments.
He punctuated his <a href="Yiddish-language">Yiddish-language</a> translations/commentaries on <a href="Siddur">Siddur</a>, as well as <a href="Yom%20Tov">Holiday</a> prayer books (Machzorim) with Hebrew vowels, "giving them the external appearance of Hebrew." This was of major benefit to women whose education taught them the Yiddish language and the Hebrew/Yiddish alphabet, but not the Hebrew language, as shown by the popularity of the <a href="Tseno_Ureno">Tzeneh Renneh</a>.

A biography noted that he was called by some the "Pioneer of Orthodox Yiddish literature.”

Family.
He and his wife Nechama had six children:

The inaugural councillors were Alexander Lorimer, F. William Kleinschmidt, William Kelly, James Johnston, and Johann D. Weinert.

Biography.
Breslin was born July 11, 1946 in <a href="Ottawa%2C%20Illinois">Ottawa, Illinois</a>. After graduating from a Catholic high school in the Ottawa area, Breslin moved to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> to attend <a href="Loyola%20University%20Chicago">Loyola University</a>. In 1967, she graduated from Loyola with a <a href="bachelor%20of%20arts">bachelor of arts</a> in political science. Three years later, she graduated from <a href="Loyola%20University%20Chicago%20School%20of%20Law">Loyola University School of Law</a> and went into private practice. She was a legal advisor to the <a href="Illinois%20State%20Board%20of%20Education">Illinois State Board of Education</a> from 1974 to 1976.

In 1976, she was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as one of three members from the 38th district. At that time, the 38th encompassed all of <a href="Livingston%20County%2C%20Illinois">Livingston County</a> parts of <a href="DeKalb%20County%2C%20Illinois">DeKalb</a>, <a href="Kane%20County%2C%20Illinois">Kane</a>, <a href="Kendall%20County%2C%20Illinois">Kendall</a> and <a href="LaSalle%20County%2C%20Illinois">LaSalle</a> counties. As Breslin had voted in Chicago while a Loyola student, she did not meet the constitutionally mandated two-year residency requirement to serve as an Illinois State Representative. She was removed from the Illinois House by a 91-74 vote. The next day, the Democratic chairmen of the five county parties in the 38th district appointed Breslin to the seat from which she had been removed. A group of legislators led by <a href="Edward%20Bluthardt">Edward Bluthardt</a> raised the residency question in a lawsuit. The judge ruled the House action ousting her was legal and that her reappointment by the county chairmen was unconstitutional. On appeal, the <a href="Illinois%20Supreme%20Court">Illinois Supreme Court</a> declared the issue moot as the 80th General Assembly had ended.

After the passage of the <a href="Cutback%20Amendment">Cutback Amendment</a>, Breslin was reelected to the House from the 75th district, which included all of Lasalle and <a href="Putnam%20County%2C%20Illinois">Putnam</a> counties, southeastern <a href="Bureau%20County%2C%20Illinois">Bureau County</a>, and a small portion of eastern <a href="Marshall%20County%2C%20Illinois">Marshall County</a>. She rose through the ranks of the Democratic Party serving as both an Assistant Democratic Leader in the house and the Committeewoman for <a href="Illinois%27s%2014th%20congressional%20district">Illinois's 14th congressional district</a> on the central committee of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20of%20Illinois">Democratic Party of Illinois</a>.

In 1990, she ran for the Democratic nomination for <a href="Illinois%20Treasurer">Illinois Treasurer</a> against future Governor <a href="Pat%20Quinn%20%28politician%29">Pat Quinn</a>. Quinn, who had name recognition from his political activism including the Cutback Amendment and Citizens Utility Board, defeated Breslin with 450,217 to her 422,295. She was succeeded in the House by LaSalle County Clerk <a href="Tom%20Walsh%20%28Illinois%20politician%29">Tom Walsh</a>.

In 1992, she became the first woman elected an <a href="Illinois%20Appellate%20Court">Illinois Appellate Court</a> outside of <a href="Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois">Cook County</a> when she was elected in the <a href="Illinois%20Appellate%20Court%23Third%20District">Third District</a>. It was speculated that she would be the Democratic candidate for a seat on the Illinois Supreme Court in the 2000 election, but she chose not to run. Democratic candidate <a href="Thomas%20Kilbride">Thomas Kilbride</a> defeated Republican <a href="Carl%20Hawkinson">Carl Hawkinson</a> for the seat. Judge Breslin chose to retire rather than run for retention in 2002. On January 23, 2006, her son John passed away at age 22.

Early Indian treaty territories in Montana

A number of different <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> living in present-day <a href="Montana">Montana</a> entered into treaties with the United States during the 19th Century. Most of the treaties included an article that established the territory of the tribe (or tribes) entering into it. More and more of this Indian land turned into public or U.S. territory with the signing of new treaties. (See the maps).

Area 300.
<a href="Assiniboine">Assiniboine</a> Indian territory as described in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Laramie%20%281851%29">Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)</a>. The area changed into U.S. domain on April 13, 1875. In 1866, the Assiniboine had actually ceded the area by a treaty, which was never ratified.

Areas 373 and 374.
"Flathead, Kootenay and Upper Pond d'Oreille" used this range. The <a href="Ktunaxa">Kootenai</a> and Upper <a href="Pend%20d%27Oreille">Pend d'Oreille</a> (Kalispel) lived north of Flathead Lake. The Flathead (<a href="Confederated%20Salish%20and%20Kootenai%20Tribes%20of%20the%20Flathead%20Nation">Salish</a>) made camps in the valley south of it. Area 374 is the "Jocko Reserve" established by the Hellgate treaty in 1855.

Areas 398, 399, 565 and 574.
The <a href="Blackfeet%20Nation">Blackfeet Indians</a> and their Indian allies in the <a href="Gros%20Ventre">Gros Ventre</a> tribe hunted and pitched tipis here. Areas 398 (extending into Wyoming) and 399 is the Fort Laramie treaty (1851) territory of the Blackfoot Nation. It is something of an oddity, since the Blackfeet did not attend the treaty councils. On October 17, 1855, area 398 became shared hunting grounds for "ninety-nine" years and the Blackfeet accepted camps of the Flathead, Upper Pend d'Oreille, Kootenay and <a href="Nez%20Perce%20people">Nez Perce</a>, as well as whites, on the ranges. Further, they allowed the Assiniboine to hunt on a part of their easternmost treaty range (area 565) bordering present-day North Dakota (indicated with a black line). The green area 399 is not included in the 1855 treaty territory of the Blackfeet, but it was first formally relinquished on July 5, 1873, by executive order. Area 574 was ceded by executive orders of April 15 and August 18, 1874. The reserve thus left to the Blackfeet in 1874 (area 565 without the common hunting ground bordering North Dakota) would diminish later. Today, both the Blackfeet Reservation, the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation, the <a href="Fort%20Belknap%20Indian%20Reservation">Fort Belknap Indian Reservation</a> and the <a href="Fort%20Peck%20Indian%20Reservation">Fort Peck Indian Reservation</a> is located within this former Blackfeet treaty land between the Missouri and Canada.

Areas 517, 619 and 635.
The three areas together indicate the <a href="Crow%20Nation">Crow Indian</a> territory in Montana as defined in the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851). Areas 619 and 635 show the smaller <a href="Crow%20Indian%20Reservation">Crow Indian Reservation</a> established on May 7, 1868.

Ares 532.
This is a vacuum in the cessions of Indian land. With adjoining tribal areas outside Montana, the territory was claimed by "Methow, Okanagan, Kooteny, Pend d'Oreille, Colville, North Spokane, San Poeil, and other tribes". When tribal reservations were established in other states in 1872, the United States "simply took possession" of area 532 on "December 0, 1871".

Areas 529 and 620.
The combined areas show the westernmost land recognized as <a href="Arikara">Arikara</a>, <a href="Hidatsa">Hidatsa</a> and <a href="Mandan">Mandan</a> territory in the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851). The United States came into possession of area 529 by executive order of April 12, 1870, and area 620 by executive order of July 13, 1880.

Area 597.
The two gray areas at the right bottom of the map indicate the northwestern edges of a larger <a href="Lakota%20people">Lakota</a> territory in the present-day Dakotas and Wyoming as described in the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851).

The Northern Cheyennes.
The <a href="Cheyenne">Northern Cheyennes</a> are not mentioned here, since the treaties defining Indian territories in Montana antedate the arrival of them. They (along with the <a href="Arapaho">Northern Arapahos</a> and the Lakotas) advanced into Montana during the <a href="Sioux%20Wars">Sioux Wars</a> in the mid-1860s and the 1870s. The western part of the present <a href="Northern%20Cheyenne%20Indian%20Reservation">Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation</a> is end-to-end with the eastern and longer border of the Crow reservation in the central part of the 1851 Crow treaty territory (yellow area 517).

The Chippewas and the Crees.
The <a href="Ojibwe">Chippewas</a> and the <a href="Cree">Crees</a> are other groups of Native Americans without a long history in Montana. The <a href="Rocky%20Boy%20Indian%20Reservation">Rocky Boy Indian Reservation</a> is located in the center of area 565.

Cải lương Chung Vô Diệm

Cải Lương: Chung Vô Diệm is a series of four individual plays of <a href="c%E1%BA%A3i%20l%C6%B0%C6%A1ng">cải lương</a>, released in <a href="DVD">DVD</a> form. It tells the story of an ugly woman named Chung Vô Diệm who became the Queen of King of Qi in Warring States Period of China. It is based on the apocryphal novel of same name which is widely circulated in China.

Plot.
The series consists of four plays.

Part I: Mão Đoan Tinh xuất thế.
This part recounts the rendezvous of Chung Vô Diệm and King of Qi Điền Hằng in a mulberry garden and her subsequent enthronement as the Queen of Qi. The King of Qi, advised by his close strategist, takes a stroll through the countryside. He encounters a tiger and when fleeing for his life, is saved by a veiled Chung Vô Diệm. Grateful and full with anticipation, the King promises to make her his queen. Chung Vô Diệm then lifts the veil and upon which the King is so scared by her demonic appearance that he immediately goes back on his words. Chung Vô Diệm, nevertheless, is born with supernatural powers as her previous incarnation is a fairy. She threatens to beat the King if he ever dares to cheat her and the King reluctantly sticks to his promise, with his advisor Yến Anh as the witness to the marriage pact.

The King has no intention to create such an ugly woman as his Queen whatsoever and as soon as he arrives at his palace, ignores to keep his promise. This prompts Chung Vô Diệm to come to the capital herself to press his to fulfilling his part of the pact. Faced with death threat again, the King has to officially declare her his Queen and gives her the Palace of Chiêu Dương as her royal residence. It turns out to be another ruse of the King to get rid of her because the Palace has been run over by devils which has killed the first Queen. Chung Vô Diệm succeeds to drive out the residential demons and retrieves a lot of magical artifacts. The King, seeing her alive and kicking, struggles to find words to console and appease her. Having overcome her first challenge, Chung Vô Diệm's position as Queen of Qi is solidified.

The King's object of favor is then a concubine named Cao Kim Liên who is beautiful and talented as a dancer. Initially apprehensive of Chung Vô Diệm, she grows increasingly resentful towards the newly instated queen, seeing her as the one who seized her rightful throne. To eliminate the queen and pave the way for herself, she schemes, with implicit agreement from the King, to poison Chung Vô Diệm. The queen, with her divination skills, reads through her scheme and forces the concubine to gulp down her own poisoned wine.

Credit rolls as the concubine succumbs to the effects of her poison and the King arrives, apparently angered with his queen.

Part II: Chung Vô Diệm đại náo hội Kỳ Bàn.
Accused of murdering Cao Kim Liên in the previous part, Chung Vô Diệm is confined to the Cold Palace as a punishment. The Kings also recruits two beautiful women as his concubines: Trương Túy Vân as Eastern Consort and Hạ Nghinh Xuân as Western Consort.

The neighbor State of Yan, in an attempt to humiliate the State of Qi, has its envoy present a qin with strings made from lotus threads. No one is able to play the instrument and the King is advised to counsel the banished Queen. Chung Vô Diệm manages to play the instrument and has derogatory poems tattooed on the face of the envoy. As a result, war breaks out between countries. The King leads the army to counter the enemy but is surrounded in a border post. The Queen comes to his rescue. Despite being grateful to her for saving his life and his kingdom the second time, he cannot bring himself to consummate the marriage. The Queen's teacher then gives her a pair of earrings that changes her visage to be more beautiful and the royal couple has three nights with blissful love. After that, Chung Vô Diệm becomes pregnant.

Wars and confrontations continue to plague the border and during a battle, the Queen gives birth to her son. With enemies closing behind, she prays for the gods to conceal her newborn and rushes to the aid of her husband.

Back in the palace, the two new concubines scheme their ways to royal favor. Hạ Nghinh Xuân tricks Trương Túy Vân into expressing her hatred for Chung Vô Diệm and later counsels her to poison the Queen - the same ruse used by Cao Kim Liên before. The Eastern Consort is apprehensive in the first place but when a royal edict comes and dictates her to welcome the triumphant Queen, she becomes resolute. As she leaves to receive the returning Queen, Hạ Nghinh Xuân goes into a monologue, revealing the whole sweet talk as her grand scheme: to remove Trương Túy Vân as a romantic rival since she knows the ruse can be easily discovered by Chung Vô Diệm and to get rid of Chung Vô Diệm as the King will not spare her life if she kills Trương Túy Vân.

Casting.
A feature production, the series enlist the services of the most veteran actors/singers. Tài Linh played the role of Chung Vô Diệm and was the only actress to reprise the same role over the course of the long story. Many roles were acted by various actors/actresses and some played more than one role as the narration proceeded.

King of Qi Điền Hằng was played by Kim Tử Long in the first and second part and by Thanh Tòng in the following two parts. Thanh Tòng himself played the role of Yến Anh in the first part and was succeeded by Bửu Truyện in the next installments.

Kim Tử Long played various roles in the series: he starred King of Qi in the first two seasons, his adopted son Điền Côn in the third season and the future King of Qi Điền Nguyên in the finale. Chí Linh sticks to the portrait of righteous generals, starring Tôn Tháo in the first season and Điền Đơn in the last season. Bửu Truyện co-starred two roles at the same time - as the ignorant father of Chung Vô Diệm and as the adviser Yến Anh in the latter three sections and as it can be seen, the two never appear onstage together. Various males presents different characters and the heavy makeup allowed them to assume different identities.

Actresses underwent drastic changes in terms of character personalities. Thoại Mỹ was the patriotic Princess Yên Đơn in the first session and turned vicious as the treacherous Hạ Nghinh Xuân in the following three sessions. Vân Hà got the chance to display her varied acting: she played the gossipy and nosy second sister-in-law of Chung Vô Diệm in the first play, the beautiful yet vain and shallow Eastern Consort Trương Túy Vân in the second and third plays and the loyal and considerate Liêm Thoại Hoa - wife of Điền Côn in the fourth play. Thảo Nguyên, a less-known name, played Chung Vô Diệm's clumsy first sister-in-law in the first play and the handsome and chaste Northern Consort Trịnh Ngọc Thuyền in the last play.

Ledbury Estate

The Ledbury Estate is a large estate of social housing, in <a href="Peckham">Peckham</a> in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Southwark">London Borough of Southwark</a>. It is within the <a href="Old%20Kent%20Road">Old Kent Road</a> Opportunity Area. The four high rise, H-shaped tower blocks were constructed in the mid-1960s using pre-fabricated concrete panels.

In making fire safety checks in 2017, it had not been strengthened, as required after Ronan Point collapse in 1968, so was not safe. The gas supply was severed on the 10 August and residents immediately lost their hot water and cooking facilities. These will be restored after the building is made safe.

Location.
The estate is just south of the <a href="Old%20Kent%20Road">Old Kent Road</a>, part of the <a href="A2%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29">A2</a> from both <a href="Tower%20Bridge">Tower Bridge</a> and the <a href="Elephant%20and%20Castle">Elephant and Castle</a> it is adjacent to land used by <a href="George%20Livesey">George Livesey</a> for the <a href="South%20London%20Gasworks">South London Gasworks</a>.
It consists of houses and maisonettes on Hoyland Close, Commercial Way, Bird in the Bush Road, Naylor Road, Windspoint Drive, Ethward Road and Pencraig Way. There are four thirteen-storey tower blocks Bromyard House, Sarnesfield House, Peterchurch House and Skenfrith House.
Tower blocks.
The Ledbury blocks were constructed between 1968 and 1970 using a method called <a href="Plattenbau">large panel system</a>, in which giant concrete sections were bolted together on site. There was no supporting frame. Many companies produced these building systems,including Tracoba, Camus and Sectra in France, and Jespersen, Skarne and Larsen-Nielsen in Scandinavia. British construction firms such as <a href="John%20Laing">John Laing</a> and <a href="Taylor%20Woodrow">Taylor Woodrow-Anglian</a> used these systems, working for local housing authorities to quickly produce the new homes that were a political necessity in the 1960s. 

It was this technique was used at <a href="Ronan%20Point">Ronan Point</a> which partly collapsed in 1968 following a gas explosion.

The blocks were constructed for Greater London council using the <a href="Larsen-Nielsen">Larsen-Nielsen</a> method. They are 13 storeys high and contain 56 flats, all except those on the top floor accessible by a lift and stairs, the top floor only by stairs. One lift serves the even numbered floors, and a second lift serves floor 12 and the odd numbered floors. The block is 28m x 20m and 39m to the 13th floor, floor plate They are the form of an H, there are two flats on the each of the long (28m) walls connected by a narrow central service area where one finds the lifts and stairs and a disused drying room. The exterior concrete panels are faced with <a href="Flint%23As%20a%20building%20material">Norfolk flint</a>. The design is in the Scandinavian <a href="point%20block">point block</a> genre, as found on the <a href="Alton%20Estate">Alton Estate</a> rather than following a pure <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a> <a href="brutalism">brutalist</a> (concrete brut) genre. .
In front of the flats is a piazza, which forms the roof to a block of subterranean garages which in 2016 were unused. 

There are other low rise buildings on the estate constructed by the Larsen-Nielsen method.

History.
Ronan point collapse.
At Ronan point, a gas stove in an 18th-storey flat caused a series of floors to collapse on to each other. The official investigation said buildings built using the same method must be reinforced, or else have the gas supply removed. Southwark council who took over responsibility for the estate when the <a href="Greater%20London%20Council">Greater London Council</a> was disbanded by <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Thatcher government's</a> <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201985">Local Government Act 1985</a>, said they believed they had been strengthened.
Refurbishment.
A scheme is in place to convert the disused garages into a community and training centre with space for small workshops.
Grenfell Tower fire implications.
After the <a href="Grenfell%20Tower%20fire">Grenfell Tower fire</a> authorities across Great Britain performed additional fire safety checks on all social housing tower blocks. It a block like Skenfrith House, this concentrated on fire doors, evacuation procedures and compartmentalisation: could a fire in one flat be contained for one hour without breaching into an adjacent flat. During this process some residents complained of cracks in the concrete that would allow a piece of paper to pass to the flat above. Ove Arup, was then commissioned to conduct a structural report. The reported that the building had not been strengthened in the early seventies.

Southwark Council announced that strengthening work ordered after Ronan Point may not have been carried out. The gas supply to each block was severed until remedial work has been done. Residents remained in their flats but without, heating, hot water and cooking facilities.

Our Lady of the Rosary of Orani

The Image of Nuestra Señora del Rosario, la Virgen Milagrosa de Orani.
The Spanish Dominican friars arrived in the province of Bataan (then known as the Partido de Bataan and considered part of Pampanga) in 1587 and founded the parish of Abucay on June 10, 1588, placing it under the patronage of Sto. Domingo de Guzman, the founder of the Order of Preachers or the Dominican Order. As such, Abucay is considered to be the second oldest parish administered by the Dominicans in the Philippines, having been founded immediately after the establishment of the Dominican motherhouse of Sto. Domingo in Manila. The Dominican "frailes" brought with them the miraculous image of Nuestra Señora del Rosario, a custom followed by the Dominican Order in all of their new missions in keeping with their calling to promote the devotion to the Holy Rosary.

In 1596, the Dominican friars established the "visita" of Samal, under the parish of Abucay and transferred the image thereto. According to oral tradition, shortly after Samal was established as a Parish on April 20, 1644, the statue disappeared from its altar and was later found under a "camachile" tree near a creek, some 5 kilometers north of Samal. The people of Samal tried to return the image to their church but the same phenomenon occurred three times: the image returned to the same "camachile" tree where it had been found. The people interpreted this strange occurrence as a sign of God's will that the image should remain in Orani, so a small "visita" was built on that very spot.

Orani prospered as a town and its population subsequently increased. Alongside this development, the devotion to the Virgin of the Rosary grew so fast that at that time, she was already being called "la Virgen Milagrosa" or the Miraculous Virgin, due to her numerous miracles which drew thousands of pilgrims from nearby provinces such as Bulacan, Pampanga and Zamabales. This exponential growth eventually led to the establishment of Orani as an independent parish or Vicaría on April 21, 1714.

A life-sized image measuring one "estadio" or 1.68 cm, the image of the "Virgen Milagrosa" is a traditional Baroque rendition of the Mother and Child, in particular, that of our Lady of the Rosary. The statue is made out of wood, fully sculpted in the round, including the clothes, although she is dressed with real vestments donated by her devotees, following a tradition of vesting images of saints in Spain and the New World that continues to this day. The Virgin carries the Child Jesus with her left arm and, instead of the usual Rosary in the right arm, she holds a cane or walking stick ("bastón") as well as a scepter, while a Rosary hangs around her neck. The Christ Child holds a globe in His left hand while extending His right arm in a blessing. Rosaries hang from the necks of both Mother and Child following the way the Spanish Dominican missionaries wore the rosary and following a custom of the faithful in Spain and her colonies at the time, in order to gain special indulgences. She is garbed with a blue mantle that extends from her back and is tucked in her waist, and wears a white robe that was originally red but was repainted at a later date. A white veil covers her head in the manner of Jewish women at the time of Jesus.

Considering its large size, the image could be considered rare for that time. Some historians opine that it was intentionally made big to commemorate an important event or milestone, such as the founding of the Dominican mission in Bataan, the first outside Manila for the Dominicans. The size could also indicate that the image was meant to be enshrined at a church altar, hence its dimensions.

As to the origin of the image of the "Virgen Milagrosa", there are some theories which claim that the statue originated from Spain (on board the galleons that transported soldiers and the frailes from Spain to the New World). Nevertheless, considering the length and difficulty of the voyage from the Mother Country to the Philippines, as well as the precious space on board the galleons, bringing an image so large would simply have been impractical. Another theory states that it came from Mexico, just like the image of "La Naval de Manila", whose presence during the Dominicans missionaries' first voyage to the Philippines in 1587 was recorded by the frailes. The fact that the Orani image was not mentioned at all is highly indicative that it was not on the same journey. Claims that it came on a later journey, however, would clash with accounts by the Dominicans that it was brought to Bataan in 1587. Still, others claim that it was made in the Philippines, sometime between July 1587 and June 1588, just in time for the formal establishment of the Parish of Abucay. An analysis of the technique and rendition of the image's features may indicate a Philippine provenance. Elements such as the "suksok" (a carved and stylistic rendition of the mantle, tucked into the waist at the back) confirms this theory, aside from the features on the Virgin's face. Furthermore, at that time, there were already many able artisans (mostly Chinese) in Manila and its environs who could carve religious images after being taught by the religious orders that arrived first in the Philippines. The abundance of talented sculptors was noted by the Dominican Bishop of Manila (the first in the country), Domingo de Salazar, when he wrote King Philip II of Spain in 1590. Most of these artisans were Sangleys (Chinese) living in the Parián, an enclave of Manila also administered by the Dominicans.

On December 11, 1965, an article written by Oscar R. Landicho was published in the Chronicle magazine claiming that the "Virgen Milagrosa" was made by a "Greek" slave named Pere Morey in 1360. According to the article, Pere Morey was the father of Pere Oller and Pere Johan. To set the record straight, Pere Morey was not from Greece but was a subject of the Kingdom of Aragón (which would later become the Kingdom of Spain after its unification with the Kingdom of Castille in the 15th century). Morey was active in the island of Mallorca (then part of the Kingdom of Aragón) as a master mason (stonecutter)as well as an architect, and worked in the construction of various churches. Secondly, he was not related to Pere Oller and Pere Johan who were Gothic-style sculptors in the region of Catalunya. The writer may have been misled by the common name Pere (Pedro) which was not a surname or a family name but rather a first name. Pere Morey himself lived during the Gothic period of architecture and sculpture in Europe so to attribute to him a Baroque image like the "Virgen Milagrosa" of Orani would be something hard, if not impossible, to explain. Even in the remotest chance that the Virgen Milagrosa of Orani was made in 1360, it would be highly improbable that its devotees would have allowed the Dominican missionaries to take away to a distant land an image that would already have been more than 200 years old at that time (in the 1580s). Pere Morey is not to be confused with Pere Morey Servera, an award-winning Catalan writer born in 1941 and who is still active to this day.

Miracles of the Virgen Milagrosa.
In the Battles of La Naval de Manila from 1646 to 1647 against the Protestant Netherlands (that vied with Catholic Spain for colonial supremacy in the Orient), the Dutch invaders took Corregidor and plundered the coast of Bataan but Kapamgpangan and Orani natives under the protection of the Virgin of Orani defeated the Dutch forces who reached their shores. The Dutch marauders who succeeded in plundering Abucay, were also struck by a plague, and were forced to return to Batavia (modern-day Indonesia).

Even in the early years of the Dominicans in Bataan, the new converts already looked up to her as their “protector and guide” and “implored her with love and a lively faith in all their tribulations in life.” Many miracles were wrought through her intercession and were fortunately recorded by the Dominicans as a proof of her fame as a “miracle-worker.” One account speaks of the mysterious retreat of aggressive aetas who had sought to destroy the town, which was then a village of Samal. Pertinent investigations later showed that a heavenly Matron with a “stern countenance” appeared to the assaulting tribesmen and drove them off. The consensus was that this lady was the Virgin.

There is also the story of a locust plague in 1718 that, for some odd reason, spared only the province of Bataan. Despite the parish priest’s plea for the people to take measures against the plague, the only thing that the townspeople did was to pray at the Virgin’s shrine and their prayers were not in vain. A strong wind blew away the swarm of insects into the sea.

Also famous is the case of a judge from Manila, D. Gregorio de la Villa, who, being gravely ill, sought the Virgin’s help to cure the malady that left him almost totally paralyzed. Even before finishing the novena to the Virgen Milagrosa - he was already up and about and in the pink of health. Just as renowned is the case of a young boy from Bagbag (present-day Novaliches) who died. During his wake, his bereaved mother pleaded to the Virgen Milagrosa del Rosario and sought her maternal compassion. To the surprise of those present, the dead boy stood up and walked to his mother. In gratitude, both mother and child made a pilgrimage to Orani where they relayed what had happened to them to the Parish Priest who confirmed the authenticity of the miracle.

Also healed after praying the novena to the Virgen Milagrosa was a leper from Catanggalan (present-day Obando, Bulacan) whose healing over the nine days of the novena was witnessed by the Parish priest and by the faithful of Orani. The same Dominicans who recorded these miracles were wise to point out that as a result of these miracles, the devotion to the Virgin of Orani had enjoyed a “growing progression” and that “several volumes would be necessary to narrate the favors and that God has given though her.”

In return, the grateful people of Orani, would bring herbs and flowers to adorn her altar, as well as oil to fuel her lamp. The flowers and herbs and even the oil were later deemed miraculous by the people, just like the waters that sprung from the Virgin’s fountain, which was erected by the townspeople near the port, in her honor. The rich citizens of Orani and Samal, as well as some officials from as far away as Binondo, would donate jewels to her, as recorded in a 1750 inventory of her trousseau. On the other hand, the simple peasants of Orani would dance the “Jota de Orani” at the entrance of the church, as a token of gratitude for bountiful harvests. The shrine would also become the “most beautiful church in the province” and its reconstruction after the many fires and earthquakes that destroyed the building in the 19th and 20th century never lacked funds thanks to the piety and generosity of the people of Bataan and its neighboring provinces.

This piety and generosity was proven during the great fire of March 16, 1938, which destroyed three fourths of Orani. During the fire, the image was partially damaged but was not totally burned. It was later repaired in the "bahay kastila" owned by the Salaverria family (the matriarch, Filomena Pascual de Salaverria was the image's camarera) located just beside the church. The Blessed Sacrament also escaped the conflagration and was found miraculously intact after the fire. The church, despite the hardships the people of Orani endured, was rebuilt in a short time thanks to the people's devotion to their patroness.

During World War II, according to the accounts of Ms. Luling Casimiro, one of the seamstresses of the image, a Japanese soldier arrogantly aimed his gun at the statue, but scampered away in fright after the magazine of his gun melted and bent right before his very eyes.

When most of Luzon's seawaters were hit by the Red Tide in the 1990s, Orani's fishermen prayed to the Virgen Milagrosa for help, and Orani's fishing waters were mysteriously spared. To the surprise of the image's caretakers, the hemline of the Virgen's dress was found wet and muddied as though she had gone out to the coast to banish away the red tide.

After the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, citizens of Porac, Pampanga came to Orani during the town fiesta to give thanks, claiming that the Sto. Rosario of Orani had appeared to them in their dreams telling them to flee to higher grounds to escape the onslaught of lahar. At about the time the lahar had flowed, caretakers of the image found that the Virgen's "saya" was wet and soiled with lahar as if the Virgin had travelled to Pampanga to come to the aid of her devotees.

Veneration.
In recognition of the widespread devotion to the "Virgen Milagrosa" of Orani, Pope Pius XII approved on October 7, 1958 the <a href="Canonical%20Coronation">Canonical Coronation</a> of the image. The actual coronation would take place on April 18, 1959 in a solemn ceremony led by the Archbishop of San Fernando, Emilio Cinense, and the Papal Nuncio to the Philippines, Salvatore Sino.

In 1965, six years after the Canonical Coronation of the Virgen Milagrosa, Mr. Joaquin Mayoralgo, a native of Orani, approached then Parish Priest, Msgr. Emiliano Santos, claiming that he had the "original" image of the Virgen (i.e., the one that was brought by the Spaniards to Bataan) in his possession. When asked by Msgr. Santos how the image came into his possession, Mr. Mayoralgo claimed that he bought the image in an antique shop in Manila that had allegedly acquired it from an American G.I. who, in turn, supposedly found it floating in a river in Cavite in the 1940s. According to the claim, the G.I. was returning to the United States so he decided to get money to finance his trip by selling the image to the antique shop. Mr. Mayoralgo wanted the Monsignor to exchange the image he bought from the antique shop for the canonically crowned Image enshrined in the Parish Church, which he wanted to bring home. Msgr. Santos refused to surrender the image in Church to Mr. Mayoralgo, defending its antiquity and authenticity, but in order to appease Mr. Mayoralgo, allowed him to use this 1965 image as the official replica of the one enshrined at church. Mr. Mayoralgo decided to crown his image in 1965 (using the 1959 coronation regalia) and have a chapel built in the barrio of Silahis to enshrine his image, which he continued to claim as the original. He also had a novena (without the required Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur) printed and distributed, wherein he expressed the same claims. To date, the Diocese has not and does not recognize his claims while maintaining the authenticity of the Canonically Crowned Image in the Parish Church. The Diocese, however, allows the veneration of the image of Silahis in its chapel as an expression of the people's piety towards the Virgin.
On April 18, 1984, Cardinal <a href="Jaime%20Sin">Jaime Sin</a> led the celebrations for the 25th Anniversary of the Canonical Coronation. The 50th or Golden Anniversary of the Canonical Coronation was also celebrated with the presence of Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales in 2009.

The feast of the Virgen Milagrosa de Orani is celebrated by hundreds of thousands of devotees from all parts of Luzon, who flock to her shrine every second Sunday of October. At the shrine, the pilgrims pray the Rosary, hear Mass, receive Holy Communion and kiss the mantle of the Virgin at the back of the church. The town fiesta of Orani is considered by many as the most lively and joyous in Bataan, and even the whole of Central Luzon, due to the huge number of pilgrims who travel starting on the first day of the novena till the feast day itself. Throughout the town, marching bands can seen and heard, while stalls selling different products - from food to toys and clothing - line the plaza, the church area as well as main thoroughfares. On the feast day itself, Masses are celebrated every hour from 3:00 a.m. till 9:00 p.m. and all of these Masses are always brimming with people. Busloads of pilgrims from all over the country also visit her shrine throughout the year, usually on weekends. The Second Saturday of every month has been declared as the official pilgrimage day to Shrine. Devotees who fulfill the conditions of confession, communion and prayer for the Pope's intentions may gain a Plenary Indulgence on August 5, on the major feast days of the Virgin Mary or on a day of their choice once a year. This is in virtue of the Shrine's inscription as Spiritual Affiliate of the Archbasilica of St. Mary Major in Rome in September 2012.

The heart of the collective is a place called Wastement, a rehearsal space and a studio in which most of the collectives bands compose and record their albums. Members of the collective are active in various musical projects and bands, some of the best known include <a href="Dark%20Buddha%20Rising">Dark Buddha Rising</a>, <a href="Oranssi%20Pazuzu">Oranssi Pazuzu</a>. 

In 2016 Wastement conducted a Finnish Takeover at the <a href="Roadburn%20Festival">Roadburn Festival</a> with five of the collective's bands playing at the festival.This was aptly commented by Finnish music export association <a href="Music%20Finland">Music Finland</a>: "The festival has presented several local musical movements before, but five different bands from a basement located in a 3000 inhabitant neighborhood Nekala (in Tampere, Finland) must be a record of some kind."Another takeover took place in 2017 when <a href="Atomikyl%C3%A4">Atomikylä</a>, <a href="Mr.%20Peter%20Hayden">Mr. Peter Hayden</a> and <a href="Oranssi%20Pazuzu">Oranssi Pazuzu</a> performed at <a href="Roskilde%20Festival">Roskilde Festival</a>. Festival's booker Stefan Gejsing commented on the Festivals guide:"The metal scene in Finland is really buoyant at the moment. Some of the most interesting bands right now have grown out of the same rehearsal space, which they have dubbed Wastement. They are a collective, sharing members across bands. All bands have in common that they play metal, but they reference many other genres like space rock, ambient, prog, psych, doom and black. Collectively, they will make your head spin!"

Ford FK

The Ford FK, short for "Ford Köln," is a series of medium-duty trucks built by <a href="Ford%20Germany">Ford of Germany</a> in their <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> (Köln) plant in two generations from 1951 until 1961. The Ford "Köln" name replaced the earlier Rhein and Ruhr badges as competitor <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a> (Südwerke) had quietly copyrighted them. Ford Germany withdrew from the truck sector after 1961, focusing on lighter utility vehicles and imports from Ford UK.

First generation.
The first Ford FK series arrived in 1951, in three weight models: the FK 2000 with a 3.3 liter four-cylinder G28T petrol engine with ; the FK 3000 with a version of the same; and the FK 3500 with the G29T petrol V8 engine (this engine gained five horsepower in 1952). The FK's headlights were integrated in the fenders and the prominent grille consisted of seven horizontal chromed strips. The earlier, smaller Ford Rhein-series of trucks had been built with a petrol V8 engine, but as it was not very economical Ford decided to install a diesel engine. The choice fell on a unit from American engine manufacturer <a href="Hercules%20Engine%20Company">Hercules</a>; the engine was built under license for Ford by <a href="Knorr-Bremse">Knorr</a> in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> with a Bosch fuel injection system. This was installed in the Rhein series, but also in the FK 3500D and the FK 4000 which arrived in 1953. Reliability concerns prompted Ford to quickly detune the diesel to .
In 1953, the underpowered four-cylinder engines, carried over from the 1932 <a href="1932%20Ford%23BB">Ford BB</a> and developed from the 1927 <a href="Ford%20Model%20A%20%281927%E2%80%9331%29">Model A's</a> engine, were discontinued. In June 1954 the FK 4000 S/D arrived, this had a version of the Hercules diesel with . The comparatively high-revving, low-compression Hercules diesels had a very bad reputation for quality and served to hurt Ford's reputation in the truck market. At this time the Ford Köln also received a redesigned cabin, with a square, chromed grille, a split windshield, and a shorter bonnet. The shorter cab allowed for a longer cargo space with better weight distribution.

Second generation.
The second generation of Ford Kölns was introduced at the very end of 1955 and were nicknamed "Haifisch" ("Shark) due to their toothy grilles. The shape was much modern, with a one-piece, curved windshield, a rounded nose, and a grille with twelve vertical, chromed elements. The range included three main models: the FK 2500, the FK 3500, and the FK 4500. The FK has a ladder frame chassis with leaf sprung live axles front and rear and hydraulic brakes on all four wheels. Four- or five-speed transmissions were available. While petrol models retained the earlier 3.9-liter V8 with , the diesel engines were entirely new: they were <a href="Two-stroke%20diesel%20engine">two-stroke diesels</a> in either V4 or V6 formats, of 2.8 or 4.2 liters. Maximum power claims were , respectively.

The two-stroke design, developed by Professor <a href="Hans%20List">Hans List</a> of <a href="Graz">Graz</a>, Austria for <a href="Gr%C3%A4f%20%26amp%3B%20Stift">Gräf & Stift</a>, was chosen as it was believed that its minimum number of moving parts would provide both reliability and economy. However, reality proved otherwise. The cylinders deformed around the exhaust ports, and engine failures were rife. In the first half of 1956, warranty claims outnumbered new truck deliveries. Production of new engines was repeatedly halted in order to be able to carry out rebuilds. By the middle of 1957 the diesels were discontinued, leaving only the petrol V8 to soldier on until 1961. The disastrous experience is generally credited with ending Ford Germany's involvement with trucks. The pressing tools for the cabin were transferred to Ford UK in 1962, who used them for the <a href="Thames%20Trader">Thames Trader NC</a>, later sold as the Ford K-series.

History.
Punta Delgada was one of the first lighthouses to be completed as part of the original maritime lighting plan for the Canaries. Designed by the engineer by Juan de León y Castillo, building began in 1861 and it became operational in 1865.

Built in a <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neo-classical</a> style similar to other Canarian 19th century lighthouses, it consists of a white washed single storey building with dark volcanic rock used for the masonry detailing, located on a headland at the eastern end of Alegranza The light is displayed from a lantern room at the top of a masonry tower, attached to the seaward side of the main building.

The lighthouse was designed to accommodate the two keepers and their families, and has a central courtyard or patio. In the centre of the courtyard is a cistern that collects the rainfall from the roof of the buildings. This was insufficient to cater to the two families due to the low frequency of rainfall on the island, so a well was also built 20 meters from the lighthouse to collect and store water from the mountain.

Both the keeper’s house and the tower are part of the architectural heritage of the Canary Islands and were declared a monument of cultural interest <a href="Bien%20de%20Inter%C3%A9s%20Cultural">Bien de Interés Cultural</a> in 2002 and included in the <a href="List%20of%20Bienes%20de%20Inter%C3%A9s%20Cultural%20in%20the%20Province%20of%20Las%20Palmas%23T">listing for Las Palmas</a>.

Parrish, from <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Virginia">Bowling Green, Virginia</a>, and Aggie Cooper, from <a href="Camden%2C%20South%20Carolina">Camden, South Carolina</a>. They had another sister Isabel C. Parrish who would marry Morgan T. McCormick.

In 1902 Dinks Parrish was in business with J. Arthur Anderson, owner of the J. Arthur Anderson Laundry (currently a St. Louis Landmark Beaux Arts building at 4940 Washington Boulevard). Parrish worked in the men’s clothing business before starting his own laundry in 1892. His other interests were horse and dog shows and he belonged to the Missouri Athletic Club. After the partnership with Anderson ended, Parrish opened his own business "Dinks Parrish Laundry" in 1916, again currently a St. Louis Historical Landmark and a <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20listings%20in%20St.%20Louis%20north%20and%20west%20of%20downtown">NRHP listing in St. Louis</a>, a Late Gothic Revival-style building at 3120 Olive Street with a blue-and-white terra-cotta facade. The building was designed by architect Will Levy, prominent St. Louis architect, who designed a number of Central West End buildings, including the Mahler Ballroom and the first Jewish Hospital Building on Delmar.

Career.
Will Parrish ran, together with Grace Parrish, a photography studio in St. Louis, at 5607 Cabanne Place. She was also a poet and painter. She was widely published as a photographer in specialized journals. Will Parrish used a special stained window-glass effect in her magazine illustrations.

The Parrish Sisters started their career in 1904 after attending the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition">St. Louis World's Fair</a>: the first work were a set of photographs by Will Parrish of the nine muses, with Grace Parrish posing for each of them in Greek dress.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch touted that the Parrish Sisters were "two of the cleverest young amateurs" and their work "equals work done by professional photographers of many years' experience".

They faced also rejection; in a letter of 1917 from <a href="Alfred%20Stieglitz">Alfred Stieglitz</a> to Will Parrish, rejecting some of her photographs for his gallery: "The Little Gallery is not devoted entirely to the ultra modern in painting and sculpture. It is devoted to ideas. To the development of such. And I feel that your work, good as it is, is primarily picture making. That is not adding to the idea of photography, nor to the idea of expression. And for that reason it would be out of place in the Little Gallery."

In 1930 the Parrish sisters spent time in Europe together, and later Will Parrish went to Italy alone.

Personal life.
Will Parrish played a major role in <a href="Sara%20Teasdale">Sara Teasdale</a>'s life, helping her organize the poems for her first collection. They met in 1903 and Teasdale was among the initial members of "The Potters".

Will Parrish died on January 3, 1941, and is buried with her parents and sister at <a href="Bellefontaine%20Cemetery">Bellefontaine Cemetery</a>, St. Louis, Plot: Block 52-53 lot 6001. Grace Parrish died on March 9, 1954.

Wage union

The Wage Union is a <a href="European%20Citizens%27%20Initiative">European Citizens’ Initiative</a> launched by Central European political parties, trade unions and private individuals, aiming to eliminate the economic and wage inequalities between the EU’s western and eastern (<a href="Member%20state%20of%20the%20European%20Union">those joined after 2004</a>) member states.

The history of the Wage Union initiative.
At a <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> conference organized by <a href="Jobbik">Jobbik Movement for a Better Hungary</a> on 14th March 2017, the representatives of eight central European countries formed the Citizens’ Committee for the initiative, thus officially launching the project. Hungary’s <a href="M%C3%A1rton%20Gy%C3%B6ngy%C3%B6si">Márton Gyöngyösi</a> as elected as he representative of the Citizens’ Committee while <a href="Jaak%20Madison">Jaak Madison</a> of Estonia was entrusted as thesubstitute representative.

On 16th May 2017, the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> registered and approved of the initiative. 

The objectives of the initiative.
The initiative aims to call public attention to the economic and wage gaps between the western and the eastern member states of the European Union as well as the elimination thereof. The initiators’ goal is to lay out the principle of “equal wages for equal work” in the EU Treaties as a fundamental right for citizens. They consider it as an essential condition for integration. “Ever since 2004, the EU's eastern enlargement has failed to enable Eastern Central European member states to catch up with their western counterparts. The enormous gap between the wages is a grave injustice that drives valuable labour force to the west and thus puts the eastern region into an unmanageable situation. The only way to remedy this discrepancy is to ensure that the European community sets the elimination of wage inequalities as its fundamental principle which is then implemented in the foreseeable future. However, neither member state leaders nor EU institutions have decided to champion this cause. It is time that the disadvantaged member states, with the support of their citizens, put this issue on the agenda of European political discourse. We can assuredly say that the proposal is of historic significance. “ – quote from the official website of the initiative.

Criticism.
Critics of the Wage Union initiative have said that wage inequalities cannot be eliminated as the reasons for the low wages in eastern member states are rooted in underlying economic factors such as lower productivity. The initiators have admitted that the accomplishment of a Wage Union is a long process which requires a systemic transformation of Central European economies, an increased productivity and the output of products with higher added value but no such intentions have even been demonstrated in the region so far. Another oft-quoted argument against the Wage Union is that western member states are not interested in its implementation. However, the backers of the project point out that the massive emigration of Central Europeans to the west leads to social tensions and upsets the stability of the European Union, which western European leaders have also begun to realize. The solution may lie in the reduction of the gap in living standards. According to certain critics of the Wage Union concept, the European Union has no institutional means to eliminate wage inequalities but the participants of the initiative claim that the first step should be to lay out the principle itself, which could then be followed by creating the institutional conditions but the problem has not even been raised so far.

Dan Perri

Dan Perri is a film and television <a href="title%20sequence">title sequence</a> designer. He has worked in <a href="film%20title%20design">film title design</a> since the 1970s, and has been responsible for the main titles of a number of notable films including "<a href="The%20Exorcist">The Exorcist</a>" (1973), "<a href="Taxi%20Driver">Taxi Driver</a>" (1976), "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" (1977), "<a href="Raging%20Bull">Raging Bull</a>" (1980), and "<a href="Airplane%21">Airplane!</a>" (1980).

Early life.
Dan Perri was born in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> in 1945. In 1949 his family moved to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to be close to his father's parents, but his mother was unhappy there. Over the next few years Perri's fmaily moved back and forth between LA and New York. Eventually his parents divorced and the young Dan stayed with his mother, who was an artist and encouraged his talent. At the age of twelve Perri set up a small <a href="sign%20painting">sign painting</a> business on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, selling signage to local stores, markets bars and restaurants.

At school, Perri's talents were fostered by his art teacher, Barbara Brooks, a former <a href="Madison%20Avenue">Madison Avenue</a> <a href="advertising%20agency">advertising agency</a> <a href="art%20director">art director</a> who had moved into teaching. She encouraged him to read books, design manuals, and various <a href="advertising%20industry">advertising industry</a> publications such as <a href="Graphis%20Inc.">Graphis publications</a> and <a href="Communication%20Arts%20%28magazine%29">"Communication Arts" magazine</a>. After leaving school in 1963, Perri served a short apprenticeship at Hixson & Jorgensen, an advertising agency on <a href="Wilshire%20Boulevard">Wilshire Boulevard</a> in LA. Around 1964 he went to study at the <a href="Art%20Center%20College%20of%20Design">Art Center College of Design</a> in <a href="Pasadena">Pasadena</a> for a year and a half, before dropping out and going to a local college. Around this time, he started to design graphics for local businesses and <a href="album%20cover">album cover</a>s for small record companies.

Career.
Perri made contact with the film graphics designer <a href="Saul%20Bass">Saul Bass</a> and began to pester him for work at his studio on <a href="Sunset%20Boulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a>. Eventually Perri found work with Bass through his illustrator, Art Goodman.During his service in the <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a>, Perri served on the "<a href="USS%20Repose%20%28AH-16%29">USS Repose</a>" and designed an on-board newspaper, entitled "The Repose Reprise".

After serving in the navy, Perri went to work with Cinefx alongside Phill Norman, <a href="Wayne%20Fitzgerald">Wayne Fitzgerald</a> Don Record, and a former school friend, Steve Smith. After a year, both Perri and Smith quit and went on to form their own independent design studio, Perri & Smith. The pair worked together from 1969 to 1973, mostly on small, low-budget television features, but their credits also included films such as "<a href="Electra%20Glide%20in%20Blue">Electra Glide in Blue</a>" and a number of <a href="Gene%20Corman">Gene Corman</a>'s <a href="blaxploitation">blaxploitation</a> films. The designers were often expolited and clients sometimes failed to pay, and eventuallly the business folded.

"The Exorcist" and "Taxi Driver".
Perri's big break came in 1973 when he was commissioned by <a href="William%20Friedkin">Billy Friedkin</a> to produced the main titles for "<a href="The%20Exorcist%20%28film%29">The Exorcist</a>", his first solo project. With a <a href="blockbuster%20film">blockbuster film</a> in his portfolio, Perri was now able to attract more work, and soon found himself working on high-profile titles. For "<a href="Nashville%20%28film%29">Nashville</a>" (1975), <a href="Robert%20Altman">Robert Altman</a> commissioned a main title sequence and a logo to be used in marketing. Perri produced an unusual, <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a>y sequence inspired by low-budget <a href="K-Tel%20Records">K-Tel Records</a> <a href="television%20commercial">television commercial</a>s, complete with a loud, brash voiceover by <a href="Johnny%20Grant%20%28radio%20personality%29">Johnny Grant</a>.

In 1976, <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> brought Perri in to design the titles for "<a href="Taxi%20Driver">Taxi Driver</a>". Perri took <a href="Second%20unit%20filming">second unit</a> footage and colour-treated the film through a process of film copying and <a href="slit-scan">slit-scan</a>, resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the "underbelly" of New York City through lurid colours, glowing <a href="neon%20sign">neon sign</a>s distorted nocturnal images and deep <a href="black%20level">black level</a>s, accompanied by <a href="Bernard%20Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>'s <a href="jazz">jazz</a> soundtrack.

"Close Encounters".
Early in the production of "<a href="Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>" (1977), <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> hired Perri to design a logo for the film. With only a script to work from, Perri produced a logotype in <a href="Handel%20Gothic">Handel Gothic</a> typeface. Spielberg was delighted with the result, and applied the logo to all production stationery and crew shirts. Unusually in filmmaking, Spielberg carried enough influence to maintain creative control over the film's branding, and asked Perri to design the entire advertising campaign for "Close Encounters" based on his logo.

"Star Wars".
Possibly Perri's best-known title sequence project came about in 1976 when his friend <a href="James%20Nelson%20%28sound%20editor%29">James Nelson</a> was working on <a href="post-production">post-production</a> for a new space fantasy film, "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>". Nelson recommended Perri to director George Lucas, who invited Perri to <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a>, Lucasfilm's post-production operation at <a href="Van%20Nuys">Van Nuys</a>, California. Lucas briefed Perri to take inspiration from old 1930s cinema serials such as "<a href="Flash%20Gordon">Flash Gordon</a>" and "<a href="Buck%20Rogers">Buck Rogers</a>" that had inspired Lucas to write much of his "Star Wars" story. After struggling to come up with a concept that Lucas liked, Perri eventually developed a concept for presenting a textual introduction based on the opening credits of the 1939 <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> film, "<a href="Union%20Pacific%20%28film%29">Union Pacific</a>", in which the credits are shown distorted by a sharp perspective and rolling along a <a href="Track%20%28rail%20transport%29">railroad track</a> towards a distant <a href="vanishing%20point">vanishing point</a>. Lucas approved of the idea and Perri produced sketches and prototype mechanical artwork, supported by <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a> artwork drawn by the production artist <a href="Alex%20Tavoularis">Alex Tavoularis</a>. This gave birth to the now-familiar <a href="Star%20Wars%20opening%20crawl">opening crawl</a> sequence that appears in the "Star Wars" films.
Perri also designed a <a href="logotype">logotype</a>, consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point to follow the same perspective as the opening crawl. Lucas eventually rejected Perri's logo due to readability problems, turning instead to the graphic designer <a href="Suzy%20Rice">Suzy Rice</a>, an art director at <a href="Seiniger%20Advertising">Seiniger Advertising</a>, who designed the flat "Star Wars" logo that was inserted into the final cut of the film. While Perri's skewed logo did not appear on-screen, it was used widely on pre-release print advertising, and it featured prominently on <a href="film%20poster">film poster</a>s promoting the release of "Star Wars" on cinema billboards in 1977 (notably <a href="Tom%20Jung">Tom Jung</a>'s "", the by the <a href="Brothers%20Hildebrandt">Brothers Hildebrandt</a> and <a href="Tom%20Chantrell">Tom Chantrell</a>'s ).

Perri has stated that Lucas offered him a share of royalties from the film in lieu of his ordinary fee; Perri rejected the offer and has since regretted his choice.

Later work.
Perri worked for Scorsese again in 1980, designing a title sequence for "<a href="Raging%20Bull">Raging Bull</a>". This featured a strong red logotype which emphasised the maniacal quality of the lead character, introducing a film that was shot in <a href="black%20and%20white">black and white</a>. This caused technical problems when the film distributor <a href="Film%20splicer">splice</a>d together <a href="Color%20motion%20picture%20film">colour</a> <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a> for the title and monochrome stock for the rest of the picture.

Perri's subsequent credits have included "<a href="The%20Fan%20%281981%20film%29">The Fan</a>" (1981), "<a href="The%20Equalizer%20%28TV%20series%29">The Equalizer</a>" (1985), "<a href="The%20Player%20%28film%29">The Player</a>" (1992). More recently, he designed the titles for "<a href="Gangs%20of%20New%20York">Gangs of New York</a>" (2002) and "<a href="The%20Beaver%20%28film%29">The Beaver</a>" (2011).

Simon was born into the influential <a href="Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi%20family">Szécsényi family</a> as one of the three sons of <a href="K%C3%B3nya%20Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi">Kónya Szécsényi</a>, <a href="Ban%20of%20Croatia">Ban of Croatia</a> and Elizabeth Haschendorfer, a daughter of Austrian noble Wulfing Haschendorfer from Haschendorf/Hasfalva (today part of <a href="Neckenmarkt">Neckenmarkt</a> in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>). His brothers were <a href="Frank%20Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi">Frank</a>, also a baron and his strongest ally at political level, and Nicholas I, who was last mentioned in 1383. The Szécsényi family originated from the <a href="Kacsics">Kacsics</a> clan. Simon's grandfather was <a href="Thomas%20Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi">Thomas I Szécsényi</a>, who rose to prominence during King <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Hungary">Charles I</a>'s war against the <a href="Oligarch%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%29">oligarchs</a> and received numerous land donations thereafter.

Indicating the social status of his family, Simon Szécsényi married Elizabeth Garai, the daughter of <a href="Nicholas%20I%20Garai">Nicholas I Garai</a>, <a href="Palatine%20of%20Hungary">Palatine of Hungary</a>, who was one of the leading magnates of King <a href="Louis%20I%20of%20Hungary">Louis I of Hungary</a>, then <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Hungary">Mary, Queen of Hungary</a>. Through the marriage, Simon became relative to numerous baronial families, and even Sigismund himself. Simon and Elizabeth had three children. The eldest one was <a href="Nicholas%20Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi">Nicholas II</a>, who lost all of his fortune after a conspiracy and show trial against him, and died in exile in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a>. The second son Thomas II was mentioned only once in 1407. Their only daughter Dorothea married <a href="Sigismund%20Losonci">Sigismund Losonci</a>, who governed the <a href="Banate%20of%20Severin">Banate of Severin</a> with the titles of captain of several castles in 1420. Simon's branch became extinct after a generation.

Career.
He first appeared in contemporary documents in 1373. The Szécsényi brothers were one of the earliest domestic partisans of Sigismund of Luxembourg, who arrived to Hungary to validate the marriage agreement with Queen Mary. After the coronation of Sigismund as co-ruler in March 1387, the Széchenyis belonged to the most influential barons after the king's foreign-origin courtiers. In 1388, Simon bought the royal castle of Salgó (<a href="B%C3%B6rzs%C3%B6ny">Börzsöny</a>) in <a href="Hont%20County">Hont County</a> and its surrounding eight villages from Sigismund. In the same time, he was appointed "<a href="isp%C3%A1n">ispán</a>" of Hont (along with his brother Frank) and <a href="Trencs%C3%A9n%20County">Trencsén</a> Counties, holding both positions simultaneously until 1390. In 1389, Frank and Simon Szécsényi participated in the military campaign to <a href="Moravian%20Serbia">Serbia</a>, which took place after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kosovo">Battle of Kosovo</a>. Both of them had been involved in the successful sieges of <a href="Bora%C4%8D%20Fortress">Borač</a> and Čestin forts.

In order to counterbalance <a href="Voivode%20of%20Transylvania">Voivode</a> <a href="Ladislaus%20I%20Losonci">Ladislaus Losonci</a>'s power and influence in <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, who turned against Sigismund and supported <a href="Ladislaus%20of%20Naples">Ladislaus of Naples</a>'s claim to the Hungarian throne, Sigismund appointed Simon Szécsényi as <a href="Count%20of%20the%20Sz%C3%A9kelys">Count of the Székelys</a> around May 1390, ending the <a href="House%20of%20Drago%C8%99">Bélteki brothers</a>' continuous rule since 1387. At the same time, he also became "ispán" of <a href="Bihar%20County">Bihar County</a>. In official documents, Szécsényi first appeared as count on 27 February 1391, when issued a diploma in <a href="Alba%20Iulia">Gyulafehérvár</a> (today Alba Iulia, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>). He urged the <a href="Sz%C3%A9kelys">Székely</a> noble elite of <a href="Marossz%C3%A9k">Marosszék</a> seat to pay the "ispán"'s remuneration. However Szécsényi held the dignity for less than a year. On 28 March 1391, Sigismund informed his subjects in <a href="Gurghiu%2C%20Mure%C8%99">Görgény Castle</a> (today Gurghiu in Romania) that he dismissed Szécsényi as Count of the Székelys and appointed <a href="Stephen%20Kanizsai">Stephen Kanizsai</a> to replace him, "while maintaining all his fondness" for Szécsényi. This was one of the chapters of the Kanizsais' expansion, who dominated the royal court since Sigismund's coronation under the leadership of <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Esztergom">Archbishop</a> <a href="John%20Kanizsai">John Kanizsai</a>. Under such circumstances, Szécsényi joined the allegiance of the <a href="Lackfi%20family">Lackfi family</a> which gradually lost influence after the death of Louis I in 1382. Nevertheless, Szécsényi did not hold any dignity for the next four years.

Szécsényi gradually became a partisan of the Kanizsai League after that. For this reason, he successfully managed to become <a href="Judge%20royal">Judge royal</a> in May 1395. As Sigismund prepared a war against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and its allies <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a> and <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a> since that year, which sparked into the so-called <a href="Battle%20of%20Nicopolis">Crusade of Nicopolis</a>, he was far away from the royal court for a long time. Thus Szécsényi acted as Judge royal in accordance with the will of barons and prelates, who were gradually confronted with Sigismund and his policy. On 17 November in that year, he was replaced by <a href="John%20P%C3%A1szt%C3%B3i">John Pásztói</a>. After the disastrous defeat at <a href="Nicopolis">Nicopolis</a>, Szécsényi took an active in role in assassination of his former ally, the once powerful <a href="Stephen%20II%20Lackfi">Stephen Lackfi</a>, who was massacred by the followers of the Kanizsai League along with his kinship in the <a href="Bloody%20Sabor%20of%20Kri%C5%BEevci">Bloody Sabor of Križevci</a> on 27 February 1397.

In the upcoming years, the relationship increasingly worsened between the Hungarian barons ("de facto" led by Archbishop Kanizsai) and Sigismund, especially due to the latter's favoritism towards his foreign courtiers, such as <a href="Pippo%20Spano">Pipo of Ozora</a>, <a href="Stibor%20of%20Stiboricz">Stibor of Stiboricz</a>, <a href="Hermann%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Celje">Hermann II, Count of Celje</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Zagreb">Bishop</a> <a href="Eberhard%20Albeni">Eberhard Albeni</a>. In 1401, Szécsényi participated in the magnate conspiracy against Sigismund. On 28 April, he led an armed group to the <a href="Buda%20Castle">royal castle</a> and demanded the "expulsion of Bohemians, Poles and other foreign courtiers". Sigismund refused that, thus he was captured and imprisoned in <a href="Visegr%C3%A1d%20Castle">Visegrád</a>, then <a href="Sikl%C3%B3s%20Castle">Siklós</a>. John Kanizsai as lord chancellor of the realm ("corona regni") and the royal council took over the royal powers. The council appointed Szécsényi as Voivode of Transylvania, depriving Stibor of his office. The <a href="Garai%20family">Garai family</a> who kept the king under custody in Siklós, concluded a separate peace treaty with Sigismund, who was set free on 29 October 1401. The Kanizsais' victory proved to be "<a href="Pyrrhic%20victory">pyrrhic</a>" and gradually lost is influence at the court. Szécsenyi, however, was able to retain his ascendancy due to his family relationship with the Garais through his marriage. The Siklós League, led by <a href="Nicholas%20II%20Garai">Nicholas II Garai</a> (Szécsényi's brother-in-law) and Hermann of Celje, took the power over the royal court after the 1401 conspiracy. Szécsényi was standing by the king in 1403, when another baronial revolt broke out in favour of Ladislaus of Naples.

For his participation in the counterinsurgency, Szécsényi was made <a href="Master%20of%20the%20doorkeepers">Master of the doorkeepers</a> (thus also Marshal of the Royal Court), holding the office from 1403 to 1409 (there was a short interruption between July 1405 and January 1406, for unknown reasons). Beside that he was also "ispán" of <a href="S%C3%A1ros%20County">Sáros</a> (1403–1405), <a href="Szepes%20County">Szepes</a> (1404), <a href="Borsod%20County">Borsod</a> (1404–1405) and <a href="Heves%20County%20%28former%29">Heves</a> (1405) Counties. Szécsényi was among the original founding members of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Dragon">Order of the Dragon</a> in 1408. His brother Frank died in that year, thus Simon remained the sole head of the family. Feeling the nearness of his death, he concluded an inheritance contract with his nephew Ladislaus (II) in the presence of Judge royal <a href="Simon%20Rozgonyi">Simon Rozgonyi</a> on 9 December 1411 in <a href="Letk%C3%A9s">Letkés</a>. Accordingly, his son Nicholas would be the sole heir of Salgó Castle, which was acquired by Simon decades earlier, while <a href="Topo%C4%BE%C4%8Dany">Tapolcsány</a> (today Topoľčany, <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>) belonged to Frank's branch. <a href="Holl%C3%B3k%C5%91">Hollókő</a> and <a href="Hajn%C3%A1%C4%8Dka">Ajnácskő</a> (today Hajnáčka, Slovakia) were classified to Ladislaus (Frank's son) and Nicholas (Simon's son), respectively, while those accessaries (villages and lands) were shared between the two branches. The remaining two castles (Somoskő and Bene) and the surrounding villages became a joint family property, while both branched had to appoint an own castellan, simultaneously. According to a charter dated 29 January 1412, Simon Szécsényi died in the days.

It's Raining (Irma Thomas song)

"It's Raining" is a <a href="Soul%20music">soul</a>/<a href="Rhythm%20%26amp%3B%20blues">R&B</a> ballad, credited as written by <a href="Allen%20Toussaint">Naomi Neville</a>. It was first <a href="sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction">recorded</a> in November 1961 by <a href="Irma%20Thomas">Irma Thomas</a>, and produced by <a href="Allen%20Toussaint">Allen Toussaint</a>. The song has emotional ties to <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, having been written and sung by people born in that State, being released on a <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>–based record label and enduring in the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a> as a regional classic.

"It's Raining", alongside "Ruler of My Heart" and "I Done Got Over It", remain some of Thomas' best–known recordings.

History.
Initially Thomas recorded for <a href="Ric%20Records">Ron Records</a> but, in 1961, she left for <a href="Minit%20Records">Minit Records</a>, feeling that her original label did not pay her due royalties. This move paired her with <a href="Allen%20Toussaint">Allen Toussaint</a>, who both wrote and produced most of her work with Minit. As well as "It's Raining", Thomas recorded other notable tracks such as "<a href="Time%20Is%20on%20My%20Side">Time Is on My Side</a>" and "Ruler of My Heart." The name "Naomi Neville" was simply a pseudonym used by Toussaint, on many of his early compositions. Although most of her 1961–63 Minit recordings were written and produced by Toussaint, only one of these, "Two Winters Long", made the national charts. It spent three weeks on the "<a href="Cashbox%20%28magazine%29">Cashbox</a>" R&B chart in February 1963, peaking at no. 43. Her version of "<a href="It%27s%20Too%20Soon%20to%20Know">It's Too Soon to Know</a>" (Minit 633) was another that failed to chart, however all sold well regionally.

The origins of the song came when Thomas visited Allen Toussaint's parents' house in New Orleans. Sat at the piano Toussaint composed many of his early songs. Toussaint later stated "I remember when I was writing 'It's Raining,' she was sitting right there, and it began raining outside," he said. "I just wrote that song then and handed it over to her and sung a little bit of it, just to show her the melody, and it fit like a gown." Toussaint captured solitude that remains possible in a depths of a rain sodden night.

The opening falsetto harmonies captured the drip-drop of rain and tears by using a late 1950s <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a> singing style. That it became a regional favorite is summed up by one journalist who noted that "Maybe it's because although it speaks to a universal sentimental human experience - romantic heartbreak - it does so with dignity, rather than pour on the sap." Nevetheless, "It's Raining" did not reach any national chart.

"It's Raining" was used in the 1986 independent film by <a href="Jim%20Jarmusch">Jim Jarmusch</a>, "<a href="Down%20by%20Law%20%28film%29">Down By Law</a>". The film's actors <a href="Roberto%20Benigni">Roberto Benigni</a> and <a href="Nicoletta%20Braschi">Nicoletta Braschi</a>, whose characters fall in love in the movie, danced to the song.

The song later appeared on the Thomas albums "Soul Queen Of New Orleans" (1978) and "Live! Simply The Best" (1991).

Cover versions.
The song has been <a href="cover%20version">covered</a> by a number of musicians over the years, most notably including the following:

He was born in <a href="Moudon">Moudon</a> and came to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> in 1769, to study under Nicolas-Henri-Joseph de Fassin. He subsequently left for Italy, and established himself in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> at the end of 1776. In March 1778, he was employed by two Dutch noblemen to accompany them on a four-month voyage to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Kingdom of the Two Sicilies</a> and <a href="Malta">Malta</a> where he created close to three hundred watercolours (held currently by the <a href="Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam).

He stayed in Rome from 1777 to 1793 as a landscape painter. In collaboration with the engraver <a href="Giovanni%20Volpato">Giovanni Volpato</a>, he published in 1780 twenty-four engravings depicting views of Rome and its surroundings. In 1782, he received a commission from <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Paul%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Paul Alexandrovitch of Russia</a> for two paintings and, in 1782, a commission from <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VI">Pope Pius VI</a>. In 1784, <a href="Gustav%20III%20of%20Sweden">Gustav III of Sweden</a> was his largest purchaser. But his primary commissioners were still English noblemen on the <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> of Europe, for example <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Hoare%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Sir Richard Colt Hoare</a>, Milford Hervey, and Lord Breadalbane.

The unrest arising from the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> led to the expulsion of many French from the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a>. Ducros, considered a <a href="Jacobin">Jacobin</a>, was expelled in 1793; he subsequently settled in <a href="Abruzzo">Abruzzo</a>, then in <a href="Naples">Naples</a> until 1799, where he created numerous works depicting <a href="Campania">Campania</a> and <a href="Mount%20Etna">Mount Etna</a>. He sold some of his works to <a href="William%20Hamilton%20%28diplomat%29">William Hamilton</a> and some seascapes to <a href="John%20Dalberg-Acton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Acton">Lord Acton</a>. Ducros came again to <a href="Malta">Malta</a> in 1800, and here painted views of <a href="Valletta">Valletta</a> for the General <a href="Thomas%20Graham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lynedoch">Thomas Graham</a>, who had recently conquered the island.

Ducros returned to <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> in the summer of 1807, first of all to <a href="Nyon">Nyon</a>, then to <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>. In <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> he was named an honourary member of the Society of Arts in 1807. In <a href="Bern">Bern</a>, he was named professor of painting at the Academy in 1809, but died, in <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>, before being able to assume the post, on 18 February 1810.

The landscapes of Ducros are for the most part kept at the <a href="Cantonal%20Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts</a> in Lausanne and in the English estates <a href="Stourhead">Stourhead</a> and <a href="Bramall%20Hall">Bramall Hall</a>.

Work.
Ducros is notable among watercolourists of his time for his large canvases, limited palette and forceful tones (achieved through application of gum) which allowed his paintings to be hung alongside oils at exhibitions. Ducros sold some of his paintings, including several to <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Hoare%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Sir Richard Colt Hoare</a>, at whose estate of Stourhead they are still kept. However, he retained the majority of his paintings to use as the basis for engravings, which he sold to '<a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a>' travellers.

Mistress Forrest

Mistress Forrest (Margaret Foxe) and her maid servant Anne Burras, were the first two women to come to the Virginia Colony, arriving on October 1, 1608 in what is known as the Second Supply, aboard the English ship the Mary and Margaret (or Mary-Margaret, both names appear in the records) under Captain Christopher Newport to resupply the colony at Jamestown, Virginia. Her husband <a href="Thomas%20Forrest%20%28colonist%29">Thomas Forrest (colonist)</a> Esq. was listed as a gentleman on that ship as shown on its manifest, whereas she was listed only as Mistress Forrest. Thomas and Margaret had married on August 16, 1605, in St. Giles in the Fields, London, England.
Excavation at Jamestown.
Remains unearthed at Jamestown in 1997 may be those of Mistress Forrest.

Thomas and Mistress Forrest in a painting, Baptism of Pocahontas, in the Rotunda of the US Capital Building.
In February 1837, <a href="John%20Gadsby%20Chapman">John Gadsby Chapman</a> received a commission from the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> to paint a historical scene for the rotunda of the Capitol building. For this work, Chapman received a total payment of $10,000. On November 30, 1840, "The Baptism of Pocahontas" was formally unveiled in the Capitol rotunda. Prominently featured in the painting, according to a "key" from the Granger Collection, New York City <a href="http%3A//www.granger.com/results.asp%3Fimage%3D0079778%26amp%3Bitemw%3D4%26amp%3Bitemf%3D0002%26amp%3Bitemstep%3D1%26amp%3Bitemx%3D53"></a> is ""11. Mr. and Mrs. Forrest, the lady being the first gentlewoman to arrive in the colony"", and the painting itself shows a man, woman and young child, presumably their son (although there is no record of Margaret and Thomas having any children, while there is a record of Thomas having a son, Peter born in 1601). This key is referenced "At Jamestown VA 1613". It is unlikely this historic painting done over two centuries later reflects the actual history: The Smithsonian's JR156 excavation of the female skeleton suggests it was the remains of Mistress Forrest who "may have died soon after her arrival in Jamestown" in 1608, thus would not have been not alive to witness a 1613 baptism. Further, the child born in 1601 would not be a toddler 12 years later. Never-the-less, the painting firmly places Thomas Forrest, and perhaps his son Peter, in the rotunda of American History as art, if not fact.

Jarmo Lindberg

Jarmo Ilmari Lindberg (born 10 June 1959) is a Finnish general and the current <a href="Chief%20of%20Defence%20%28Finland%29">Chief of Defence</a> since 2014. Lindberg began his career as a fighter pilot, and was eventually promoted to Commander of the Finnish Air Force (in 2008) and then Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics and Armaments in the Defence Command (in 2012).

Career.
Lindberg graduated from the Kuusaa gymnasium in <a href="Kouvola">Kouvola</a> in 1978 and completed his mandatory military service in <a href="Training%20Air%20Wing%2C%20Finnish%20Air%20Force">Training Air Wing, Finnish Air Force</a> in <a href="Kauhava">Kauhava</a>, and was active as a hobby pilot. In the 1970s he receive the nickname "Charles" Lindberg, after the famous aviator <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a>. He maintains an active Twitter account by that name.

In 1979, Lindberg enrolled in the flight cadet course and graduated in 1982, receiving a promotion to "luutnantti" (Lieutenant). He flew as an officer pilot, instructor and demo pilot in Karelia Air Command in 1982–87, flying Soviet <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-21">MiG–21BIS 1988</a> fighter planes, and was promoted to flight commander in 1989. In 1993–94, Lindberg was the Chief of Pilot Training in the Finnish Air Force headquarters in Tikkakoski, <a href="Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4">Jyväskylä</a>. In 1995, American <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a>s were purchased to become the frontline fighter jets for the Finnish Air Force, replacing Saab Drakens and MiGs. Lindberg attended a seven-month US Navy F/A–18 Hornet training course in <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Lemoore">Naval Air Station Lemoore</a>, California, and participated in the acquisition, introduction and maintenance of the Hornets. In 1995–1999 Lindberg was the Commander of Fighter Squadron 21 in <a href="Satakunta%20Air%20Command">Satakunta Air Command</a>. In 1999 Lindberg was promoted to the Air Force Command, working as a Deputy Chief of Staff Air Force Operations and Chief of Plans and Ops (A5/A3). After working as Assistant Chief of Finnish Defence Staff (Ops Division) in the Defence Command in Helsinki, he again served as a Commander in <a href="Lapland%20Air%20Command">Lapland Air Command</a>, <a href="Rovaniemi">Rovaniemi</a> in 2005.

In 2005, he received promotion to Brigadier General, and worked as the Deputy Chief of Operations in 2005–2008. In 2008–2012 he was the Commander of the Finnish Air Force, strongly promoting international cooperation. In 2012–2014, he returned to the Defence Command as Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics and Armaments. In 2014, General <a href="Ari%20Puheloinen">Ari Puheloinen</a> reached statutory retirement age, and Lindberg was appointed as the <a href="Chief%20of%20Defence%20%28Finland%29">Chief of Defence</a> i.e. commander of the Finnish Defence Forces.



Criticism.
In 2016, the National Audit Office (NAO) officially criticized Lindberg for frequently attending hunting and fishing events organized by military suppliers and contracts. Lindberg had spent 25 days a year on these trips. Many of them were without any official programme, and travel was paid by the organizer, which goes against the regulations of the FDF. NAO also found a liability in that this sort of culture for breaching regulations could spread to the rest of the organization; some evidence of other generals behaving similarly was found. Nevertheless, Assistant <a href="Parliamentary%20Ombudsman">Parliamentary Ombudsman</a> Maija Sakslin reviewed the case and decided not to prosecute, finding Lindberg's attendance of these social events acceptable.

Campeonato Paulista de Futebol de 1913 (APEA)

The Foot-Ball Championship of the São Paulo Sports Athletics Association of 1913 was the first edition of this sport competition between APSA affiliated São Paulo football clubs and is recognized as a legitimate edition of the Paulista Football Championship by the FPF. It is one of two tournaments officially recognized by the Paulista Football Federation as the Paulista Football Championship of that season. Its champion was the Atletico Paulistano Club, being the Mackenzie with the vice-championship.

Filmed between May 13 and October 11, he had three LPF dissident teams. All the clashes of the league were played in the field of the Velodrome Paulistano. In nine games, 36 goals were scored (an average of 4.0 per game).

History.
The FPF officially recognizes two competitions as legitimate editions of the 1913 Paulista Football Championship, each of which is organized by a different entity, one by the Paulista Athletic Sports Association and another by the Paulista Foot-Ball League. [2] That year, for the first time, there was a split in the elite of the soccer of São Paulo, due to political disputes. Disgruntled with LPF, a group led by Club Athletico Paulistano left the traditional entity and decided to create a parallel league in the city of São Paulo, organized by the newly founded APEA (or APSA, according to the original spelling). The breaking point was the possibility of the LPF accepting the joining of clubs of popular origin - such as the Sport Club Corinthians Paulista - and the exchange of the official field of the championship - the league closed with an exclusive rent with the Germanic, owner of the Park of the Antarctica Paulista, to the detriment of the Velodrome of São Paulo, belonging to Paulistano. Thus, for four seasons, football in the city of São Paulo would have two official rival leagues.

Competition Report.
Myrtown travelled over to Ireland for the 1974 Irish Derby hoping to go one place better than his <a href="1974%20English%20Greyhound%20Derby">1974 English Greyhound Derby</a> campaign but would face Ireland's best greyhounds. Prominent owner Cyril Scotland (owner of <a href="1972%20Irish%20Greyhound%20Derby">1972 winner</a> Catsrock Daisy) would enter another leading contender called Lively Band, a fawn dog who possessed significant early pace and had won the Derby consolation at <a href="White%20City%20Greyhounds">White City</a>.

Myrtown was ante-post favourite and progressed through the mandatory first round. Fastest in the round was Tain Rua who recorded 29.30.

The second round featured eight heats run on the same night for the first time and included a formidable race in which Myrtown won from Lively Band in 29.20. Other winners included the Irish TV Trophy winner Waverley Supreme and Nelson Blast but Tommy Astaire was eliminated. In the quarter-finals Myrtown won in 29.00 and still looked like the one to beat. Nelsons Blast set a time of 29.12 before Lively Band recorded 29.05; the remaining heat went to Shady Wagger. 

Myrtown suffered his first defeat in the semi-finals losing out to Shady Wagger; Lively Band won the other semi from <a href="National%20Produce%20Stakes%20%28Irish%20greyhounds%29">National Produce Stakes</a> champion Quote Me and Windjammer. 

The final draw proved pivotal because Lively Band and Myrtown both broke well from the traps but the latter found trouble trying to get across to the rails which allowed the Jack Murphy trained Lively Band to ease to victory from the strong finishing Windjammer. Quote Me failed to finish with a serious injury.

Thoracistus

Thoracistus is a genus of decticine or shield-backed <a href="katydid">katydid</a> in the family <a href="Tettigoniidae">Tettigoniidae</a>. The mostly carnivorous genus is endemic to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. 

Morphology.
This genus of decticine is extreme in the extent of its inflated pronotum. The pronotum completely conceals the tiny wings, which are used for stridulation only. The pronotum functions as a resonating chamber, to amplify the singing of the male. As in all decticines a "free plantula" is found at the base of the tarsus of the jumping leg. This pair of elongate pads may aid jumping in ground biomes. 

Biology.
They are bush or ground-dwelling insects, but unlike the majority of decticines, occur in mesic rather than xeric habitats. They hide by day in thickets, and become active at dusk when they ascend plants to feed on smaller insects. After dark males call to the females, which are silent. The sound of a male chorus can carry some distance. The eggs hatch from late spring to early summer. They reach adulthood from late summer to fall. 

Species.

Functional Arrhythmias

Functional Arrhythmias is an album by American jazz saxophonist <a href="Steve%20Coleman">Steve Coleman</a> and his band Five Elements, which was recorded in 2012 and released on <a href="Pi%20Recordings">Pi Recordings</a>. This version of the ensemble is notable for the return of <a href="Anthony%20Tidd">Anthony Tidd</a> on electric bass and <a href="Sean%20Rickman">Sean Rickman</a> on drums, both of who first played with the band over 15 years ago. The rest of the band consists of trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson and guitarist <a href="Miles%20Okazaki">Miles Okazaki</a>. 

Background.
The title of the album refers to the irrational rhythms found in healthy human heartbeat patterns and how many of its compositions utilize the heartbeat pulse. Coleman has long been fascinated with time-related themes, and "Functional Arrhythmias" is his attempt at creating a musical analogy of the rhythmic interaction between the circulatory, nervous, respiratory, and other biological systems of the human body. He credits drummer <a href="Milford%20Graves">Milford Graves</a> for providing the inspiration for his explorations.

Reception.
The "<a href="Down%20Beat">Down Beat</a>" review by Shaun Brady states "Most of the compositions on "Functional Arrhytmias" were transcribed from Coleman's improvisations, so the generally brief pieces seem to accrue layers of spontaneity, the melodies as daring and unpredictable as the improvisations."

The "<a href="JazzTimes">JazzTimes</a>" review by Lloyd Sachs says "This may be the most openly engaging, generous effort yet by the influential founder of the M-Base movement."

In a review for <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a>, Martin Longley states "This is the most exciting and substantial Coleman release of the last few years, rigorously challenging, pumped with insinuating melodies, sleek with propulsive energies and pulsating with a uniquely globular funkiness."

Only two favourites out of 17 won in the opening round, Shamrock Point being the fastest of them in 29.18 with next best being Tory Snowball in 29.21.

After a win in 29.03 by Shamrock Point in round two he looked to be the one to beat. The white and black dog had unluckily missed out on the <a href="1975%20English%20Greyhound%20Derby">English Derby final</a> the previous year before winning the consolation. The next best were Cindy's Speck and Sage both winners in 29.44.
The quarter finals arrived and there was a major shock as Shamrock Point was beaten by Cindy's Speck and Win Sam won another with a greyhound called Tain Mor eliminated. Shifting Shadow, a £600 purchase by Podger Molloy from Paddy O'Connor won the third before a controversy ensued in the fourth and final quarter final. Clopook Ivy was disqualified after passing the line first but Clopook Ivy’s owner Cora Jones disagreed with the disqualification and was granted a temporary injunction against Shelbourne Greyhound Stadium Ltd from holding the semi-finals. A few days later the High Court reversed the injunction but then the Supreme Court had to deal with an appeal before agreeing with the High Court. All this meant that the semi finals were delayed and started four days later than scheduled.

The racing got underway again and Shifting Shadow trained by Podger Molloy beat Moonshine Bandit and Sage with favourite Cindy's Speck failing to progress. The second semi-final race resulted in the elimination of Shamrock Point who found serious trouble leaving Macbeth to cross the line first from Again and Again.

The final line up was regarded as a weak line up but the finalists deserved to be there after progressing through four rounds. Shifting Shadow broke well from the traps and took a course on the rails, leading all the way and winning from Moonshine Bandit and Macbeth.

An Introduction to Life Plus One Day (Abad va Yek Rooz)

The entire movie Life + 1 Day, and the selected scene in particular, presents a dilemma for a poverty-stricken family over the youngest daughter’s supposedly willing choice to marry a rich Afghan, but which means she must leave her struggling family that includes her ill mother who is a homebound widow, a drug abusing brother, and another one in <a href="withdrawal">withdrawal stage</a>. Because of the many family problems, Somayeh is pressured by her brother to marry the rich Afghan in return for money to start his own new business. In this film, Roustayi presents the 21st century problems for Somayeh who is trapped by the demands dictated by a culture that offers her few choices.

A Scene from Life + 1 Day 2016 (Abad va Yek Rooz) by <a href="Saeed%20Roustayi">Saeed Roustayi</a>

"Mohsen: Somayeh, on what grounds you plan on leaving mom alone? Whenever you're not home your sisters don't feed her food or water, so she doesn't have to go to the bathroom. I'm asking you not to leave because I don't know who this guy is. Because mom is sick and if you go, she'll be done. Because our home and life will reek. But if you go, don't ever come back. Because they will no longer say their Azam won't remarry; that their Leila chooses not to marry. They will say that the problem is with them. Think about us. Don't turn us into a laughing stock of the neighborhood.

Morteza: That's tears from a high.

Shahnaz: She's seen Nazir. She says he's a good person.

Mohsen: He may be a good person, but she doesn't love him. She loves someone else, she still looks at his photos. I once saw them in the streets and I punched him in the face. And I didn't let her go back to her sewing class. Please don't go Somayeh. If you're leaving us because of me, don't."

Roustayi, the 28-year-old writer and director, relied on his camera lens and the indirect language of his screenplay to depict the prevailing social conditions of a struggling and impoverished family, as well as the <a href="marginalization">marginalization</a> and victimization of women. In this way, Roustayi and other Iranian filmmakers present the very real conditions and struggles of people in Iran that reflect very similar struggles of people around the world. In Life + 1 Day, Roustayi reveals how poverty and various conditions of power and class struggle present challenges for individuals and families.

2017 Fipronil eggs contamination

The 2017 Fipronil eggs contamination is an incident in Europe involving the spread of <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a> contaminated eggs and egg products.

The problem.
<a href="Egg%20as%20food">Chicken eggs</a> were found to contain <a href="fipronil">fipronil</a> and distributed to 15 <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> countries, Switzerland, and <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Approximately 700,000 eggs are thought to have reached shelves in the UK alone. Fipronil contaminated eggs may have been sold for a long time prior to the discovery of high levels. Fipronil was used in a remedy to destroy the <a href="poultry%20mite">poultry mite</a>. 

Initial actions.
Authorities in the Netherlands were alerted by an anonymous source in November 2016 that fipronil was being used in <a href="poultry%20farm">poultry farm</a>s, but failed to communicate the findings. 
In July/August 2017 millions of <a href="chicken%20egg">chicken egg</a>s were blocked from sale or withdrawn from the market in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="France">France</a> after elevated levels of fipronil were discovered by the Dutch food and product safety board. About 180 Dutch farms were temporarily shut down. In early August, <a href="Aldi">Aldi</a> reported removing all eggs for sale in their German stores as a precaution.

Official investigations.
Because the use of fipronil is illegal in the production of food for human consumption in Europe, a <a href="criminal%20investigation">criminal investigation</a> has been initiated. 

Early investigation led to two companies: ChickFriend, a provider of pest control services in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> suspected of knowingly using and selling DEGA-16 mixed with fipronil to hundreds of chicken farmers and Poultry Vision in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> accused of selling DEGA-16 mixed with fipronil to ChickFriend. DEGA-16 is a cleaning and sanitising natural product, that is approved to clean chicken stables. The Dutch owners of ChickFriend were arrested during a large scale operation conducted by Dutch law enforcement agencies on the 10th of August. 
First results of an investigation by Belgian police led to the discovery of 6 cubic meters of fipronil that Poultry Vision had imported from a chemical manufacturing company in <a href="Romania">Romania</a>.

The <a href="Dutch%20Safety%20Board">Dutch Safety Board</a> announced on the 8th of August that an official investigation has been initiated.

In South Korea, fipronil contaminated eggs, which were produced in <a href="Namyangju">Namyangju</a>, were found by the authority on August 14th. <a href="E-mart">E-mart</a>, <a href="Homeplus">Homeplus</a>, and <a href="Lotte%20Mart">Lotte Mart</a> stopped selling eggs temporarily on the same day.

Reported fipronil concentrations.
The <a href="Maximum%20Residue%20Limit">Maximum Residue Limit</a> (MRL) of fipronil in eggs is set at the detection limit of 0.005 mg/kg within the European Union, as is outlined in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005. 
Fipronil is classed as a WHO Class II moderately hazardous pesticide, and has a rat acute oral LD50 of 97 mg/kg. 

The Dutch food and product safety board (NVWA) reported that the test results of one batch of eggs originating from one poultry farm in the Netherlands exceeded the threshold of 0.72 mg/kg. Eggs containing fipronil values above this threshold could have possible negative health effects.

Career.
Blossom and Merchanthouse both attended <a href="Richmond%20High%20School%20%28Richmond%2C%20Indiana%29">Richmond High School</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>. The trio initially performed in a style similar to <a href="Peter%2C%20Paul%20and%20Mary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>. Recording in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, they released their first single, "Why Can't They Accept Us" – written and produced by Roger Atkins and Carl D'Errico, co-writers of <a href="the%20Animals">the Animals</a>' hit "<a href="It%27s%20My%20Life%20%28The%20Animals%20song%29">It's My Life</a>" – on <a href="Date%20Records">Date Records</a> in July 1966. The group was associated with the <a href="Screen%20Gems">Screen Gems</a> publishing company. Their second single, "<a href="Shades%20of%20Gray%20%28song%29">Shades of Gray</a>", was written by the company's staff writers <a href="Barry%20Mann">Barry Mann</a> and <a href="Cynthia%20Weil">Cynthia Weil</a>, and produced by <a href="Bill%20Traut">Bill Traut</a> of <a href="Dunwich%20Productions">Dunwich Productions</a>; the <a href="B-side">B-side</a>, "If You're Ready", had originally been recorded by <a href="the%20Del-Vetts">the Del-Vetts</a>, another group managed by Traut. "Shades of Gray" was later recorded by <a href="the%20Monkees">the Monkees</a> in 1967 on their album "<a href="Headquarters%20%28album%29">Headquarters</a>".

"It's Not Easy" was originally written for the <a href="Righteous%20Brothers">Righteous Brothers</a>, and had first been recorded in London in 1966 by Australian pop singer <a href="Normie%20Rowe">Normie Rowe</a>; his version was a chart hit in Australia and New Zealand.

In 1968, the Will-O-Bees transferred to Screen Gems' own <a href="SGC%20Records">SGC</a> label, and released three further singles, again produced by Traut. These included the Mann-Weil songs "<a href="Make%20Your%20Own%20Kind%20of%20Music%20%28song%29">Make Your Own Kind of Music</a>" and "<a href="It%27s%20Getting%20Better">It's Getting Better</a>", which were both later recorded more successfully by <a href="Mama%20Cass%20Elliot">Mama Cass Elliot</a>. The Will-O-Bees also recorded and released the theme song of the unsuccessful TV sitcom "<a href="The%20Ugliest%20Girl%20in%20Town">The Ugliest Girl in Town</a>", written by <a href="Howard%20Greenfield">Howard Greenfield</a> and <a href="Helen%20Miller%20%28songwriter%29">Helen Miller</a>. However, none of the group's SGC recordings made the charts, and the group made no further recordings after early 1969.

2017 Central Luzon bird flu outbreak

An outbreak of bird flu or <a href="avian%20influenza">avian influenza</a> affected <a href="poultry">poultry</a> in the town of <a href="San%20Luis%2C%20Pampanga">San Luis</a>, <a href="Pampanga">Pampanga</a> in 2017. The occurrence is the first avian flu outbreak recorded in the Philippines.

Outbreak.
Occurrence of avian influenza in Pampanga was first reported by farms in the last week of April 2017. The first farm to be affected by the disease was reportedly a <a href="quail">quail</a> farm. The Department of Agriculture (DA) confirmed the avian influenza outbreak on August 11, 2017 and a state of calamity was declared by the provincial government of Pampanga on the same day. By that time a total of 116,000 birds in farms has been identified to have the virus with 37,000 birds already dead due to the disease.

On August 18, 2017, Agriculture Secretary <a href="Manny%20Pi%C3%B1ol">Manny Piñol</a> confirmed that two new cases of bird flu in the towns of Jaen and San Isidro in <a href="Nueva%20Ecija">Nueva Ecija</a>.

Cause.
The strain of the avian influenza virus is not of the <a href="H5N1">H5N1</a> strain according to the <a href="Research%20Institute%20for%20Tropical%20Medicine">Research Institute for Tropical Medicine</a> which conducted testings on samples of the virus from infected birds. The samples are sent to Australia to confirm the exact strain of the avian flu virus.

Prevention.
A quarantine zone was imposed centering Barangay San Carlos of San Luis which covered an area . The quarantine radius covers five barangays in San Luis, Mexico and Santa Ana towns. Within the quarantine zone a total of 200 thousand birds wild or domesticated will be culled during a three-day period. The corpses will be buried in a highly elevated place. Animals within the designated area will be quarantined for 90 days while those in the surrounding area will be quarantined for 21 days.

Trade ban.
Through a circular dated on August 11, 2017, the Department of Agriculture imposed a temporary ban against transporting birds and poultry products from Pampanga to other parts of Luzon as well as banned the transfer of live poultry and poultry products from Luzon to Visayas and Mindanao to prevent the spread of the disease.

Epidemiology.
It is yet to be determined how avian influenza was successfully transmitted to the Philippines. The <a href="Department%20of%20Agriculture%20%28Philippines%29">Department of Agriculture</a> either suspects that the virus was transmitted by migratory birds or through the smuggling of <a href="Peking%20Duck">Peking Duck</a>s through <a href="Port%20of%20Subic">Subic Port</a>. The farm where the avian flu originated had a practice of setting up quails above ducks.

Design Manchester

Design Manchester is a not-for-profit organisation established to showcase design talent; support design skills, careers & enterprise; advance the contribution of design in the city and the regional economy; and promote the role of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> as a design city internationally. It has a year-round programme of activities and events and organises Manchester’s annual citywide festival of design.

History.
In 2013, graphic designers John Owens and <a href="Malcolm%20Garrett">Malcolm Garrett</a> <a href="Royal%20Designers%20for%20Industry">RDI</a> and media publicist Fiona McGarva were asked by Professor David Crow, then the Dean of <a href="Manchester%20School%20of%20Art">Manchester School of Art</a>, to organise an event to mark the School’s 175th anniversary and the opening of the new Benzie Building designed by <a href="Feilden%20Clegg%20Bradley%20Studios">Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios</a>. Their response was to organise a festival under the name ‘Design Manchester’, comprising nine events including a professional design conference, an exhibition, talks, workshops and parties, with the stated aim of creating an annual festival of design for the city. The following year the team was joined by Garrett’s business partner, the writer Kasper de Graaf. A vehicle initially set up to organise the annual festival was replaced by the incorporation of Design Manchester Ltd as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee on 17 August 2015 and that same year, <a href="Arts%20Council%20England">Arts Council England</a> funded the development of a business plan for the organisation. The annual festival is produced and delivered by the directors, a festival producer and a team drawn from the staff of media publicists Sundae Communications and design companies Instruct and Images&Co, alongside scores of partners and volunteers.

Programme.
Design Manchester works with <a href="Manchester%20City%20Council">Manchester City Council</a>, the <a href="Mayor%20of%20Greater%20Manchester">Mayor of Greater Manchester</a> and local stakeholders in industry, education and the community to advance the contribution of design in key challenge areas, including health & care, transport, age-friendly design, cognitive design, education and skills, employment, start-up incubation and the global perception of Manchester as a design city. Year-round activities with designers and artists, schools, colleges, universities and community groups culminate in the annual festival of design: a showcase for talent and an opportunity to engage, consult and co-create. In 2017, Design Manchester was commissioned by Manchester City Council Leader and Greater Manchester Deputy Mayor for Business and Economy <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Leese">Sir Richard Leese</a> to conduct a research study to underpin development of a design strategy for the city.

A parallel exhibition at The Refuge and throughout the city, titled "Orgasm Addict Reframed", invites leading designers and emerging creatives to re-imagine the famed record sleeve that featured in the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">V&A</a>’s Postmodernism exhibition, where Garrett (then still a student at Manchester School of Art) had collaborated with his artist friend <a href="Linder%20Sterling">Linder Sterling</a>, taking her montage illustration, turning it upside down and printing it in single colour to create the graphic impact of the striking blue and yellow sleeve. The fourth track on the EP of Buzzcocks events is an exhibition titled "Time’s Up" at the <a href="University%20of%20Bolton">University of Bolton</a>, where (when it was Bolton Institute of Technology) the band was formed in 1976.

Competition Report.
The event was now worth £15,500 to the winner and top entries for the 1976 running were the <a href="Ger%20McKenna">Ger McKenna</a> pair of Ballybeg Prim and Shamrock Point. Ballybeg Prim had performed well in the <a href="1976%20English%20Greyhound%20Derby">1976 English Greyhound Derby</a> and Shamrock Point had once again won the English Derby consolation. 

The competition started badly for Ballybeg Prim who was knocked out, he had lost considerable weight travelling back to Ireland which consequently made him run a poor race. Cindy's Speck also crashed out but Shamrock Point qualified but failed to win his heat beaten by Tory Snowball. The highlight of the round was the English challenger Flip Your Top who won in 29.30. Tain Mor, the recent Cambridgeshire winner over 600 yards, ran well over the shorter distance to claim a heat win. 

Tain Mor then produced a very fast 29.04 in the second round, a run that impressed and Tory Snowball won again in a fast 29.18. Shamrock Point disappointed and made it no further after being eliminated. The quarter finals provided further shocks as Tory Snowball and Win Sam both failed to progress any further with the four races being won by Silly Socket, Stylish Cutlet, Bins Bridge and Ashmore Merry.

The semi-finals arrived and resulted in one of the most sensational nights in Shelbourne Park history. Tain Mor won in a very fast time of 28.95, Strike At Dawn and Carn Top did well to qualify for the final behind him. Then in the second semi-final Ashmore Merry drew clear of the field and came home in a new track record of 28.74. Suddenly from a competition that was in need of a boost there were two stars ready to compete in the final. The two drew poor trap draws in the final with trap 4 and 5 respectively, but both were still heavily backed into 7-4 joint favourites.

In an exciting final the heavily gambled Bins Bridge lost his early lead to Antone Wonder down the back straight, by the third bend Tain Mor who had found a little trouble got into his stride and passed the pair moving clear to win. Carn Top finished well to grab the runner-up spot but Ashmore Merry ran poorly. The connections of Ashmore Merry witnessed one of their other greyhounds Tantallons Gift break the one week old track record in a supporting race after recording 28.73.

Lana Zangana

<a href="http%3A//www.lanazangana.com">Lana Zangana</a>,( لانه زەنگەنە) born October 21989, is a prominent Kurdish singer and entrepreneur. Lana Zangana debuted with “Nehni Ewin” in Kurdistan in 2013. Lana Zangana chooses her music and lyrics carefully. She shares the belief that music is very important for the preservation of culture and language. Her Kurdish roots, specifically, were preserved by the music she used to listen to as a child in Iraq and The Netherlands.

Early life.
Lana Zangana was born in Kirkuk, Kurdistan on October the 2nd, 1989. Her father was born in Kirkuk, and her mother in Slemani (Qaradag). Lana Zangana is the third child of a family of four. She earned a Bachelor’s degree in Events and Business Management (2011) and graduated her Master-studies in International Business and Management in 2013. Although Lana Zangana was always drawn to music, she decided to finish her Business studies before pursuing her career as a singer. This turned out to be a very wise decision as she is now able to personally manage her own singing career. Her father is a civil engineer and her mother is a school teacher for students with special needs. Lana Zangana is surrounded by a highly creative family. Her oldest brother, <a href="http%3A//www.hozanzangana.com">Hozan Zangana</a>, is a well-known and respected Designer. Her sister, Hana Zangana, is a writer, poet and editor. Her youngest brother, Hewa Zangana, is a company strategic consultant. Her aunt is the great Kurdish poet, writer and activist <a href="Mahabad_Qaradaghi">Mahabad Qaradagi</a>, who also gave Lana the poem for the first videoclip, “Nehni Ewin”. Lana Zangana is fluent in five language: Dutch, English, Kurdish, Arabic and German. At the age of 7, Lana and her family fled Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath regime and went to Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This was a huge change in her life which subsequently shaped her into the creative and strong woman she is now. As a young girl, Lana Zangana enjoyed a happy childhood filled with joyful memories. She was always singing, dancing and putting up shows for her family and friends in the Netherlands. She joined a theatre group, which was the first time she experienced the magic of being on stage. She enjoyed performing in front of a crowd. Although acting was one of her favorite arts, her passion always remained in music. Therefore, she chose to educate herself singing in both Kurdish and Arabic. 

Career.
At the age of 15, Lana Zangana started developing her professional singing through participation in different national festivals throughout the Netherlands. She sang mostly in Arabic, as it was better known to the Dutch people. Nevertheless, she was later invited to sing in Kurdish on important Kurdish events and for the Dutch Consulate-General in Erbil. Lana Zangana is fluent in singing Arabic with three different dialects, Iraqi, Egyptian and Lebanese, and therefore she has had many videos and concerts on which she sings in both languages, Kurdish and Arabic. Lana Zangana recorded her first video clip, “<a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dk_EGeEPG9JY">Nehni Ewin</a>”, which was broadcast on Kurdish television, in 2013. Lana Zangana had recorded her second video clip “<a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DTMwohupII_w">Kasi Du Ru</a>” in 2013. Lana Zangana’s third video clip was the live-cover “<a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCTAb5UBCRqc">Mahi min</a>” of the famous Kurdish singer <a href="Adnan_Karim">Adnan Karim</a>. Lana’s fourth song called “<a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7k_0aswuDj4">Bo Detewê</a>” was recorded in Amsterdam in 2016. Later that year Lana Zangana recorded her first hit song “<a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DufnAb7MLtIY">Chopyakat</a>”, which had an astonishing 1.5 Million views within six months. Lana Zangana was the first Kurdish singer ever to reach this amount of views within six months after releasing. On September the 25th 2017, the Kurdish people were asked by the Kurdish government to vote for an independent Kurdistan. Therefore, Lana Zangana recorded her sixth song “Referendum”, in which she brings the subject of an independent Kurdistan under attention. 

Lana Zangana has been interviewed by many tv shows in Iraqi Kurdistan and for Arabic TV stations in Lebanon. Lana was on “Jinu Jiyan” on KurdMax, “Like Magazine” on Koshki Net TV, “Ziad gallary”, on “Kmagazin”, “Bernamê şeyda” on WAAR TV and on “Tital” on Rudaw. She was on various Lebanese radio, she was interviewed for an article on “Sayidatynet Magazine”, and many other different media platforms. Lana Zangana has worked together with <a href="Mahabad_Qaradaghi">Mahabad Qaradagi</a>, Halkawt Zaher, <a href="Ragheb_Alama">Ragheb Alama</a>, Fayez AlSaeed, Rayan, and Karim el Iraki.

Artistry.
The music that shaped her as a singer arose from the most influential artists from Kurdistan, Turkey and Arab countries. Therefore, Lana Zangana uses different themes throughout her music, such as pop, techno and modern/romantic.

Competition Report.
The Irish Derby trial stakes held around Ireland had previously failed to produce an ultimate winner of the Irish Derby but in 1977 this changed. The Kilkenny Greyhound Stadium]] trial stakes winner Linda's Champion had entered the stake for just £5 and gained a free entry to the competition itself by winning the Kilkenny heat.

The first round proper featured 105 entries and despite a Racing Managers strike which had closed most Irish tracks for a month. Heading the ante-post betting was the litter brothers Greenane Decca and Glen Rock both trained by Paddy Nugent, and the newly crowned <a href="Welsh%20Greyhound%20Derby">Welsh Greyhound Derby</a> champion Instant Gambler handled by Jack Murphy.
English hope Gaily Noble recorded 29.17 before one of the leading contenders Glen Rock pulled up and stopped in a later heat. Other winners included Shady Monkey (29.19), Brush Tim (29.23) and Ballintee Star (29.26).

Instant Gambler impressed with a time of 28.94 in round two; Brush Tim recorded 29.02 for new trainer Francie Murray, Francie had taken over from his father Mick. Gaily Noble went well again in 29.07. Linda's Champion won in 29.25 and remarkably was competing in the <a href="Tipperary%20Cup">Tipperary Cup</a> at the same time as the Derby. 

In the quarter finals Instant Gambler failed to progress further and the Eugene McNamara trained Swibo defeated Gaily Noble. Linda's Champion and Greenane Decca won the remaining two heats. In the semi-final <a href="Gay%20McKenna">Gay McKenna</a> gained success by claiming the first heat with 10-1 shot Black Bart from Brush Tim and Linda's Champion. The second heat resulted in Rokeel Light beating Greenane Decca and Boolas Hill. 

Greenane Decca had beaten Linda's Champion in the <a href="National%20Produce%20Stakes%20%28Irish%20greyhounds%29">National Produce Stakes</a> final earlier in the year but this time the tables were turned as Linda's Champion led all the way before holding off a late challenge by Brush Tim. The photo finish went in favour of the former and Greenane Decca finished third. Linda's Champion also won the Tipperary Cup during the event.

Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup Bid

On 11 August 2017, the <a href="Royal%20Moroccan%20Football%20Federation">Royal Moroccan Football Federation</a> announced that they would submit a bid for the <a href="2026%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2026 FIFA World Cup</a> 

Unlike the Joint bid of US-Canada and Mexico. Morocco would be the sole host of the event.

Background.
Morocco previously submitted a bid for the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a> but eventually was awarded to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. There was some rumours that <a href="Spain">Spain</a> could be jointly bidding but the rules prohibited this from happening.

Bid process.
Bidding for the 2026 FIFA World Cup was postponed due to the <a href="2015%20FIFA%20corruption%20case">2015 FIFA corruption case</a> and the subsequent resignation of <a href="Sepp%20Blatter">Sepp Blatter</a>, then it was restarted following the FIFA Council meeting on 10 May 2016, wherein the bidding process will consist of four phases:

With no rival bid having emerged since April 2017 the CONCACAF member federations of Canada, Mexico and the United States sent a joint request to FIFA to hasten the bid process. Canada, Mexico and the United States wanted FIFA to award the bid outside the traditional bidding process at the June 2018 FIFA Congress in Moscow if the CONCACAF-bid meets FIFA requirements.

However the <a href="FIFA%20Council">FIFA Council</a> decided on 8 May 2017 that <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> would have a full bidding procedure. In order to ensure continental rotation of hosting duties, only the member associations of <a href="Confederation%20of%20African%20Football">CAF</a>, <a href="CONCACAF">CONCACAF</a>, <a href="CONMEBOL">CONMEBOL</a> and the <a href="Oceania%20Football%20Confederation">OFC</a> were invited, as these continental confederations had not hosted the two previous World Cups. A date of 11 August 2017 was set for submission of an intention to bid.

FIFA football tournament hosting experiences.
<a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> have hosted a number of FIFA Events before including the <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>.

Potential venues.
Stadiums must be able to accommodate a hospitality village no more than 150 metres from the stadium. They must also have a capacity of at least 40,000 for group and second round matches and 60,000 for quarter finals and 80,000 for the final.

Competition Report.
<a href="Ger%20McKenna">Ger McKenna</a> was once again the trainer of the ante-post favourite for the Irish Derby, this time it was with Here's Tat. With no <a href="Welsh%20Greyhound%20Derby">Welsh Greyhound Derby</a> there was a bigger gap to the start of the event than usual. 

When the first round got underway it was <a href="National%20Produce%20Stakes%20%28Irish%20greyhounds%29">National Produce Stakes</a> champion Always Kelly that was the fastest heat winner in 29.15. 

Here's Tat went fastest in round two after recording 29.04, followed by Hunday Dook in 29.05 and <a href="1978%20English%20Greyhound%20Derby">English Derby</a> finalist Glenroe Hiker (29.09). Glenroe Hiker attracted support and went into the quarter finals on a par in the ante-post lists with Here's Tat. During the quarter finals Glenroe Hiker recorded 29.08 and Hunday Dook won again in 29.10, there were also heat successes for Pampered Rover and Killaclug Jet.

Two strong looking semi-finals then took place, firstly Ivy Hall Solo and Here's Tat vied with each other in a battle that ending in a sensational winning time of 28.85 for Ivy Hall Solo. In the second decider Hunday Dook continued to impress and crossed the line in 28.93 ahead of Malange. The third semi was a slower heat with Ahaveen Spitfire beating Pampered Rover in 29.35.

The first prize of £20,000 equalled the English Derby prize and went to the outsider Pampered Rover after he was very fast out of the traps and took the decisive lead at the first bend from Hunday Dook and trouble behind ensured that the rest of the field could not make inroads into the leader. Pampered Rover's success meant that trainer Paddy Keane became the first trainer to lift the Irish and English Derby.

Breakthrough curve

A breakthrough curve in <a href="adsorption">adsorption</a> is the course of the effluent adsorptive concentration at the outlet of a fixed bed adsorber Breakthrough curves are important for adsorptive separation technologies and for the characterization of porous materials.

Importance.
Since almost all adsorptive separation processes are dynamic -meaning, that they are running under flow - testing porous materials for those applications for their separation performance has to be tested under flow as well. Since separation processes run with mixtures of different components, measuring several breakthrough curves results in thermodynamic mixture equilibria - mixture sorption isotherms, that are hardly accessible with static manometric sorption characterization. This enables the determination of sorption selectivities in gaseous and liquid phase.

The determination of breakthrough curves is the foundation of many other processes, like the <a href="pressure%20swing%20adsorption">pressure swing adsorption</a>. Within this process, the loading of one adsorber is equivalent to a breakthrough experiment.

Measurement.
A fixed bed of porous materials (e.g. activated carbons and zeolites) is pressurized and purged with a carrier gas. After becoming stationary one or more adsorptives are added to the carrier gas, resulting in a step-wise change of the inlet concentration. This is in contrast to chromatographic separation processes, where pulse-wise changes of the inlet concentrations are used. The course of the adsorptive concentrations at the outlet of the fixed bed are monitored.

Results.
Integration of the area above the entire breakthrough curve give the loading of the adsorptive. Additionally, the duration of the breakthrough experiment until a certain threshold of the adsorptive concentration at the outlet can be measured, which enables the calculation of a technically usable sorption capacity. Up to this time, the quality of the product stream can be maintained. The shape of the breakthrough curves contains information about the mass transfer properties of the adsorptive-adsorbens system. These properties can by evaluated by applying simplified models and fitting to experimental data by simulations.

Auguste Mimerel

Auguste Mimerel (1 June 1786 – 16 April 1871) was a French industrialist and politician.
He was owner of a large cotton mill, and was active in industry associations.
He supported the use of child labor, and was in favor of high tariffs to protect domestic industry.
He became a deputy in the legislature in the short-lived <a href="French%20Second%20Republic">French Second Republic</a>, then a senator during the <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">Second French Empire</a>.
In 1867 he was made a Count of the Empire.

Early years: Revolution and Empire (1786–1814).
Auguste Mimerel was born on 1 June 1786 in St Firmin-en-Castillon, <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a>, Somme.
He came from a provincial bourgeois family. 
He was the third of six children of Antoine Firmin Mimerel (1750–1828) and Guillaine Françoise Florence Le Bas (1761–1830).
In 11 May 1809, in Paris, he married Marie-Joséphine Flahaut, daughter of Adrien Joseph Flahaut.
They had two children, Antoine Auguste Edouard Mimeral (1812–81) and Caroline Augustine Joséphine Mimerel (1816–97).
Mimerel was a tall man at with powerful shoulders, grey-eyed, highly intelligent, and dominating.

Bourbon Restoration (1814–30).
The Mimerels moved to <a href="Roubaix">Roubaix</a>, a small town outside <a href="Lille">Lille</a> with just over 8,000 inhabitants, on 7 April 1816.
Auguste Mimerel was 30 and had been working in the textile trade for twelve years.
He was given the opportunity to partner with Théodore Delaoutre's textile trading company, Filature Delaoutre, which soon became the Delaoutre-Mimerel company.
Mimerel created one of the largest cotton mills in the <a href="Nord%20%28French%20department%29">Nord department</a>.

In 1924 Mimerel created the Committee of Spinners of Lille to defend protection of their industry.
His views were <a href="Malthusianism">Malthusian</a> and could be summarized as "low investment, few exports and high tariffs."
He was in turn President of the Conseil des Prud'hommes (1827), President of the Consultative Chamber of Manufactures (1828) and Municipal Councilor of Roubaix (1830).
Just before the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> of 1830 the Prefect of the Nord identified Mimerel and his brother, a justice of the peace, as "leaders of the hostile party" in Roubaix.
That is, they were liberal and opposed to the Bourbon monarchy.

July Monarchy (1830–48).
After the July Revolution Mimerel retained liberal principles at first.
As late as the fall of 1832 Mimerel, as President of the Consultative Chamber of Arts and Manufactures of Roubaix, was opposed to the seizure of foreign wool by customs, because "it would be against the spirit and needs of the century, which both demand new commercial freedoms rather than new constraints."
During 1833–34 he became fully converted to protectionism.
Mimerel was the most vocal of the industrialists during the commercial inquiry organized by <a href="Tanneguy%20Duch%C3%A2tel">Tanneguy Duchâtel</a> in October–November 1834.
He spoke as Mayor of Roubaix and Chamber of Commerce delegate for Lille, Roubaix and <a href="Tourcoing">Tourcoing</a>.
He said, "Lifting prohibition will compromise the existence of considerable numbers of French citizens."
He fiercely defended industrial liberty within France and opposed repeal of protection against foreign goods.
He said national producers must show solidarity, and there would be revolts by the workers if British goods were allowed in.

Auguste Mimerel was mayor of <a href="Roubaix">Roubaix</a> from 9 April 1834 to 7 July 1836.
He was made a Knight of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> in 1834.
He was General Councilor of Nord (1837), President of the Council (1839) and President of the General Council of Manufactures in Paris (1840).

In 1835 Mimerel stated publicly that half of the workers in his cotton mill in Lille were children.
They usually started work at the age of eight, often earlier, had the same hours as adults and had no schooling or protection of any form.
He clearly thought that employment was better than limited schooling and long periods of idleness.
In his 1840 "Tableau" <a href="Louis-Ren%C3%A9%20Villerm%C3%A9">Louis-René Villermé</a> described child labor conditions in the textile industry as "too terrible to be endured".
In 1841 the work of Villermé, the report of Alexandre Loiset on insanitary housing in Lille and the intervention of <a href="Jean-Paul-Alban%20Villeneuve-Barcement">Villeneuve-Bargemont</a> led to a law regulating child labour.
The employers of Nord were particularly hostile to the bill, saying that although the children worked long hours their work was not tiring, and it was not possible to separate the work of adults and children.
It was unjust to blame industrialists for working-class pauperism.
In an open letter of 1841 entitled "Pauperism, its increase attributed to industry in a host of writings", Mimerel pointed out that pauperism existed before the industrial revolution, and it was normal for it to be found among workers.
He said that manufacturers showed humanity and charity by founding hospices and setting up canteens for their workers.
The Comité pour la Défense du Travail National was founded in 1842 in an effort to coordinate the protectionist manufacturers' lobbies.
Mimerel was the main mover.
He influenced the lobbies to stress self-sufficiency rather than rivalry with foreigners, and to subsidize the mainstream press to promote protectionism.
In his "Du paupérisme dans ses rapports avec l'industrie en France et en Angleterre" (Lille, 1842) Mimerel tried to show that protection mostly favoured the workers rather than just a few privileged manufacturers.
He noted that "the hideous wound of pauperism" was mostly found in British cities. 
Britain depended on foreign markets as outlets for its cheap textiles, so was vulnerable to any downturns in these markets and had reduced its workers to a state of "abject destitution".
He argued that "if foreign labour cannot access our market, workers, rare in relation to the number of machines, will receive constant and high salaries for a long time." 
He also blamed economists and socialists for spreading "moral poverty" rather than "real destitution", where raised expectations caused the workers to see a satisfactory condition as unbearable. 

"Du paupérisme" portrayed Britain as an aristocratic society in which the privileged classes used the workers only as tools of production, in contrast to the more egalitarian society of France.
In fact, at this time social legislation was more advanced in Britain and workers earned more than in France.
Also, French exports were growing rapidly.
However, there may be an element of truth in the idea that French industrialization was slower but less brutal than in Britain. 
Mimerel wrote that "sedition has almost always been fomented by the better paid. They are motivated much less by misery than by economic ideas and proposals for social reform which they would have been much happier to have known nothing about. ... not that we want to impose limits on the instruction of the people, but we would prefer whatever restores to the individual a sense of contentment with his position in society and encourages him to improve it by means of orderliness and work, rather than ideas which lead him to ruin himself in pointless complaints and in unrealistic projects."

In 1946 the Association for the Defense of National Labor (ADTN: Association pour la défense du travail national) was formed to oppose the lowering of tariffs.
The ADTN created a newspaper, "Le Moniteur Industriel", that aggressively denounced ""libre-échange"".
Local committees were founded and protests organized against attempts to copy British policies. 
Most manufacturers backed the ADTN campaign, as did grain producers and even some shippers. 
The ADTN brought together the four major employers associations: coal mines, eastern industrialists, metallurgists and machine makers.
The association had a central committee, an office and a director based in Paris, ordinary members and about 40 local committees.
The association's council in 1847 included <a href="Antoine%20Odier">Antoine Odier</a> (President), Auguste Mimerel (Vice-President), <a href="Joseph%20Perier">Joseph Perier</a> (Treasurer) and <a href="Louis-Martin%20Lebeuf">Louis-Martin Lebeuf</a> (Secretary).
Members included <a href="Henri%20Barbet">Henri Barbet</a>, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Talabot">Léon Talabot</a> and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Schneider">Eugène Schneider</a>.
The Association was opposed to the reform of the customs system advocated by <a href="Laurent%20Cunin-Gridaine">Laurent Cunin-Gridaine</a>.
In 1846 <a href="Jules%20Hochet">Jules Hochet</a>, iron master at <a href="Fourchambault">Fourchambault</a>, became a member of the association.

Mimerel was made an Officer of the Legion of Honor (1846).
He ran for election to the legislature on 1 August 1846 for the 3rd constituency of Nord (Lille) but was defeated.

French Second Republic (1848–51).
Auguste Mimerel supported the <a href="French%20Revolution%20of%201848">French Revolution of 1848</a>.
During the <a href="French%20Second%20Republic">French Second Republic</a> he was a deputy for Nord from 13 May 1849 to 2 December 1851 on the Bonapartist platform.
He supported the policy of <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>.
Mimerel was president of the ADTN in 1849.
He succeeded in excluding foreign products from the <a href="Exposition%20des%20produits%20de%20l%27industrie%20fran%C3%A7aise">Exposition des produits de l'industrie française</a> of 1849.

Second Empire (1851–70).
In the <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">Second French Empire</a> Auguste Mimerel was made a senator on 26 January 1852, holding office until the fall of the empire.
He was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour in 1852.
He was a member of the jury of the <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281855%29">Exposition Universelle (1855)</a>.

The ADTN lasted until 1860, when the Franco-British <a href="Cobden%E2%80%93Chevalier%20Treaty">Cobden–Chevalier Treaty</a> of 1860 liberalized trade between the two countries.
Arguing against the treaty, Mimerel pointed out that if France had been dependent on English coal she would have been vulnerable to an embargo during the <a href="Franco-Austrian%20War">Franco-Austrian War</a> of 1859.
However, although bad for textile manufacturers, the treaty did less damage to coal and steel interests.
Auguste Mimerel resigned and the association disintegrated, leaving the great employers' federations to go their own ways.
Mimerel became president of the General Council of Nord in 1860, and stopped attacking government policy.
He was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1863.
In 1863 Mimerel encouraged Belgian workers to move to France so wages could be pushed down.

At the start of 1869 Gustave Masure published articles in the republican "Progrès du Nord" that attacked Mimerel.
They accused the senator of having usurped noble titles that he did not legally possess, but the main criticism was a speech by Mimerel, read for him in the Senate by Dumay, in which he glorified free trade.
Mimerel had completely changed his position, and said, "It is no exaggeration to say that French industry will not perish, In the midst of our trials discouragement never entered our hearts." He now spoke of an invigorated industry and the welfare of the workmen.
Soon after the speech was read, Mimerel was made a Count of the Empire, in what Masure saw as a reward for his change.
It it is possible that Mimerel never had strong convictions, but simply behaved in public in a way that would help him rise socially.

Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting

On June 27, 2016, a private meeting was held between former President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and then <a href="attorney%20general">attorney general</a> <a href="Loretta%20E.%20Lynch">Loretta E. Lynch</a> on the <a href="tarmac">tarmac</a> of <a href="Phoenix%20Sky%20Harbor%20International%20Airport">Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport</a> aboard Lynch's aircraft. The meeting took place hours prior to "the Obama Department of Justice decision on whether then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had revealed classified information when using a private email account".In response to the meeting, Lynch said "Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren, it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix." In December following Hillary Clinton's defeat to Donald Trump, Lynch said in an interview about the meeting that "It did make people wonder is it going to affect the investigation that's going on, and that's not something that was an unreasonable question for anyone to ask." 

Background.
Lynch's arrival in Phoenix on June 27, 2016 was the second-to-last stop on her national tour to promote community policing. After she met with the city's police officers and top officials, she had a surprise visit from former President Bill Clinton who boarded her plane on the tarmac. He and Lynch spoke privately for about a half-hour. A law enforcement official reported that "the former president saw Lynch's plane on the tarmac and walked onto her aircraft." The security detail for Lynch allowed Clinton to board Lynch's plane. At the time, presidential candidate and former <a href="Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Hillary%20Clinton%20email%20controversy">Hillary Clinton</a> was under investigation by the <a href="FBI">FBI</a> for her indiscriminate use of a <a href="private%20server">private server</a>.

Obama White House Involvement.
Reporters at the June 30, 2016 White House press conference pressed then White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest with questions about the meeting between former President Clinton and attorney general Lynch on the tarmac. Earnest commended Lynch for her direct answers to the questions she was asked about the meeting. When Ernest was further questioned about whether then President Obama approved of the meeting while an FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server was ongoing, he avoided a direct answer by saying, "I wasn't there for the meeting" and reiterated then President Obama’s insistence that the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private server should continue "without political interference."

James Comey's decision to go public.
On May 3, 2017, then FBI Director James Comey testified before the <a href="Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> oversight hearing of the FBI. During his testimony, Comey said that "Lynch's meeting in his view tarnished her credibility on the issue", which forced the FBI to distance itself from the Department of Justice, and announce the conclusion of their investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private server. He added "And then the capper was – and I'm not picking on the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, who I like very much – but her meeting with President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for me." 

Reactions to the meeting.
On June 30, 2016, some of the initial reactions after learning about the meeting included presumptive presidential candidate <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> who called the meeting "shocking and very disappointing". Senator <a href="John%20Cornyn">John Cornyn</a> (TX-R) suggested the Clinton email investigation should be taken over by Special Councel in an effort to "instill confidence in the American people that her department can fully and fairly conduct this investigation." Senator <a href="Chris%20Coons">Chris Coons</a> (DE-D) believed "Lynch will remain objective in her role but would have advised against the meeting".

History.
In 2008, while working in conference management, Lewis had an idea for a durable male sex toy. He discovered an article on Penile Vibratory Stimulation, which described a way to bring about ejaculation in men with spinal cord injuries, regardless of sensation below the waist. He went to Denmark to meet the scientists who had developed equipment to do this, and obtained the patents to use the technology in his sex toy.

Lewis and partner Julia Margo, created Pulse, which was described by "<a href="Wired">Wired</a>" as a "Darth Vader-style vibro helmet for penises. It sold out in the first six months by word of mouth. In 2015, Pulse II, with a second motor was released. In 2016 the company released Pulse III.

In January 2016, after a "<a href="Time%20Out">Time Out</a>" survey revealed that 39% of male New Yorkers masturbated while at work, Hot Octopuss created a masturbation booth called GuyFi in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> that invited men to self-stimulate their penises to ejaculation.

Hot Octopuss' was featured in "Pillow Talk" that had sex expert, Jenny Block (who blogs regularly for <a href="Huffington%20Post">Huffington Post</a>) riding around Manhattan on a four-poster bed. The event was featured on ABC's Nightline.

Early life and education.
Lewis was born in <a href="Nicholson%2C%20Georgia">Nicholson, Georgia</a> in 1924. Her parents were Hugh and Maurie Matthews, a postal worker and nurse, respectively, and her sister was named JoAnn. She spent her early years in <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Georgia">Jackson county</a>, where she witnessed and was deeply affected by <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a> racial discrimination. When Lewis was 10, her family moved to <a href="Forsyth%20County%2C%20Georgia">Forsyth County</a>, where her father used his mail delivery job to warn incoming African Americans that Forsyth county was a dangerous place for them.

Lewis attended <a href="Tift%20College">Tift College</a>, where she studied for a year before taking a year off to work.

Gurney Rowlerson (1861 or 1862 – 29 July 1944) was a <a href="British%20people">British</a> <a href="trade%20unionist">trade unionist</a>.

Rowlerson worked as a tailor and became active in the <a href="Amalgamated%20Society%20of%20Tailors%20and%20Tailoresses">Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses</a> (ASTT). He was elected to its executive council in 1900, soon becoming a full-time employee of the union, and was elected as its general secretary in 1925.

Rowlerson was consistently critical of the formation of rival unions in the tailoring industry, many of which organised Jewish workers. In 1908, he opposed the formation of the London Ladies' Tailors' Union, saying that "...most of the ladies' tailors' are foreigners". In 1915, he tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade the <a href="General%20Federation%20of%20Trade%20Unions%20%28UK%29">General Federation of Trade Unions</a> to get various small affiliates to become branches of the ASTT rather than form the <a href="United%20Garment%20Workers%27%20Trade%20Union">United Garment Workers' Trade Union</a> (UGWTU). He was sometimes critical of Jewish people in general, claiming that Jewish branch secretaries in the ASTT were inefficient and mismanaged finances. However, by the 1920s, he moderated his positions and tried to encourage Jewish workers to join the ASTT.

In 1932, Rowlerson led the ASTT into the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Tailors%20and%20Garment%20Workers">National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers</a>, becoming the union's general president. He retired in 1937, although he continued to serve as the union's representative on the Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board.

Gade has warned wounded veterans that relying on government disability checks may be harmful, saying "People who stay home because they are getting paid enough to get by on disability are worse off.

Rabbi Yehudah Yudel Rosenberg

Rabbi Yehudah Yudel Rosenberg (1859-1935) noted rabbi, author and Jewish communal leader in Poland and Canada.

Early Life.
Rabbi Yehuda Yudel Rosenberg was born on November 8, 1859 in Skaraschev, Poland near Radomsko, Poland. As a young boy, he was known as “the genius of Skaraschev”.

At age 17, he married Chaya Chava, the daughter of Shlomo Elimelech, of Tarlow, Poland, granddaughter of the Otrovtzer Rav, Rabbi Liebish Zucker and great-grandchild of the Ostrovtzer Rebbe.

After receiving his rabbinic designation, he became a Rabbi in <a href="Tarlow">Tarlow</a>, Poland, and was known in Poland as Rav Yudel Tarlow’er. The famous Talmudist, the “Pnei Yehoshua”, also lived in Tarlow some two centuries prior.

Move to Canada.
In 1913, Rosenberg moved to Canada, where he became the spiritual leader of Toronto’s Beth Jacob Congregation, which was founded in 1899 by a group of Polish-born Jews. He became known as the “Poilisher Rebbe” as opposed to other rabbis from different European origins (such as the “Galitzianer Rev” and the “Russian Rebbe” .)

During his close to six year in the city, Rosenberg founded the Eitz Chaim Talmud Torah on D’Arcy Street, in a building which once was an Italian club. <a href="Eitz%20Chaim%20Schools">Eitz Chaim Schools</a>, which still functions today, recently celebrated its 100th anniversary.

Rosenberg moved to Montreal in 1919, where he became the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations, a group of synagogues serving immigrant Ashkenazi communities and vice-chairman of the Jewish Community’s Rabbinic Council, which he served as until his death in Montreal at age seventy-five. He passed away on October 23, 1935.

Rosenberg’s grandson was the celebrated Montreal author <a href="Mordecai%20Richler">Mordecai Richler</a>.

Works.
Rabbi Rosenberg was a prolific author. His writing ranged from an anthology of the sciences (Sefer ha-Berit) - which was a source of scientific knowledge for Jews unfamiliar with European languages – to a Hebrew translation of the Zohar (his most important work), which he hoped would revive interest in Kabbalah, to numerous halakhic works.

He is perhaps most famous for his stories about the <a href="Golem">Golem</a> of Prague, which he attributed to the Maharal of Prague. However, many contemporary scholars suggest that in reality it was the work of Rosenberg’s own imagination.

Eliza Rickman

Eliza Rickman is an <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="independent%20music">indie</a> singer, songwriter, and pianist from <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a>. She is best known for her use of unconventional musical instruments, such as the <a href="toy%20piano">toy piano</a>, and her vintage Victorian Era dresses, as well as her collaborations with the podcast <a href="Welcome%20to%20Night%20Vale">Welcome to Night Vale</a> and musician <a href="Jason%20Webley">Jason Webley</a>.

Early Life.
Eliza Rickman was born on August 17, 1983 in <a href="Okinawa%2C%20Japan">Okinawa, Japan</a>. Her father was in the military, and then became a <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> preacher, while her mother is a secretary at the same church. She started to play piano at the age of eight.

Rickman attended the College of Music and the Arts at the Evangelical University <a href="Azusa%20Pacific%20University">Azusa Pacific University</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a>, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in music and orchestration, with her primary focus on piano performance. Her original intention was to be a concert pianist, and she had never previously considered a career as a singer-songwriter. Rickman previously thought herself unable to sing, but due to curriculum requirements, she had to take a voice class, in which she was required to sing. Through this class a professor encouraged her to continue singing.

Career.
The lineup of her first band consisted of musicians she met through Azusa Pacific University, some of whom she met while attending college there, while others she met after graduation. Alex Russell, the violinist and professor at Azusa Pacific, started playing for Rickman after she graduated. After graduating, she began booking shows at various small venues, but found she attracted more of an audience in her street performances. In 2009, she recorded her first <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a>, entitled "Gild the Lily", which was recorded by one of Rickman’s frequent collaborators, <a href="Robert%20DeLong">Robert DeLong</a>, on his laptop in a haunted chapel. "Gild the Lily" was released on March 7, 2009. 

She primarily stayed and performed in Los Angeles, due to its prominence as a primary music scene. Owing to demands from fans, she sought to record and release a number of songs she had written and performed on a full-length <a href="Long%20Play">LP</a>. According to Rickman, she went through her favorite CDs and made a list of the engineers and producers and began contacting them. Since <a href="Andrew%20Bird">Andrew Bird</a> is among her favorite artists, his engineer Mark Greenberg was on the top of her list. Greenberg expressed interest in recording Rickman and her band. The majority of her first full-length album, entitled "O, You Sinners", was recorded in December 2011 and January 2012 in The Mayfair Recordings studio and JoyRide Studio of Mark Greenberg in <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a> "O, You Sinners" was released on March 6, 2012.

Following this, Rickman grew disheartened from not being able to secure industry attention, and after recording "O, You Sinners" in Chicago, she decided to “uproot” herself and begin a nomadic stage of her career. She gave up her home in Los Angeles, and even her beloved cat into the care of friends, to tour and perform at any venue she could secure, including house concerts, in order to build up a fan base. After six years of following this lifestyle, she has returned to Los Angeles and is working on touring more effectively.

In 2014, Eliza Rickman was invited to tour with <a href="Welcome%20to%20Night%20Vale">Welcome to Night Vale</a> to perform as the opening act and during ″the weather″ portion of their live shows. She performed “Cinnamon Bone” for the "The Librarian" tour (2014), and “Maker of My Sorrow” for "The Investigators" tour (2015). She also performed for ″the weather″ in the "Ghost Stories" tour (2016) and in the first half of the U.S. portion of the "All Hail" tour (2017). On April 15 2015, Rickman had her song “Pretty Little Head” featured as ″the weather″ on Welcome to Night Vale Episode 45 – “A Story About Them”.

Also in 2014, Rickman was invited by <a href="Jason%20Webley">Jason Webley</a>, a longtime friend of hers, to participate in a collaborative project called "<a href="Margaret%20%28album%29">Margaret</a>" (2014). Webley had grown interested in an unknown, nearly forgotten woman named Margaret Rucker, who was from his hometown of <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett, Washington</a>, and who wrote poetry and lived a tragic life. He asked Rickman, <a href="Jherek%20Bischoff">Jherek Bischoff</a>, <a href="Parenthetical%20Girls">Zac Pennington</a>, and several others to each write and record two songs about Margaret. Webley had chosen Rickman in particular due to her love of time-worn things, such as the scrapbook of Margaret Rucker that was found in the bottom of a dumpster by <a href="Chicken%20John">Chicken John</a> Rinaldi. Part of the arrangement was that Rickman would be allowed to use her songs from "Margaret", “Lark of My Heart” and “Maker of My Sorrow”, on her next album, "Footnotes for the Spring".

In 2015, Eliza Rickman announced that she would be releasing her second full-length LP, entitled "Footnotes for the Spring". Since the recording and release of "O, You Sinners", Rickman had undergone a great deal of stress and anxiety, resulting in health and neurological issues, from perpetually living on the road, as well as being in an abusive relationship, and misogyny from venue managers and audience members. "Footnotes for the Spring" was originally intended to be about the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">American South</a>, but owing to her experiences over the previous few years, the album’s content came to reflect more her life experiences. "Footnotes for the Spring" was primarily recorded and arranged by Jason Webley in his studio in <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett, Washington</a>, though much of the piano material was recorded at The Jackstraw Cultural Center in Seattle. The album was officially released on October 20, 2015.

Rickman announced in 2015 that she would be releasing an album composed of covers of various artists, entitled "The Fire Went Wild". The album art and photography has already been executed, along with much of the production and arrangement. A release date has yet to be announced. The album takes its name from a lyric in the <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a> and <a href="June%20Carter">June Carter</a> duet “<a href="Ring%20of%20Fire%20%28song%29">Ring of Fire</a>.”

Musical Style.
Due to her aesthetics, both in fashion and musically, Rickman has been regarded as being hard to classify. She does not feel that “singer songwriter” is a label that fits her. A term she prefers is “post-prince charming” or “the Disney princess who’s been through some shit.” For example, her song "Pretty Little Head" has been called “disconcerting,” “borderline childlike,” “subliminal peculiarity,” and “the feel of a nursery rhyme that’s just starting to teeter off the rails.”

Instruments.
Other than her standard piano, one of Rickman’s signature instruments is a <a href="toy%20piano">toy piano</a>. Her first toy piano was a 1960s′ Schoenhut, which was purchased for her by her mother at an antique store for her 23 birthday, though the signature pink piano used in live performances was a gift from the <a href="Schoenhut%20Piano%20Company">Schoenhut Piano Company</a>. The antique Schoenhut was purchased as a piece of furniture, but after growing tired of transporting a large keyboard to and from live performances, she opted to use the toy piano for small-venue shows, which was well-received by fans. She has since made the toy piano a staple of her live shows.

Another instrument Rickman commonly uses is the <a href="autoharp">autoharp</a>. Like her toy piano, her autoharp is antique, and she purchased it in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. She claims she originally started to play the <a href="autoharp">autoharp</a> because it made her look like a “damsel”, but has become a central instrument in her writing and performances.

Rickman and her band use and experiment with a variety of instruments, some of which are unconventional, such as wine or liquor bottles. Other instruments include the <a href="ukulele">ukulele</a> (which was introduced to her by Jason Webley), <a href="accordion">accordion</a>, <a href="pump%20organ">pump organ</a>, singing wine glasses, <a href="tambourine">tambourine</a>, <a href="ratchet%20%28instrument%29">ratchets</a>, childrens bells, <a href="kazoo">kazoo</a>, and other <a href="noisemaker">noisemaker</a>s.

Influences.
There are a number of musicians, performers, artists, and film directors that Eliza Rickman attributes as major influences on her music. Among the most influential are <a href="Siouxsie%20Sioux">Siouxsie Sioux</a>, <a href="Nick%20Cave">Nick Cave</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Bird">Andrew Bird</a>, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <a href="Rufus%20Wainwright">Rufus Wainwright</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a>, <a href="Patsy%20Cline">Patsy Cline</a>, <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a>, <a href="%C3%89dith%20Piaf">Édith Piaf</a>, <a href="Kate%20Bush">Kate Bush</a>, <a href="Echo%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Bunnymen">Echo & the Bunnymen</a>, <a href="Bryan%20Ferry">Bryan Ferry</a>, and the <a href="Cocteau%20Twins">Cocteau Twins</a>, along with <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> and <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a> as non-musical inspirations.

Contributing Musicians.
Eliza Rickman works with a number of musical artists on her albums and occasionally in live performances. The following are a few of those musicians:

Analysis.

The <a href="Prelude%20%28music%29">prelude</a> is a lively 2 part texture, using a series of <a href="Broken%20chord">broken chords</a> which swap between the hands. It is in a fast 3/8 <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a> and is made up largely of <a href="semiquavers">semiquavers</a>. Later on in the piece, the semiquaver line splits between the hands before ending with a short <a href="codetta">Coda</a> in an improvisatory manner.
