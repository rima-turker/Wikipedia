Joanna Maria Vandenberg

Joanna (Joka) Maria Vandenberg (born 1938) is a Dutch <a href="Solid-state%20chemistry">solid state</a> <a href="chemist">chemist</a> and <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">crystallographer</a> who immigrated to the Unites States in 1968. At <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Laboratories">Bell Telephone Laboratories</a>, she made a major contribution to the success of the Internet. She invented, developed, and applied the <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> scanning tool for quality control essential to manufacturing <a href="indium%20gallium%20arsenide%20phosphide">indium gallium arsenide phosphide</a>-based multi-<a href="quantum%20well">quantum well</a> <a href="laser">laser</a>s. These are the lasers that amplify and modulate light that travels through <a href="optical%20fiber">optical fiber</a>s that are at the heart of today's <a href="Internet">Internet</a>.

Early life.
Joanna Vandenberg was born January 24, 1938 in <a href="Heemstede">Heemstede</a>, a small town near <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, where she was the youngest of a family of five, and the first one to go to college. Her family was in the <a href="tulip">tulip</a> business. In 1956 she graduated <a href="Cum%20Laude">Cum Laude</a> from <a href="gymnasium%20%28school%29">gymnasium</a>-β and went to the <a href="State%20University%20of%20Leiden">State University of Leiden</a> in the Netherlands where she received a B.S. in Physical Sciences and Mathematics, 1959 and a M.S. in Inorganic and Solid State Chemistry with <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Arkel">A. E. van Arkel</a> as well as Theoretical Chemistry, 1962. She studied with van Arkel in Leiden and <a href="Caroline%20H.%20MacGillavry">Caroline H. MacGillavry</a> in Amsterdam for a Ph.D. thesis on <a href="X-ray%20diffraction">X-ray diffraction</a> analysis of <a href="metal">metal</a>–metal bonding in <a href="inorganic%20compound">inorganic compound</a>s, 1964.

Career.
She worked for 4 years (1964–1968) at <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a> laboratory in Amsterdam, where she joined the research group on catalytic properties of <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>-layered <a href="chalcogenide">chalcogenide</a>s. In 1968 she moved to <a href="Bell%20Laboratories">Bell Laboratories</a> where she continued work on structural and magnetic properties of transition-metal chalcogenides. Her career was interrupted when she was laid off seven months into her first pregnancy. She was rehired in 1972 after the <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a> operators won a <a href="historic%20class%20action%20lawsuit">historic class action lawsuit</a> for being fired when pregnant. With <a href="Bernd%20Matthias">Bernd Matthias</a> of <a href="UCSD">UCSD</a>, she started to work on metal cluster formation in superconducting ternary transition metal compounds. Her extensive knowledge of structural inorganic chemistry enabled her to predict inorganic crystal structures and led to the discovery the superconducting <a href="rare%20earth%20element">rare earth</a> <a href="ternary%20boride">ternary boride</a>s.

In 1980 she changed direction and began research on <a href="Metal%E2%80%93semiconductor%20junction">contact metallization</a> on <a href="InGaAsP">InGaAsP</a>/<a href="InP">InP</a> multi-quantum well layers used as high speed digital lasers in the internet. She designed a temperature-dependent in-situ <a href="annealing%20%28metallurgy%29">annealing</a> <a href="X-ray%20diffractometer">X-ray diffractometer</a>. This technique made it possible to optimize the electrical behavior of the <a href="gold">gold</a> metallization contacts and became a standard reference in <a href="semiconductor%20industry">semiconductor industry</a>.

In 1986 Vandenberg turned her attention to the <a href="quality%20control">quality control</a> of the <a href="crystal%20growth">crystal growth</a> of InGaAsP multi-quantum well (MQW) layers, used as laser light sources and <a href="optical%20modulator">optical modulator</a>s designed to work in the 1.3 to 1.55 µm <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> range. Advancing the design, performance and manufacturability of these devices had been the focus of all the leading optical component suppliers for decades. These devices are manufactured using <a href="organometallic%20vapor%20phase%20epitaxy">organometallic vapor phase epitaxy</a>, a complex process involving multiple sources subject to drift. Manufacture of early devices was based on unacceptably low (much less than 1%) end-to-end yields. Dramatic improvement was needed to produce the high performance components used to transport the massive amounts of data in today's Internet. In many cases mono-layer thickness control is required along with variations in <a href="bandgap">bandgap</a> less than 0.5%. This high level of quality control must be achieved using complex crystal growth machines which can fail in hundreds of ways. To insure that these multiple failure modes do not impact the final device, Vandenberg designed a one-room (later bench-top) non-destructive high-resolution X-ray diffractometer to provide immediate on-line feedback into the MQW growth process. She constructed robust algorithms linking X-ray features to layer thickness and strain information essential to crystal growth control and optoelectronic device performance. Her X-ray diffraction technique was successfully deployed in a manufacturing environment. All Internet lasers are now manufactured using her tool <a href="X-Ray%20Crystallography">X-Ray Crystallography</a>, and their operational lifetime exceeds 25 years.

Awards.
Vandenberg received the 1995 and 1997 <a href="Optoelectronics%20Award">Optoelectronics Award</a> in recognition of contributions to the development of characterization and process control routines for manufacture of <a href="Lucent">Lucent</a>'s world class <a href="semiconductor%20laser">semiconductor laser</a>s.
She is a fellow of the <a href="American%20Physical%20Society">American Physical Society</a> and a corresponding member of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>.

Christine Ross Barker

Christine Ross Barker (2 January 1866-25 June 1940) was a Canadian pacifist and suffragist, active in the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>. She was a member of the <a href="Georgism">Georgist Movement</a>, serving as president of the Women's Henry George League in Manhattan and was one of the founders and first president of the radical <a href="Women%27s%20Peace%20Union">Women's Peace Union</a>. 

Early life.
Christine Ross was born on 2 January 1866 in <a href="Little%20Bras%20d%27Or">Little Bras d'Or</a> on <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Island">Cape Breton Island</a>, <a href="Nova%20Scotia%2C%20Canada">Nova Scotia, Canada</a> to Christina Isabella (née MacKay/McKay) and John Ross. Little is known of her early life, but she moved to New York City and married Wesley E. Barker on 23 December 1903 in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Barker was the son of Hersey (née Knowlton) and Wesley E. Barker, Sr. of <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield, Massachusetts</a>. Her husband, known as "Will" was a journalist and a member of the Manhattan Single Tax Club. In 1905 in Manhattan, the couple had a daughter, <a href="Mary%20Ross%20Barker">Mary Ross Barker</a>, who would later become an educator and be honored with the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a>.

Career.
Barker became involved in the <a href="women%27s%20suffrage%20movement">women's suffrage movement</a> as well as the <a href="Georgism">Women's Henry George League</a> (WHGL) of Manhattan. By 1904, she was speaking on behalf of the league, making presentations with <a href="Carrie%20Chapman%20Catt">Carrie Chapman Catt</a> and <a href="Maud%20Nathan">Maud Nathan</a>. By 1905, she had become president of the WHGL, whose object was to replace all forms of taxation with a single tax on resources, i.e. a form of <a href="ground%20rent">ground rent</a>. She participated in the Progressive Women's Suffrage Union's Parade on <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> in Manhattan in 1908, and was one of the members of the organization's executive board. Around 1910, the family moved to <a href="North%20Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">North Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> and the following year, they returned to Canada, moving to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. As she had in the United States, Barker became involved in suffragist causes, joining the <a href="Canadian%20Woman%20Suffrage%20Association">Canadian Woman Suffrage Association</a>. 

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Barker broke ranks with the business women's club in Toronto, which she headed, because they favored war. Instead, she actively supported the women meeting at <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>, who would form the <a href="Women%27s%20International%20League%20for%20Peace%20and%20Freedom">Women's International League for Peace and Freedom</a> (WILPF). Though a member of WILPF, Barker felt that they lacked resolve to maintain the fight as pacifists and made compromises for the war by buying <a href="war%20bond">war bond</a>s, knitting goods and wrapping bandages. When in 1921, Barker proposed that conference be held in <a href="Niagara%2C%20Ontario">Niagara, Ontario</a> between American and Canadian women to discuss their pacifist aims, she approached the <a href="Women%27s%20Peace%20Society">Women's Peace Society</a> (WPS) rather than WILPF to help her organize it. The WPS had split from the WILPF over the same lack of commitment to the cause that troubled Barker. Out of the conference, held between 19 and 21 August, came the creation of the <a href="Women%27s%20Peace%20Union">Women's Peace Union</a>, to unite women from Canada, <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> and the United States to work for peace. Barker served as the first chair, along with Margaret Long Thomas of New York City, who was appointed secretary, and <a href="Gertrude%20Franchot%20Tone">Gertrude Franchot Tone</a> of <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Niagara Falls, New York</a>, who served as treasurer. The single-purpose of the organization was to pass a <a href="constitutional%20amendment">constitutional amendment</a> in the United States to outlaw war.

In September 1927, Barker was one of the featured speakers at the Henry George Congress, held in New York City. She not only participated in the Congresses of the society, attending 1934, 1936, and 1938 meetings, but was actively involved in the Henry George School in Toronto. Her husband died on 26 June 1936 two weeks after they had attended the 1936 School Dinner in New York City.

Death and legacy.
Barker died on 25 June 1940 in <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London, Ontario</a>, Canada and was buried in Brookside Cemetery, <a href="New%20Glasgow%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">New Glasgow</a>, <a href="Pictou%20County%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Pictou County, Nova Scotia</a>.

The Works of Alan Watts

Introduction.
<a href="Alan%20Watts">Alan Watts</a> was an <a href="orator">orator</a> and <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> of the 20th century. He spent time reflecting on <a href="Personal%20Identity">Personal Identity</a> and <a href="Higher%20Consciousness">Higher Consciousness</a>. According to the critic Erik Davis, his "writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanising lucidity."These works are not accessible in the same way as his many books. 

Lectures.
The following lectures can all be obtained at alanwatts.org<a href="http%3A//www.alanwatts.org"></a>.

Is this life a dream?
Watts proposes a <a href="Thought%20experiment">thought experiment</a> of imagining that one has total control over the content of each night's dreams. He uses this thought experiment to make a case for the self as the ultimate reality.

What if Money were no object?
Watts argues that there is less difference than generally supposed between what one would want to do if money were no object, and what one should do under actual circumstances. He proposes that the question "What do I desire?" should be given greater emphasis, even under actual circumstances.

The mind.
Watts makes a case for quieting the mind by leaving it alone. He argues that we are "addicted to thoughts" and want to avoid ourselves, and that this quest for self-avoidance leads to a "vicious circle" of worry.

Royal Diamond

Royal Diamond (foaled 9 February 2006) is an Irish-bred <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> racehorse. A slow maturing stayer who was gelded before he appeared on a racecourse, he passed through the hands of five different trainers in a track career which lasted from September 2008 until November 2014. He won several minor races as a three-year-old in 2009 but then lost his form and failed to win in the next two seasons, including and unsuccessful stint as a <a href="National%20Hunt">National Hunt</a> horse. He finally emerged as a top-class performer at the age of six when he rebounded from an unlucky defeat in the <a href="Ebor%20Handicap">Ebor Handicap</a> to record an upset victory in the <a href="Irish%20St%20Leger">Irish St Leger</a>. He was at least as good in the following season when he won the <a href="Challenge%20Stakes%20%28Ireland%29">Challenge Stakes</a>, <a href="Irish%20St%20Leger%20Trial%20Stakes">Irish St Leger Trial Stakes</a> and <a href="British%20Champions%20Long%20Distance%20Cup">British Champions Long Distance Cup</a>. He was retired from racing after failing to win in 2014.

Background.
Royal Diamond is a bay gelding with two small white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">facial markings</a> bred in Ireland by the <a href="Moyglare%20Stud">Moyglare Stud</a>. As a <a href="yearling%20%28horse%29">yearling</a> he was consigned to the Goffs sale in October 2007 and was bought for €70,000 by the trainer Mark Prescott. He entered the ownership of E B Rimmer-Osborne House and was taken into training by Prescott as his Heath House Stable in <a href="Newmarket%2C%20Suffolk">Newmarket, Suffolk</a>.

He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by <a href="King%27s%20Best">King's Best</a> who won the <a href="2000%20Guineas">2000 Guineas</a> in 2000. His other progeny included <a href="Workforce%20%28horse%29">Workforce</a>, <a href="Creachadoir">Creachadoir</a>, <a href="Proclamation%20%28horse%29">Proclamation</a>, Eishin Flash (<a href="Tokyo%20Yushun">Tokyo Yushun</a>, <a href="Tenno%20Sho">Tenno Sho</a>), Sajjhaa (<a href="Dubai%20Duty%20Free%20Stakes">Dubai Duty Free Stakes</a>) and King's Apostle (<a href="Prix%20Maurice%20de%20Gheest">Prix Maurice de Gheest</a>). His dam Irresistible Jewel was a top-class racemare who won the <a href="Ribblesdale%20Stakes">Ribblesdale Stakes</a> in 2002 and went on to become a very successful broodmare whose other foals have included Princess Highway (Ribblesdale Stakes) and Mad About You (<a href="Gladness%20Stakes">Gladness Stakes</a>). She was descended from the British broodmare Fictitious (foaled 1957) whose other descendants included <a href="Blushing%20John">Blushing John</a>.

Royal Diamond was <a href="gelded">gelded</a> in February 2008, before the start of his racing career.

Racing career.
2008 – 2011: early career.
Royal Diamond showed little promise as two-year-old. After finishing fourth in a <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> at <a href="Yarmouth%20Racecourse">Yarmouth Racecourse</a> on 17 September he ran unplaced in similar events at <a href="Warwick%20Racecourse">Warwick</a> and <a href="Lingfield%20Park">Lingfield</a>.

After finishing last of nine on his three-year-old debut, the gelding was moved up in distance and produced a much better effort when finishing second in a <a href="Handicap%20%28horse%20racing%29">handicap</a> over fourteen furlongs at <a href="Haydock%20Park">Haydock Park</a>. On 29 July at <a href="Sandown%20Park%20Racecourse">Sandown Park Racecourse</a> Royal Diamond was assigned a weight of 123 pounds in a handicap and recorded his first success as he won by two and a half lengths at odds of <a href="Fractional%20odds">6/1</a>. The gelding remained unbeaten for the rest of the 2009 season, although his campaign was restricted to minor handicaps over extended distances: he won at Yarmouth in August, <a href="Ffos%20Las">Ffos Las</a> in September and <a href="Wolverhampton%20Racecourse">Wolverhmpton</a> in October. At the end of October Royal Diamond was put up for auction at <a href="Tattersalls">Tattersalls</a> and was sold for 400,000 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> to the trainer Michael Dods. The horse passed into the ownership of Andrew Tinkler and joined Dods' stable at <a href="Denton%2C%20County%20Durham">Denton, County Durham</a>.

Royal Diamond's time at Dods' stable in 2010 proved to be extremely disappointing as he finished unplaced in all four of his races. In 2011 the gelding was transferred to the stable of <a href="Jonjo%20O%27Neill">Jonjo O'Neill</a> who prepared the horse for a <a href="National%20Hunt">National Hunt</a> campaign. After recording one third place from three runs on the flat in the early part of 2011 Royal Diamond was switched to <a href="Hurdling%20%28horse%20race%29">Hurdling</a> but appeared to show little aptitude for the sport. He fell on his jumping debut at <a href="Huntingdon%20Racecourse">Huntingdon Racecourse</a> and was well beaten in two subsequent appearances over obstacles.

2012: six-year-old season.
For the 2012 Flat season, Royal Diamond was moved to Ireland and joined the stable of the former <a href="steeplechase">steeplechase</a> jockey Tommy Carmody at the <a href="Curragh">Curragh</a> in <a href="County%20Kildare">County Kildare</a>. After finishing third in a minor race at <a href="Dundalk%20Racecourse">Dundalk</a> he recorded his first win in two and a half years when he was ridden to victory by <a href="Johnny%20Murtagh">Johnny Murtagh</a> in a handicap at <a href="Leopardstown%20Racecourse">Leopardstown</a> on 15 April. He was then moved up in class, finishing second in a valuable handicap at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh</a> in May and third in the <a href="Ulster%20Derby">Ulster Derby</a> in June. In August the gelding was sent to England for the <a href="Ebor%20Handicap">Ebor Handicap</a> at <a href="York%20Racecourse">York Racecourse</a> in which he carried a weight of 126 pounds and started at odds of 16/1. After disputing the lead for most of the way he was beaten a neck by the <a href="Godolphin%20Racing">Godolphin</a> representative Willing Foe after being badly hampered as the winner hung to the left in the closing stages.

Royal Diamond made his first appearance in a <a href="Group%20race">Group race</a> on 15 September when he started a 16/1 outsider for the Group One Irish St Leger over fourteen furlongs on <a href="Going%20%28horse%20racing%29">yielding</a> ground at the Curragh. <a href="Fame%20and%20Glory">Fame and Glory</a> started favourite ahead of <a href="Brown%20Panther">Brown Panther</a> while the other runners included Hartani (<a href="Curragh%20Cup">Curragh Cup</a>), Aiken (<a href="Grand%20Prix%20de%20Chantilly">Grand Prix de Chantilly</a>), Massiyn (second in the <a href="Ballyroan%20Stakes">Ballyroan Stakes</a>) and Simenon (<a href="Queen%20Alexandra%20Stakes">Queen Alexandra Stakes</a>). Fame and Glory set a steady pace with Royal Diamond, partnered by Niall McCullagh, settled in fourth place in the early stages before moving into contention approaching the final turn. Fame and Glory went clear of the field in the straight but then began to struggle as Massiyn, Brown Panther, Aiken and Royal Diamond all stayed on strongly. In a "blanket finish" Royal Diamond gained the advantage in the final stride and won by a head, a short head and a neck from Massiyn, Brown Panther and Aiken. After the race McCullagh said "This is what all the early mornings and hard work is for. My initial plan was to get cover and sit fourth but he ran keen and down the straight he came alive. I knew he'd finish well after riding him in the Ebor. He battled all the way to the line and he never flinched. I had an inkling that maybe I might have just got there and I was relieved when the result was called".

2013: seven-year-old season.
In early 2013, Royal Diamond was sent to the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> and ran twice at <a href="Meydan%20Racecourse">Meydan Racecourse</a> in March, making little impact as he ran unplaced in the <a href="Nad%20Al%20Sheba%20Trophy">Nad Al Sheba Trophy</a> and the <a href="Sheema%20Classic">Sheema Classic</a>. On his returen to Europe in May he produced a slighly better effort as he came home third behind Glen's Diamond and Top Trip in the <a href="Yorkshire%20Cup%20%28horse%20race%29">Yorkshire Cup</a>. A week after his run at York, Royal Diamond changed trainers yet again, moving to the recently established stable of Johnny Murtagh at Coolaghknock Glebe, <a href="County%20Kildare">County Kildare</a>. Murtagh both trained and rode the horse in his remaining six races that year.

Royal Diamond was beaten five lengths into second by the <a href="Aidan%20O%27Brien">Aidan O'Brien</a>-trained Ernest Hemingway in the Curragh Cup in June and was then dropped in class for the Listed Challenge Stakes at <a href="Leopardstown%20Racecourse">Leopardstown Racecourse</a> in July. Starting the 5/4 favourite he took the lead from the start, opened up a clear lead, and won by three and three quarter lengths from Sir Ector despite being eased down by Murtagh in the closing stages. On 8 August in the Ballyroan Stakes he was again beaten by Ernest Hemingway but on this occasion he finished only half a length behind the O'Brien colt. In the <a href="Irish%20St%20Leger%20Trial%20Stakes">Irish St Leger Trial Stakes</a> sixteen days later he faced Ernest Hemingway yet again in a five-runner field which also included Sir Ector and the improving four-year-old filly <a href="Voleuse%20de%20Coeurs">Voleuse de Coeurs</a>. Murtagh sent the gelding into the lead from the start and Royal Diamond held off a sustained challenge from Voleuse de Coeurs to win by half a length, with Ernest Hemingway finishing five and a half lengths back in third place. Johnny Murtagh commented "He's really come on from the last day. I tried to be a bit clever last time by going quick but not too quick in front. He comes good at this time of year. Hopefully in three weeks' time he'll come back here and defend his title. He's a wonderful horse for us to have".

On 15 September Royal Diamond attempted to reproduce his 2012 success in the Irish St Leger and started at odds of 9/2 in a ten-runner field. He led for most of the way but was outpaced in the straight and finished fifth behind Voleuse de Coeurs. The gelding ended his season with a run in the British Champions Long Distance Cup at <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Ascot Racecourse</a> on 19 October in which he started a 20/1 outsider. The field was headed by the <a href="Ascot%20Gold%20Cup">Ascot Gold Cup</a> winner <a href="Estimate%20%28horse%29">Estimate</a> and included several other top stayers including Saddler's Rock (<a href="Goodwood%20Cup">Goodwood Cup</a>, <a href="Doncaster%20Cup">Doncaster Cup</a>), Harris Tweed (<a href="John%20Porter%20Stakes">John Porter Stakes</a>) Ahzeemah (<a href="Lonsdale%20Cup">Lonsdale Cup</a>) and Times Up (Doncaster Cup). In a tactical change, Murtagh restrained the horse in seventh place before making a forward move in the straight. He stayed on strongly in the closing stages, caught the leader Harris Tweed on the line and won by a nose. After the race Johnny Murtagh said "It's the best day of my life. I can't thank everyone enough for giving me the horses and trusting me. I don't know what to say - I'm stuck for words. He's been a brilliant horse from day one."

2014: eight-year-old season.
Royal Diamond remained in training as an eight-year-old but failed to win in five races. He finished second to <a href="Leading%20Light">Leading Light</a> in the <a href="Vintage%20Crop%20Stakes">Vintage Crop Stakes</a> and then ran unplaced behind the same horse in the Ascot Gold Cup. He was then beaten by Leading Light yet again when finishing second in the Irish St Leger Stakes. Royal Diamond made a third appearance in the Irish St Leger, finishing sixth to Brown Panther and was then sent to Australia for a run in the <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a>. He was made a 100/1 outsider and finished tailed off at the rear of the field.

Formerly known as <a href="Jean%20Goujon">Jean Goujon</a>'s work, it is now thought more likely to have been the work of <a href="Germain%20Pilon">Germain Pilon</a> or someone else (see below).

Description.
The goddess of hunting Diana is represented with two dogs (a greyhound and a water spaniel named Phrocyon and Cyrius) and with a big stag. This silhouette is one of the symbols of the French Renaissance. It isn't the true portrait of Diane de Poitiers but one of the many images of moon goddesses closely related (paintings "Diana the Huntress" by a School of Fontainebleau, "Le Bain de Diane" by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Clouet">François Clouet</a>, etc.).

This sculpture was a part of the fountain in <a href="Diane%20de%20Poitiers">Diane de Poitiers</a>'s <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Anet">Château d'Anet</a> built by <a href="Philibert%20de%20L%27Orme">Philibert de L'Orme</a>.

The Flintstones (1988 video game)

The Flintstones is a video game based on the 1960s <a href="The%20Flintstones">television series of the same name</a>. The game was developed by Teque Software Development and published by <a href="Grandslam%20Interactive">Grandslam Entertainments</a>. The game was released in Europe in 1988, for <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a>, <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a>, <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a>, <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, <a href="MSX">MSX2</a>, and <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>. A version for the Sega <a href="Master%20System">Master System</a> was released in 1991.

Gameplay.
Each version of "The Flintstones" features identical gameplay. The game contains four levels. The story begins with <a href="Fred%20Flintstone">Fred Flintstone</a> finishing work at a rock quarry and exclaiming "Yabba dabba doo!" which is the game's only spoken line of dialogue, achieved through <a href="speech%20synthesis">speech synthesis</a>. For the remainder of the game, character interactions are done through <a href="speech%20balloon">speech balloon</a>s.

Fred wants to bowl with <a href="Barney%20Rubble">Barney Rubble</a> at a bowling alley, but Fred's wife, <a href="Wilma%20Flintstone">Wilma</a>, tells him that he must paint their living room first for the arrival of her mother. Playing as Fred, the player must paint the room while also preventing his young daughter, <a href="Pebbles%20Flintstone">Pebbles</a>, from scribbling on the walls. The player's paintbrush is a squirrel. When stopping Pebbles, the squirrel sometimes runs away and must be captured.

In the second level, Fred must race to the bowling alley while avoiding rocks on the road. Hitting a rock results in the vehicle losing a wheel, requiring the player to search for a replacement and get back on the road. The third level is played as a bowling game between Fred and Barney, with the two players taking turns. In the final level, Fred returns home and discovers that Pebbles is missing from the house. He finds her climbing a construction site and competes against Barney to rescue her, while avoiding nuts and bolts.

A practice mode allows the player to explore each area. A rendition of the theme music from the television series was created by <a href="Ben%20Daglish">Ben Daglish</a>, and is present throughout the game, except for the ZX Spectrum version.

Reception.
"<a href="The%20Games%20Machine">The Games Machine</a>" criticized the bowling level for "the long-winded restacking of the pins after each bowl – this is taking realism too far." The magazine praised the music and noted that the graphics "could challenge the TV cartoon", and concluded, "If you have the patience, The Flintstones could provide an amusing, if generally tough challenge." The magazine noted that the Atari ST version was identical to the Amiga version, except for slightly poorer sound.

Reviewing the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions, "The Games Machine" wrote that each version retained the "impressive cartoon-like" graphics and difficult gameplay of the earlier versions. The magazine wrote, "The Commodore version moves at a fair rate, while the Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions are slow enough to cause frustration."

Chris Jenkins of "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" praised the graphics and sound, but considered the bowling level to be the "poorest" portion of the game. Jenkins concluded that the game "is a polished and professional product which deserves to be seen." John Butters of "<a href="Atari%20ST%20User">Atari ST User</a>" praised the music and sound, and called the graphics "immaculate," but concluded that the game "soon became frustrating rather than addictive". Andy Richards, also of "Atari ST User", praised the music, sound, gameplay, and graphics.

One reviewer for "<a href="ST%20Action">ST Action</a>" wrote that the painting level "is clever, infuriating, and taxing, but the bowling scene could have been more thoughtfully designed." Another reviewer for "ST Action" wrote, "Sluggish controls and the slow speed make the painting scene unbelievably tedious and, sadly the bowling scene is, if anything, worse. A lot of time is wasted as the player resets the pins, or whilst Barney bowls, and this means just sitting and waiting until it is your turn again. There is nothing about this program I can recommend."

<a href="Paul%20Glancey">Paul Glancey</a> of "<a href="Zzap%2164">Zzap!64</a>" wrote about the Commodore 64 version, "Poor <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> and feeble backgrounds coupled with a grating rendition of the Flintstones theme tune create a bad impression, and frustrating controls in the painting section do not enthrall. The sub-games are dated – a paint and collect game in '88?! – and the basic Tenth Frame bowling doesn't encourage the player to reach the final section. TV licences work rarely, if at all; The Flintstones certainly doesn't." Paul Sumner, also of "Zzap!64", wrote that neither Fred or Barney resembled their television counterparts, but praised the sound and music. Sumner wrote that the gameplay "is a little difficult at first, due mainly to the slightly unresponsive control. But perseverance does reap some reward, though I personally found the game to be too difficult to warrant extensive play."

Joseph Toyn

Joseph Toyn (28 September 1838 – 27 January 1924) was a <a href="British%20people">British</a> <a href="trade%20unionist">trade unionist</a>.

Born in <a href="Tattershall">Tattershall</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, Toyn worked as a bird-scarer on a farm from the age of six. After a variety of other farm work, when he was fourteen, he began working on a canal barge, then three years later became an ironstone miner in <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>. After some time, he was promoted to become an overman, but soon resigned to work underground again.

In 1872, Toyn was a founder of the <a href="Cleveland%20Miners%27%20Association">Cleveland Miners' Association</a>, serving as a delegate from his mine, then in 1875 he became the union's president. The following year, the union appointed him as its full-time agent. As agent, he was the leading figure in setting up a conciliation board to resolve disputes in the industry, which he credited with preventing any strikes during his time in office.

Through his work for the union, Toyn regularly attended the <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">Trades Union Congress</a>, and also served on the board of the <a href="Miners%27%20National%20Union">Miners' National Union</a> (MNU). However, in 1892, he persuaded the union to leave the MNU and instead affiliated to the rival <a href="Miners%27%20Federation%20of%20Great%20Britain">Miners' Federation of Great Britain</a> (MFGB). This federation was campaigning for an eight-hour maximum working day, an issue which Toyn strongly supported.

Toyn was elected to the executive of the MFGB in 1896, but served only a single year. He also became active in the <a href="Labour%20Electoral%20Association">Labour Electoral Association</a>, which proposed him as a <a href="Liberal-Labour%20%28UK%29">Liberal-Labour</a> candidate in the <a href="Cleveland%20by-election%2C%201902">Cleveland by-election, 1902</a>.

Ultimately, Toyn decided not to run.

Toyn was appointed as a <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a> in 1906, and was also prominent in the local <a href="co-operative%20movement">co-operative movement</a> and as a <a href="Primitive%20Methodist">Primitive Methodist</a> <a href="lay%20preacher">lay preacher</a>.

NGC 5281

NGC 5281 is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> in the constellation <a href="Centaurus%20%28constellation%29">Centaurus</a>. It was discovered by <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> in 1751-1752 from <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, and catalogued it as Lacaille I.7. NGC 5281 is located three and a quarter degrees southwest of <a href="Beta%20Centauri">Beta Centauri</a>. Under dark skies, it is bright enough to be spotted with <a href="naked%20eye">naked eye</a>, appearing as a 6th magnitude star.

Characteristics.
The four bright stars of the cluster form a striking line as seen from Earth, however the cluster is sparsely populated. The brightest member of the cluster is of mag 6.61. The next two brighter stars have evolved away from <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>. The <a href="Turnoff%20point">turn-off mass</a> of the cluster is estimated to be at 5.6 . Based on the colour magnitude diagram, the age of the cluster is estimated to be 45 myrs. The tidal radius of the cluster is 5.5 - 8.4 parsecs (18 - 27 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 5281, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. The radius of the core of the cluster is about 4.3 light years, nearly the same as the distance between the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> and the closest star system, <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a>. Within the angular radius of the cluster there are 371 probable members.

One of the members of the cluster is HD 119682 (mag. 7.97, spectral type B0.5V), a <a href="Be%20star">Be star</a> notable for its <a href="X-rays">X-rays</a> emission. It has been categorised by Moffat & Vogt (1973), Mermilliod (1982), and Safi-Harb (2007), as a <a href="blue%20straggler">blue straggler</a>, and it has also been categorised as a <a href="gamma%20Cassiopeiae">gamma Cassiopeiae</a> analog. HD 119682 has been identified as the visual counterpart of the X-ray source 1WGA J1346.5-6255, found within the radio lobes of the <a href="supernova%20remnant">supernova remnant</a> G309.2-00.6, located 4 ± 2 kpc away, with which it is unrelated. The <a href="light%20curve">light curve</a> of the star in X-rays shows significant brightness variations within hours, however, the spectral distribution appears rather stable. The spectrum obtained by the High Energy Transmission Gratings on board <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> seems to lack strong <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s, including Fe Kα <a href="X-ray%20fluorescence">fluorescence</a>.

Laurie Brokenshire

<a href="Commodore%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Commodore</a> Laurence Phillip Brokenshire <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a>, <a href="Royal%20Navy">RN</a> (1952-2017), known universally as Laurie Brokenshire, was a man of many talents. 

History.
Laurie was born on 20 October 1952 at 40 Amherst Road, <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> to Martin Brokenshire (1926-97) and his wife Pansy Jeanne (Pam) née Hewitt (1930-2007). He had a younger sister Lynnette, and younger brother Adrian. His early hobby interests included chess, puzzles and magic. In 1964, he joined <a href="Devonport%20High%20School%20for%20Boys">Devonport High School for Boys</a>. In 1966, following the completion of his father's naval career, the family moved to <a href="Slough">Slough</a> where Brokenshire joined <a href="Upton%20Court%20Grammar%20School%23Slough%20Grammar%20School%20for%20Boys%20%281936-82%29">Slough Grammar School</a>, nowadays Upton Court Grammar School. He played for Buckinghamshire junior hockey. In later years, he managed the School chess club and, jointly, the School bridge club (which notably beat <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> on one occasion). After school, he went to the <a href="University%20of%20Exeter">University of Exeter</a> (1971-74) where he took a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">BSc</a> degree in Mathematics, graduating in 1974. He played hockey and table tennis for University teams, and turned down the offer of a place in the Bridge team. During this time, he beat his Head of Department, Professor <a href="David%20Rees%20%28mathematician%29">David Rees</a>, at both chess and, at Rees' insistence, <a href="Go%20%28game%29">Go</a>. 

After taking a <a href="Postgraduate%20Certificate%20in%20Education">PGCE</a> in 1975, Brokenshire joined the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> as an Instructor - his father's career and service branch. After subsequent postings to <a href="Britannia%20Royal%20Naval%20College">Dartmouth</a>, <a href="Admiralty%23The%20Admiralty">Westminster</a>, <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Plymouth</a>, <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and <a href="HMNB%20Clyde">Faslane</a>, Brokenshire's career developed as a submariner and later as a senior Royal Navy officer. He took a second degree, this time an <a href="Open%20University">Open University</a> <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">BA</a> degree in science. As longstanding Royal Navy chess champion, he represented the RN at the NATO Chess championship several years running, creating for himself an international standing in Chess. In later years, he commanded two shore establishments: <a href="Northwood%20Headquarters">Northwood</a> and, as a <a href="Commodore%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Commodore</a>, <a href="HMS%20Raleigh%20%28shore%20establishment%29">HMS Raleigh</a> - the Navy's main Torpoint training centre - the family lived at nearby Trevol House. In 2003, on the occasion of his retirement, he was awarded a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> for services rendered.

Sea Cadets.
Following the end of his Royal Navy career, Brokenshire was appointed as Commodore of the <a href="Sea%20Cadet%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">UK Sea Cadet Corps</a>. As such, he toured and inspected as many local associations as he could. On one such visit to Essex, he met his 7th cousin and fellow Exeter-graduate, the local MP <a href="James%20Brokenshire">James Brokenshire</a>, and remained in regular contact.

Magic.
Brokenshire was accepted into the <a href="Inner%20Magic%20Circle">Inner Magic Circle</a>, and became an occasional professional / semi-professional magic performer. He was regularly used by his charities as a high-profile magic performer, in particular, performing table magic for members of the British Royal Family at various charitable occasions. He was always able to find a suitable magic trick for any occasion, particularly for young children, and carried his "magic" bag with him at all times.

Puzzling.
In his spare time, Brokenshire became a world-class puzzling expert. Specialising in combinatorial puzzles, he was in regular contact with puzzle designers and other puzzle specialists around the world. He introduced some novel solutions to existing problems, and was exceptionally quick to solve new problems. He was retained by a number of major puzzles companies as a consultant to offer an assessment on the viability of proposed puzzles. His personal puzzle collection was considered among the two or three largest in the UK. He organized and held <a href="Gathering%204%20Gardner">Gathering 4 Gardner</a> meetings at his house.

Historically, the famous puzzlist <a href="Henry%20Dudeney">Henry Dudeney</a> (1857-1930) announced a particularly-difficult chessboard (aka checkerboard) dissection puzzle in one of his first puzzle books and asserted that it had a "unique" solution. Numerous people tried and failed to solve this puzzle, such that it became famously known as the "Dudeney Problem". True to his word, Dudeney's "unique" solution was subsequently given in one of his last puzzle books. Still later, <a href="Sam%20Loyd">Sam Loyd</a> (1841-1911) asserted his own abilities, and disproved Dudeney's assertion of uniqueness, by giving a second "unique" solution in one of his puzzle books. The famous problem became known as the "Dudeney-Loyd problem". Today, that same problem is classified as the "Dudeney-Loyd-Brokenshire problem" when Brokenshire found the third "unique" solution, after a gap of about 100 years. Substantial further analysis has shown that there were only ever 3 solutions. For this reason, at the very least, Brokenshire Brokenshire is present in the puzzling record books, and is in illustrious company.

International Puzzle Parties.
In recent years, Brokenshire and Ethel camped and bicycled the length of several continents to reach successive annual International Puzzle Parties (IPP). Taking two bicycles, two panniers and a magic bag, they cycled and either wild-camped or stayed with friends along the Eastern coast of Australia, around the North Island of New Zealand, Japan, Europe and Scandinavia, and various ways across the USA from Alaska to Washington, DC. 

Brokenshire organised one of the most recent UK IPP puzzle parties.

Fostering.
Since 1994, Brokenshire and Ethel undertook fostering within Hampshire. They successfully fostered over 70 children in 22 years. 

Religion.
Brokenshire was a member of the Navy Christian Fellowship and was a pillar of his local Church. 

Sea swimming.
In 1986, Brokenshire swam the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. Subsequently, his son Matthew has also swum the Channel - making them one of the few father and son pairs who have achieved this feat. In later years, Brokenshire enjoyed sea swimming throughout the year with his local "Shack Sharks" club, and represented his locality at cold water swimming competitions up and down the country.

Family.
Brokenshire married Ethel Isobel McMahon (1954-) (<a href="Women%27s%20Royal%20Naval%20Service">WRNS</a>) on 29 March 1980 at <a href="Clonallan">Clonallon</a> Parish Church, with 4 children:

and 5 grandchildren. Through his Tremain(e) ancestry, a branch of the Brokenshire surname, he had a direct royal ancestral line.

Illness and death.
In early 2016, Brokenshire was diagnosed with <a href="GBM">terminal brain cancer</a>, which had overtaken his father some 20 years earlier. His response was immediate and typical - his family undertook a 30-mile sea swim off Plymouth in aid of various cancer charities, raising over £30,000 in under 3 weeks, and in excess of £45,000 overall. . 

On 4 August 2017, Brokenshire died at home surrounded by all his family. On 18 August, following a Thanksgiving service, attended by 500-1000 people, at <a href="Crofton%2C%20Hampshire">Crofton</a> Church, he was interred at Crofton Cemetery.

Chicago Talking Machine Company

The Chicago Talking Machine Company (sometimes The Talking Machine Company of Chicago, or simply The Talking Machine Company) was a manufacturer and dealer of phonographs, phonograph accessories, and phonograph records from 1892 until 1906, and a major wholesaler of Victor Talking Machine Company products between 1906 and at least 1928.

The company was founded in 1892 by <a href="Leon%20Douglass">Leon Douglass</a> and <a href="Henry%20Babson">Henry Babson</a>, with financing from Charles Dickinson. It first sold phonographs and supplies manufactured by the Edison Phonograph Works, but soon began manufacturing their own cylinder records and marketing a spring motor designed by <a href="Edward%20H.%20Amet">Edward H. Amet</a> . After the collapse of the <a href="North%20American%20Phonograph%20Company">North American Phonograph Company</a> in 1894, the company became a major independent distributor of phonograph records made by the <a href="Columbia%20Phonograph%20Company">Columbia Phonograph Company</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Phonograph%20Company">United States Phonograph Company</a>, and Edison's <a href="National%20Phonograph%20Company">National Phonograph Company</a>, in addition to those of their own manufacture. <a href="Silas%20Leachman">Silas Leachman</a>, a Chicago-based recording pioneer who specialized in <a href="Coon%20song">coon songs</a>, was their most popular artist. By the first issue of the trade magazine Phonoscope in November 1896, the company was in a prominent enough position in the industry to buy the first full-page advertisement of the issue. 

In 1898, Leon Douglass, who had previously invented a coin-operation mechanism and phonograph record duplication process, invented the "Polyphone", which added a second horn and reproducer to the phonograph or graphophone to increase its loudness (and, supposedly, its fidelity). He formed The Polyphone Company at the same address as The Talking Machine Company (having dropped the "Chicago" prefix) to market the device and would focus on this aspect of the business until joining <a href="Eldridge%20R.%20Johnson">Eldridge Johnson</a> in 1900 to begin working on what would become the <a href="Victor%20Talking%20Machine%20Company">Victor Talking Machine Company</a>. 

From 1903 until 1905, Henry Babson would manage the operation with his brothers Fred and Gus, and develop a mail-order operation and a national distribution network. In 1906, the company was purchased by Arthur D. Geissler, son of the general manager of the <a href="Victor%20Talking%20Machine%20Company">Victor Talking Machine Company</a> and reconfigured to wholesale Victor products, while the Babson Brothers formed a new company to sell and distribute Edison products.

Juellinge, prior to 1672 known as Valbygaard, is a manor house located on the Stevns Peninsula, <a href="Stevns%20Municipality">Stevns Municipality</a>, some 50 kilometres south of <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>. The <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a>-style main building and two buildings from the beginning of the 19th century have been listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the <a href="Danish%20Heritage%20Agency">Danish Heritage Agency</a>.
History.
Valbygård.
In the Middle Ages, Juellinge was called Valbygaard. The name indicates that it was then located in a village named Valby. It was a fairly insignificant manor which frequently changed hands and was rarely used as a residence by its owners. It is first mentioned in1387 as part of the estate after Jakob Olufsen Lunge. He had been one of the most trusted advisors of <a href="Margrethe%20I%20of%20Denmark">Margrethe I</a>. Jacobsen Lunge had no sons and Valbygaard was therefore passed on to his daughters Sophie and Regitze Lunge and later to their husbands Jens Andersen and Anders Nielsen Panter.
The next owner may have been Jep Knudsen, although his ownership is not confirmed until 1419. He was a member of the noble family Lille which resided on the neighbouring estate Anøje (Enøje). His son, Knud Jepsen, sold Valbygaard to Johan Bjørnsen Bjørn. Valbygaard was then passed on to his son-in-law, Christoffer Lindenov. After his death, Valbygaard was sold to Elsebe Svave. In 1606, he gave it to his daughter Ellen Juel. She brought it into possession of her later husband, Jens Bille. Admiral Herluf Daa acquired the estate some time before 1723. He died in 1630 and his widow Karen Grubbe then married Jens Bille's son Vincens Bille om 1631. He sold Valbygaard to Gunde Rosenkrantz in 1653. Rosenkrantz lived at Valbygaard with his family until 1657 but finally had to sell it due to economic problems. He fell out of facour at the court and fled to Sweden in 1664.
The Juel family.
The nexr owner was Ida Lunge. Her daughter Vibeke Lunge inherited Valbygaard in 1671 and married <a href="Jens%20Juel%20%28diplomat%29">Jens Juel</a> the following year. He was one of the most influential advisors of <a href="Christian%20V%20of%20Denmark">Christian V</a>. He changed its name into Juellinge and turned it into a barony in 1782. This meant that it could no longer be sold or divided between heirs. He also embrakred on a major renovation of the buildings which culminated with the construction of a new main building in 1675.

Juel had no sons to succeed him as Baron of Juellinge and the estate was therefore passed on to his son-in-law Frederik Vind in 1700 but he died just two years later. Gis son, Jens Juel-Vind, became a baron in 1708.

Later history.
In 1719, Juel-Vind ceded Juellinge to Frederick IV in exchange for <a href="Halsted%20Priory">Halsted Priory</a> on <a href="Lolland">Lolland</a>. Juellinge was initially included in the new <a href="Lille%20Heddinge%20Rytterskole">Rryggevælde Cacalry Fistrict</a>. In 1735, Frederick IV ceded Juellinge to <a href="Frederik%20Danneskiold-Sams%C3%B8e">Frederik Danneskiold-Samsøe</a> in exchange for another estate. In 1750, he sold it to <a href="Adam%20Gottlob%20Moltke">Adam Gottlob Moltke</a> who merged it into the countship of <a href="Bregentved">Bregentved</a>. Juellinge was part of Bregentved until 1922 when the countship was dissolved as a result of "lensafløsningsloven". The next owner was Christian Moltke. Later owners include A/S Premier Is, an icecream manufacturer. The company acquired the estate in 1848.

Architecture.
The <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a>-style main building stands in two-storeys towards the courtyard and three storeys towards the garden and was originally surrounded by moats. It is built in granite ashlars with a few chalk ashlars. The side that faces the courtyard building stands in blank wall with smooth finishing of the ashlars and has a strongly projecting <a href="Avant-corps">median risalit</a> with a portal flanked by <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s. The three other sides of the building hasa more rough finishing of the ashlars and are white-washed. The well-preserved red <a href="Mansard%20roof">Mansard roof</a> is topped by three chimneys. Rge symmetrical floor plan is centred on a large vestibule in the ground floor. The main entrance was adapted in 1901 and the building was refurbished in 1940.

To the north of the main building is a complex of farm buildings ("ladegården") which was originally centred on a rectangular courtyard but has seen many alterations over the years. The site also comprises two buildings from the beginning of the 19th century, one of them with exposed timber framing and two gateways, the other a brick building and both with half-hipped red, tile roofs. 

The main building and the two buildings from the beginning of the 19th century have been listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the <a href="Danish%20Heritage%20Agency">Danish Heritage Agency</a>.

<doc id="54909976" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54909976" title="Discrete complementary JFETS">
Discrete complementary JFETS

Discrete complementary JFETs are <a href="N-channel">N-channel</a> and <a href="P-channel">P-channel</a> <a href="JFET">JFET</a>s that are built with a similar process technology and are designed to have similar or matching electrical characteristics. Discrete complementary JFETs come in separate P and N-channel packages. Dual discrete complementary JFETS house two N-channel JFETs in one monolithic unit and two P-channel units in another monolithic unit. 

Because they are built on the same die, dual N-Channel JFETs have nearly equivalent or matched electrical characteristics. The same can be said for the dual P-Channel JFETs. Although, complementary P and N-Channels are built with the same process technology, because of basic differences between the construction of P and N channel devices, electrical specifications such as <a href="Electron%20mobility">mobility</a> and <a href="transconductance">transconductance</a> are slightly different for the P and N-Channel JFETs. , . 
The complementary and matched nature of the dual N-channel and dual P-channel JFETs is fundamental to the building of many <a href="analog%20circuit">analog circuit</a>s, most notably <a href="amplifier">amplifier</a>s. Specifically, <a href="complementary%20amplifier">complementary amplifier</a> topologies are based on a number of complementary matched JFET pairs. As one example, a fully complementary amplifier will use matched N and P-channel JFETs for the <a href="differential%20amplifier">differential amplifier</a> front end.

Other complementary and matched JFET blocks within complementary amplifiers include stacked and <a href="folded%20cascode%20block">folded cascode block</a>s and <a href="level%20translator">level translator</a>s (level shifters). .

<a href="Source%20follower">Source follower</a>s (buffers) are another complementary structure found in amplifiers. The complementary source follower, often used in the <a href="output%20stage">output stage</a> of an amplifier, can be designed such that it can adjust the output offset voltage to zero, effectively, eliminating the need for an AC coupling capacitor. 
A complementary source follower can also be paralleled to create power amplifiers. <a href="Nelson%20Pass">Nelson Pass</a> built such a design based on Toshiba’s 2SK170 and 2SJ74 single complementary JFETs with over 1000 paralled JFETs . Today though, since <a href="Toshiba">Toshiba</a> discontinued these parts, you would have to build such an amplifier with LSK170 and LSJ74 single complementary pairs or with LSK489 and LSJ689 JFETs. Because the LSK489 and LSJ689 have lower input <a href="capacitance">capacitance</a> than Toshiba parts and are duals the same kind of amplifier design would have lower noise levels and a smaller footprint. 

Amplifier bias networks will also incorporate JFETs current sources, although not necessarily in matched arrangements. JFET current mirror designs, for use in amplifiers, have been patented using matched JFETs, such as the LSK389 and <a href="GaAs">GaAs</a> JFETs . 

Besides amplifiers, discrete JFET matched pairs are also used in the design of <a href="voltage%20controlled%20resistor">voltage controlled resistor</a>s, voltage controlled current sources, <a href="current%20to%20voltage%20converter">current to voltage converter</a>s, <a href="programmable%20gain%20circuit">programmable gain circuit</a>s, <a href="voltmeter">voltmeter</a>s, <a href="Phaser%20%28effect%29">phasers</a> and a wide range of <a href="analog%20computer">analog computational circuits</a> like <a href="absolute%20value%20circuit">absolute value circuit</a>s These blocks often are designed with matched N-channel pairs, matched P-channel pairs, or complementary matched pairs.

Popularity.
The long-term popularity of discrete complementary JFETs is a result of the ability of the designer to obtain better circuit performance at lower cost points than what can be obtained with more modern highly integrated devices. Well-known audio designers, like <a href="John%20Curl%20%28designer%29">John Curl</a>, Nelson Pass and <a href="Erno%20Borbely">Erno Borbely</a>, also have proven to the marketplace, that discrete complementary JFETs are one of the better ways to achieve high-quality, <a href="Low-noise%20amplifier">low-noise audio designs</a> . 
Complementary JFET duals are also noted for their low <a href="equivalent%20noise%20voltage">equivalent noise voltage</a>, high operating voltage, thermal tracking characteristics, low <a href="offset%20voltage">offset voltage</a>, low <a href="pinch-off%20voltage">pinch-off voltage</a>s, low input <a href="Biasing">bias current</a>s, and very high <a href="input%20impedance">input impedance</a>. All of these characteristics make these devices ideal for use in high performance audio, sensor and measurement applications.

Future.
Improved JFET process technologies, discrete JFET devices and JFET topologies will continue to challenge highly integrated monolithic designs for sockets in high quality electronic products. The primary reasons are cost and customization. Costs are too high for integrated circuit companies to integrate customized high-performance for <a href="niche%20market">niche market</a>s. Costs performance trade-offs are met more easily with discrete devices. 

Discrete designs based on hybrid topology breakthroughs will also continue to challenge highly integrated, highly commercialized monolithic designs in terms of performance and cost. Hybrid topologies that combine complementary JFET, complementary MOS, complementary <a href="bipolar%20transistor">bipolar transistor</a>, complementary <a href="SiC%20JFET">SiC JFET</a> and complementary <a href="GaAs%20JFET">GaAs JFET</a>s, are easier and more cost-effectively built from discrete components than integrate into highly advanced monolithic chips.

Andrew Wales

Andrew Wales (1737-1799) was Alexandria, Virginia's first commercial brewer. Wales also became the first commercial brewer in the District of Columbia after Alexandria's 1791 incorporation into the District. Wales served as Brewmaster at John Mercer's Marlborough Brewery in Stafford County, Virginia before opening his own Alexandria brewery in 1770. <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> frequently purchased beer and barley from Wales over the course of thirty years.

Early Professional Life.
Andrew Wales was born in Scotland around 1737. He arrived in the Colonies before 1765 and held a position in John Mercer's Stafford County, VA brewery from 1765 to 1769. He rose to the position of brewmaster after a previous brewmaster failed to produce quality beer. Washington purchased a cask of Wales' beer from the Mercer Brewery in 1768 and would remain a customer of Wales' for thirty years. 

Wales Brewery.
Wales rented space in Alexandria's Town Warehouse on Duke Street and began brewing there commercially in 1770. Within two years, Wales's purchased a building to house his brewery, but did not fully relocate brewery operations until 1773. Cornelius Coningham, the first brewer in the City of Washington, took control of the brewery in 1798 renaming it Alexandria Brewery. Coningham held the brewery for Wales until a new owner was found. The brewery complex was purchased by John Fitzgerald in 1798, but was sold to settle Fitzgerald's debts after his death in 1802. The brewery complex no longer exists. Remnants of the Town Warehouse were found in November 2015 during construction of a new hotel.

Armand Godoy

Armand Godoy, (1880 <a href="Havana">Havana</a> - 1964 <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>), was a Cuban Symbolist poet.

Life.
Initially engaged in the Cuban tobacco trade, he changed his language at forty to become a French poet "in the language of Baudelaire" and settled in Paris in 1919. He was a bibliophile and collector; he devoted a special admiration to <a href="Baudelaire">Baudelaire</a>, of whom he possessed a considerable number of documents and memoires, notably the letters of Baudelaire to his mother.

Deeply attached to the poets of Parnassus and symbolism, he was the holder of an impressive collection of books, manuscripts, paintings, engravings and sculptures. 
All Godoy's work is directed towards a sort of appeasement of the soul and a forgetting of the physical condition of the poet, by the musicality of the phrases, as if the singing sounds of words contained an absolute and divine secret. "I seek ... The words of fire that have never been said," he writes in "Hosanna on the Sister" (1928).

Beyond the music of words, it is the rhythm of sentences that surprises his contemporaries. "M. Armand Godoy is, above all, a master of rhythms," writes <a href="Joseph%20Riviere">Joseph Riviere</a>, who emphasizes the importance of "rhythmic anxiety" (the expression is by <a href="Olivier%20Messiaen">Olivier Messiaen</a>) in poetic godoyan art. "This poet, it would be said, thinks by rhythms, spreads and asserts himself by musical waves. "Finally Paul Petitot Godoy called the "prince of rhythm".

Armand Godoy funded Phalanx, literary magazine founded in 1906 by the initiator of the "musicisme" Jean Royère, which collaborated John Antoine Nau, Francis Vielé-Griffin, Rene Ghil, Andre Spire, Emile Verhaeren, Louis Chadourne, André Gide . " The Phalanx was an early conciliation journals that appeared in this time of fragmentation and confusion groups and schools immediately following the final entry of the symbolism in the Literary History of France."

Horn effect

The Horn effect is one of a number of effects that psychologists call "bias <a href="blind%20spot">blind spot</a>s." Unlike the <a href="Halo%20effect">Halo effect</a>, which describes liking one aspect of something leading to having a positive predisposition toward everything about it, the horn effect works in negative directions. If the observer dislikes one aspect of a person, <a href="organization">organization</a>, <a href="brand">brand</a>, or <a href="product%20%28business%29">product</a> it negatively influences their feelings about all aspects of that entity's character or properties.

Origin of the term.
The term is derived from the English word "horn" and refers to <a href="Sign%20of%20the%20horns">Devil's Horns</a>. This is in contrast to the word <a href="Halo">Halo</a> and the <a href="Halo%20effect">Halo effect</a>, based on the concept of a <a href="Halo%20%28religious%20iconography%29">Saint's Halo</a>.

The same 1920 Thorndike study that focused on the halo effect also noted that "ratings were apparently affected by a marked tendency to think of the person in general as rather good or rather interior and to color the judgments of the qualities by this general feeling".

Alternate terminology.
It is sometimes called the Horns effect. Other terms used are

Bias in action.
The horn effect occurs when "individuals believe (that negative) traits are inter-connected." It is a phenomenon in which an observer's judgment of a person is adversely affected by the presence of (for the observer) an unfavorable aspect of this person. This bias involves a halo effect working in a negative direction; a single negative predisposition will "color the judgments" made about every other feature or aspect. The opposite is called the <a href="halo%20effect">halo effect</a>

In public.
Both of these bias effects often clash with phrases such as "words mean something" and "Your words have a history.".

At times, the horn effect may be intentionally used to cause damage.

Extended examples.
The main problem is when people allow an undesirable trait to influence their evaluation of other traits.

Pagak offensive

The Pagak offensive is a major military operation by the <a href="South%20Sudan">South Sudan</a>ese government during the <a href="South%20Sudanese%20Civil%20War">South Sudanese Civil War</a> with the aim of capturing the strategic town of Pagak and the wider <a href="Maiwut">Maiwut</a> County from <a href="Riek%20Machar">Riek Machar</a>'s <a href="Sudan%20People%27s%20Liberation%20Movement-in-Opposition">SPLM-IO</a> rebels. Since the civil war's beginning, Pagak serves as headquarters and stronghold for the rebels, and its loss is believed to possibly greatly weaken the insurgency. A large part of the government forces that take part in the offensive are members of the SPLM-IO (Juba faction), a break-away group from Machar's movement that is loyal to <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20South%20Sudan">Vice President</a> <a href="Taban%20Deng%20Gai">Taban Deng Gai</a>.

History.
Government offensive.
According to rebel officials, the government offensive began around 1 July 2017, as SPLA soldiers and allied "<a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>ese rebels" reportedly launched "surprise attacks" on positions of Machar loyalists in and around <a href="Mathiang%2C%20South%20Sudan">Mathiang</a> and Guelguk, <a href="Longechuk%20County">Longechuk County</a>; the rebels claimed that these initial assaults and others in the surrounding countryside were easily repulsed. SPLM-IO military intelligence officer Khamis Mawwil threatened that "there will be a river of <a href="body%20bag">body bag</a>s if they think they can take over our areas in Upper Nile". The situation changed, however, as fighters loyal to Taban Deng Gai joined the operations against Machar's followers. By 10 July, these militiamen had captured Mathiang and numerous towns and villages in Longechuk County from the rebels. The fighting led the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> to evacuate at least 25 aid workers from the SPLA-IO stronghold of Pagak, while thousands of civilians were displaced and around 50,000 cut off from aid. Meanwhile, the government denied that it was conducting an offensive and said that it was still honoring its unilaterally declared ceasefire.

Despite repeated counter-attacks and heavy resistance, government troops continued to advance on the strategic town of Maiwut, center of Maiwut Country, over the following weeks. Around 30,000 civilians fled the fighting and sook shelter at Pagak, while the government continued to deny that any offensive operations were taking place. A <a href="Sudan%20People%27s%20Liberation%20Army">SPLA</a> spokesman simply stated that "if Taban Deng’s forces are moving to Pagak it is their responsibility". The rebels also claimed that the <a href="Uganda%20People%27s%20Defence%20Force">Uganda People's Defence Force</a> supported the government during the offensive with air strikes.

On 27 July, the rebel-held town of <a href="Maiwut">Maiwut</a>, near the border with Ethioipia, was eventually captured by SPLA troops, consisting mainly of forces loyal to Vice-President Taban Deng Gai. Maiwut is located along the supply route between the Ethiopian border and Mathiang. Only after this victory did the government admit that it had launched an offensive, though it was now framed as "self-defense" in order to prevent constant rebel attacks on government-held areas. With the fall of Maiwut, the SPLM-IO (Juba faction) called on refugees to return to their homes in Maiwut County, while the SPLA began to besiege nearby Pagak. The first attacks on the rebel stronghold failed, but as more and more SPLA troops arrived with heavy artillery, the situation of the besieged SPLM-IO garrison became untenable. The insurgents consequently retreated on late 6 August, allowing the government to occupy Pagak without resistance on the following day. Before their withdrawal, however, the Machar loyalists set fire to their military barracks and ammunition stores so that they would not fall into the hands of the SPLA. The government went on to say that its forces were welcomed by the residents of Pagak who had "been held hostage for almost four years since the conflict erupted" by the rebels; this was however denied by local aid workers, according to whom thousands fled the SPLA soldiers.

Rebel counter-offensive.
On the same day of Pagak's fall, however, the rebels launched their own counter-offensive against Maiwut. Exploiting that most of the garrison had been moved to secure Pagak, the insurgents reportedly retook the town and captured much military equipment; the government however denied that Maiwut had fallen. According the regional rebel commander Maj. Gen. Khor Chuol Giet, the rebels had effectively cut off the government forces at Pagak and the Ethiopian border.

As the rebels now in turn besieged the government forces in Pagak, they called on the SPLA soldiers to surrender, which they refused to do. Machar's fighters consequently began to attack the town. Between 11 and 15 August heavy fighting raged at the town, with the rebels repeatedly claiming that they had fully retaken it and that the government troops had been reduced to an holdout at the Ethiopian border crossing. The government denied these claims.

Summary Of The PM Narendra Modi Speech on 71st Independence Day

PM Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day speech, talks about building a new India by 2022, resolution of Kashmir issue, and the importance of GST and demonetisation.

Addressing to the whole nation on the occasion of Independence Day Mr.Modi said that people have to come together to build a new India where the dreams of youth and women are fulfilled, the income of the farmers is doubled by 2022, and there would be no space for corruption and dynasty rule in the country. He also mentioned that violence in the name of faith is not tolarated and will be considered as a crime. 
He said people of India should take the country ahead with determinition of creating a New India. In our nation, there is no one big or small... everybody is equal. Together we can bring a positive change in the nation.

In a significant message while reaching out to people of Kashmir, Mr.Modi said that the issue will get resolved neither through “goli aur gaali” (guns and abuses) but by a friendly hugs. By encouraging new startups Mr.Modi said Young generation should be jog creators not job seekers.

The prime minister also spoke on demonetisation and linked it with the government’s commitment for anti-corruption as well as the digital push, saying that a time would come soon when paper currency will make way for all forms of digital transactions. Modi said that through demonetisation, the government had succeeded in getting hidden black money back in the system. At least more than Rs2 lakh crore black money has had to reach the banks. There are stoppages in new black money,” he added.

Central government is working with the states through policies like GST, Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, Smart Cities and Ease of Doing Business.

He was Professor at <a href="School%20for%20Advanced%20Studies%20in%20the%20Social%20Sciences">L'Ecole des hautes Etudes Sociales</a> (1931-1940). 

During 1921-1926 he worked at the <a href="Institut%20M%C3%A9tapsychique%20International">Institut Métapsychique International</a> (IMI). Sudre came into dispute with the spiritualist orientation of the IMI as his books were critical of the spiritualist hypothesis of mediumship. In 1926, he was dismissed from the IMI by director <a href="Eug%C3%A9ne%20Osty">Eugéne Osty</a>. Sudre was "strongly anti-spiritualistic". <a href="Ernesto%20Bozzano">Ernesto Bozzano</a> attempted to refute Sudre's arguments.

His book "Introduction à la Métapsychique Humaine" (1926) attacked the spiritualist hypothesis and defended an <a href="Animism">animist</a> position of creative forces similar to <a href="Henri%20Bergson">Henri Bergson</a>.

Reception.
Professor John Cohen in the "<a href="New%20Scientist">New Scientist</a>" for a review of "Treatise on Parapsychology" (1960) disputed Sudre's belief that clairvoyance had been established by science but praised the book for "demolishing" the spiritualist hypothesis of mediumship. Cohen noted that the book "ranks among the very best of its kind that have appeared on either side of the Atlantic".

Criticism of "Treatise on Parapsychology" came from <a href="Eric%20Dingwall">Eric Dingwall</a>. In a review for "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" he noted that Sudre was credulous in accepting <a href="Materialization%20%28paranormal%29">materializations</a> and psychic photographs as genuine. Sudre failed to cite the evidence of fraud in mediumship, he was also criticized for defending phenomena at <a href="Borley%20Rectory">Borley Rectory</a> as 'incontestably genuine' and ignoring evidence to the contrary.

Nonverbal autism

Nonverbal autism is a subset of <a href="autism">autism</a> where the subject is unable to <a href="Speech">speak</a>. While most <a href="autistic">autistic</a> children eventually begin to speak, there is a significant minority who will remain nonverbal. 

Background.
It is estimated that 25 to 50% of children diagnosed with <a href="Autism%20spectrum">Autism Spectrum Disorder</a> (ASD) never develop spoken language beyond a few words or utterances . Despite the growing field of research on ASD, there is not much information available pertaining to individuals with autism who never develop functional language; that, in fact, individuals with nonverbal autism are considered to be underrepresented in all of autism research. Because of the limited research on nonverbal autism, there are not many validated measurements appropriate for this population. For example, while they may be appropriate for younger children, they lack the validity for grade-school aged children and adolescents and have continued to be a roadblock for nonverbal autism research . Often in autism research, individuals with nonverbal autism are sub-grouped with LFA, categorized by learning at most one word or having minimal verbal language .

Most of the existing body of research in nonverbal autism focuses on early interventions that predict successful language outcomes.  Research suggests that most spoken language is inherited before the age of five, and the likelihood of acquiring functional language in the future past this age is minimal , that early language development is crucial to educational achievement, <a href="employment">employment</a>, independence during adulthood, and <a href="Social%20relation">social relationships</a> .

Early predictors.
The causes of nonverbal autism are unknown. However, there appears to be a relationship between <a href="joint%20attention">joint attention</a> and <a href="Linguistics">verbal communication</a>. Joint attention occurs between two individuals when one draws the other’s attention to an object through gesturing (i.e. eye-gazing, pointing) .  The ability to achieve joint attention at an early age plays a significant role in language development, and studies indicate severe lapses in joint attention in children with autism .  In one study, researchers suggest that a displayed pattern of delays, absences, or a general impaired response to stimuli (hyporesponsiveness) and a fascination with intense or repetitive stimulation (sensory seeking) is more likely in nonverbal children with autism, suggesting that both hyporesponsiveness and sensory seeking is related to poor communication outcomes in children with ASD .

Language outcomes.
For nonverbal grade school children and adolescents with autism, communication systems and interventions have been implemented to enhance language and communication outcomes.  Speech-generated devices, such as iPads, use visual displays for children who lack verbal language, giving them the task of selecting icons indicating a request or need .  For adolescents with nonverbal autism, interventions can condition them to learn more advanced operations on speech-generated devices that require more steps (i.e. turning on device, scrolling through pages), which would allow them to enhance their communicative abilities independently .  

The Picture Exchange System (PECS) is an alternative form of spontaneous communication for children with autism in which an individual selects a picture indicating a request .  PECS can be utilized in educational settings and at the child’s home.  Longitudinal studies suggest PECS can have long-term positive outcomes for school-aged children with nonverbal autism, specifically their social-communicative skills, such as higher frequencies of joint attention and initiation, and duration of cooperative play , which are all important roles in improving language outcomes.

It has also been suggested that a significant stage in acquiring verbal language is learning how to identify and reproduce syllables of words.  One study found that nonverbal and minimally verbal children with autism are capable of enhancing their oral production and vocalizing written words by isolating each syllable of a word one at a time .  The process of breaking down a syllable at a time and having it visually displayed and audibly available to the child can prompt him or her to imitate and create nonrandom and meaningful utterances .

Most of these studies contain small sample sizes and were pilot studies, making additional research significant to assess whether these findings can be generalized to all age groups of the same population. Furthermore, most studies on nonverbal autism speech-generated device communication were based on more basic skills, such as naming pictures and making requests for stimuli, while studies in advanced communication (i.e. asking "how are you?") is limited .

Friction extrusion

Friction Extrusion is a thermo-mechanical process that can be used to form fully consolidated wire, rods, tubes, or other non-circular shapes directly from a variety of precursor charges including powder, flake, machining waste (chips or swarf) or solid billet. The process imparts unique, and potentially, highly desirable microstructures to the resulting products. Friction extrusion was invented at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended primarily as a method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. 

Description of the Process and Essential Process Variables.
As in conventional extrusion processes, in friction extrusion, a shape change is enforced on the charge by forcing its passage through a die. However, friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in several key ways. Critically, in the friction extrusion process, the extrusion charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. In addition, similar to conventional extrusion, an extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate or they may be counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.  Scrolled features on the face of the die aid material flow into the extrusion orifice which can lead to order of magnitude reduction in extrusion force compared to conventional extrusions of equivalent cross section.  Third, the combined effects of elevated temperature and large levels of deformation normally lead the extrudate to have a relatively fine, equiaxed, grain structure which results from recrystallization after the conclusion of deformation: desirable crystallographic textures may also be created by the process and formation of nanocomposite structures are also possible. Based on the foregoing, it can be said that the essential controlled parameters in friction extrusion are typically:
The corresponding response parameters include:

Friction Extrusion Equipment.
In principle, friction extrusion can be performed on any machine which can produce the required rotary and linear motions between the die and charge. Examples include machines built for friction stir welding, milling machines modified to accommodate the extrusion forces, and purpose built friction extrusion equipment such as the shear assisted processing and extrusion (ShAPE™) machine at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Figures 1-3 show examples of friction extrusion equipment and extruded products. Figure 4 shows typical friction extrusion dies designed for production of wire, rod and tube. Dies are rotated in the direction which enhances material flow toward the extrusion orifice during the process.

Strain in Friction Extrusion.
In conventional extrusion, the strain imparted to the charge is loosely defined by the extrusion ratio. The extrusion ratio is simply the cross-sectional area of the extrusion billet, A divided by the cross sectional area of the extrudate, A. The extrusion strain is then e=ln(A/A). 

In friction extrusion there is an additional strain component which will arise from the shearing motion of the rotating die as it contacts the charge. The strain produced by the rotation of the die results in redundant work as it does not accomplish a shape change. In order to investigate the strain due to shearing, studies have been performed with marker materials embedded in the material to be extruded.  After extrusion, these materials are detected by metallographic methods and provide insight regarding the way in which material flows during the extrusion process. Figure 5 shows an example of how the amount of shear strain changes with changing ratios of extrusion rate to die rotation rate. In the limit of very high extrusion rates, the friction extrusion process closely mimics the conventional extrusion process with respect to strain levels.  

Typical microstructure resulting from friction extrusion.
Figure 6 shows the cross section and microstructure of a titanium wire produced by friction extrusion of Ti-6-4 powder. Notably, the cross section is fully consolidated and the transformed b microstructure indicates that extrusion likely occurred near 1000°C (above the beta transus for the alloy). Figure 7 shows grain size and crystallographic orientation typical of thin walled tubing extruded from AZ91 melt spun flake.  Grains are refined to less than 5 mm and orientation of the (0001) planes are off-normal due to the rotational shear component.  Figure 8 shows examples of friction extruded magnesium alloy tubes.  Friction consolidation has also been used to refine grain size and preferentially orient texture in functional materials such as bismuth-telluride thermoelectrics and iron-silicon magnets.  Examples of the effect of friction extrusion of microstructure have been reported for AZ31 , various aluminum alloys and pure copper.

Masami Horikoshi

, (born <a href="Kumagaya%2C%20Saitama">Kumagaya</a>, 27 November 1968) is a former Japanese rugby union player and coach. He played as scrum-half. Currently he is the coach of <a href="Rissho%20University%20RFC">Rissho University RFC</a>.

Biography.
Until his high school years, Horikoshi was aiming to play baseball become a professional baseball player, but then he abandoned it because of his shortness. He graduated from Kumagaya Industrial High School which was a prefectural rugby high school with the advice of seniors. When he played as scrum-half since one year, he was in the best four for a national high school rugby competition. In the second year, Horikoshi was selected for the Saitama prefectural selection and won his first title at the National Sports Festival, among the best four at the National High School Competition. In three years, he was called up in the Japan national high school team and participated in a New Zealand tour, placing second in the National High School competition.
In 1987, Horikoshi entered <a href="Waseda%20University">Waseda University</a> and started to play for its Rugby Football Club. He played regularly as a member during a match against an Irish students' representative team on 20 September of the same year, won two high school championships in 1987 and 1989 and won the Japanese championship in 1987. During the high school days, he was called by his nickname , due to his agile and elusive movements, similar to a ninja, his brilliant passes and his skillfulness to pass through the opponent defence. It was called the return of <a href="Hiroshi%20Izawa">Hiroshi Izawa</a>, his fellow senior. Horikoshi also served as captain at the end of the fourth year and played a good match against <a href="Meiji%20University">Meiji University</a> RFC, led by <a href="Yoshihito%20Yoshida">Yoshihito Yoshida</a>. 
In 1991, after graduating from Waseda University, Horikoshi joined <a href="Kobelco%20Steelers">Kobe Steel</a> and played for its team. Although he was thinking about getting employed to a life insurance company that promised him to go abroad in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, he chose to work for Kobe Steel, from the fact that a number of Japanese internationals worked there, including <a href="Seiji%20Hirao">Seiji Hirao</a>. For Kobe Steel, Horikoshi contributed to Kobe Steel's seventh consecutive victory in the Japanese championship after the fourth consecutive title, where Horikoshi was the captain. After that, his last match for Kobe Steel was on 28 February 1999, against <a href="Toshiba%20Brave%20Lupus">Toshiba Fuchu</a>.
He was called up first for the <a href="Japan%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Japan national team</a> in 1988, during his university second year, earning a total of 26 caps. His first cap was against Oxford University, in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, on 1 October 1988. After fighting for the scrum-half place with <a href="Toshiba%20Brave%20Lupus">Toshiba Fuchu</a> player <a href="Wataru%20Murata">Wataru Murata</a>, Horikoshi took part at the <a href="1991%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1991</a> and at the <a href="1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1995</a> Rugby World Cups. After that, even after leaving Kobe Steel, Horikoshi continued to play concurrently as supervisor at <a href="Rissho%20University">Rissho University</a> while he was called up by the Japan national team, coached by Hirao. While aiming to take part at the <a href="1999%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1999 Rugby World Cup</a>, former <a href="All%20Blacks">All Black</a> <a href="Graeme%20Bachop">Graeme Bachop</a> was recently capped, announced on August of the same year, thus leaving out Horikoshi from the roster. In 2000, Horikoshi retired as player taking part in a testimonial match between Waseda and Meiji universities, where he played along with all the Waseda players.

After retirement.
After his retirement in 1998, Horikoshi was appointed as coach of <a href="Rissho%20University%20RFC">Rissho University RFC</a>. In 2004, Rissho won against <a href="Takushoku%20University%20RFC">Takushoku University RFC</a> and led Rissho to promotion in the first division of the Kanto University Rugby League, however, Rissho was relegated to the second division in 2007. In 2012, under Horikoshi's guidance, Rissho won against Kanto Gakuin University RFC, achieving again the promotion to the first division, but it was relegated to the second division in 2014.

In 2014, following the establishment of the rugby sevens club Arukas Kumagaya, Horikoshi took office as coach and general manager of the team. The team was born as a trigger from Horikoshi and others, aiming to strengthen and train female rugby players, train coaches, spread to the region and win medals in the Olympic Games.

In 2015, Horikoshi was appointed as Saitama Rugby Ambassador, responsible for the Kumagaya public relations in the <a href="2019%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2019 Rugby World Cup</a>.

<doc id="54913127" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54913127" title="Alt-left">
Alt-left

Alt-left is a <a href="neologism">neologism</a> begun by conservative online media in 2016 suggesting the existence of a similar ideological fringe movement to the <a href="Alt-right">Alt-right</a> on the political left. The term began being used by <a href="Sean%20Hannity">Sean Hannity</a> and <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a> to described groups or outlets or individuals who were perceived as being critical of President-elect <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>. The term gained popularity when it was used against Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The term gained prevalence when U.S. president Donald Trump used the phrase during remarks on the Charlottesville rally on August 15, 2017.

Background.
Unlike the term "alt-right" (which was coined by those on the extreme right who comprise the movement), as noted by "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" writer Aaron Blake, "alt-left" was "coined by its opponents and doesn't actually have any subscribers". According to George Hawley, an assistant professor of political science at the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama">University of Alabama</a>, no such label has been adopted by any members of the progressive left. While acknowledging that there are anti-fascism activists on the left who engage in physical confrontation against members of the far-right, Oren Segal, director of the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a>'s Center on Extremism, concurred that no equivalent to those who identify as being part of the "alt-right" exists, stating that anti-fascist groups were not consciously aiming to brand themselves in the manner that white supremacists, neo-Nazis and other members of the far-right had undertaken to mainstream their ideology.

Its usage eventually circulated within conservative online media, and was popularized around those circles through its use by <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News Channel</a> host <a href="Sean%20Hannity">Sean Hannity</a> to suggest the existence of a similar ideological fringe movement on the political left. On the November 14, 2016 edition of his <a href="Hannity%20%28TV%20series%29">eponymous Fox News program</a>, Hannity used the term to excoriate "alt-left media" together with "mainstream" and "radical" media for being "biased against President-elect Trump". According to "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>", the term was popularized after it was "picked up" by Fox News as a way to "frame the Democratic wing led by <a href="Bernie%20Sanders">[Bernie] Sanders</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20Warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> as extreme".

In an early use of the term, <a href="Gary%20Bauer">Gary Bauer</a> stated on <a href="CNN">CNN</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lead%20with%20Jake%20Tapper">The Lead with Jake Tapper</a>", "It's not alt-right, it's not alt-left; it's alt-delete. It's get the bums out," as a way of equating right- and left-wing populism.

Both the term itself and the concept of an "alt-left" as a sort of opposite-but-equal mirror of the <a href="alt-right">alt-right</a> have been severely criticized for "likening" the "socialist critics" of <a href="neo-Nazism">neo-Nazism</a> "to neo-Nazis". And the term has been criticized as a label that, unlike alt-right, was not coined by the group it purports to describe, but, rather, was created by political opponents as a political smear implying a false equivalence.

Usage.
According to Branko Marcetic, assistant editor of Jacobin magazine, the label refers to a faction of the political left that does not exist, as the progressive or far left segments of political ideology do not identify by any other particular collective noun. Mark Pitcavage of the Anti-Defamation League states that the term was made up by extremist groups to create a false equivalence between the far right and “anything vaguely left-seeming that they didn't like.”

According to journalist <a href="Peter%20Beinart">Peter Beinart</a>, "What Trump calls “the alt left”... is actually <a href="antifa%20%28United%20States%29">antifa</a>." Unrelated to Donald Trump's use of the word, <a href="Buzzfeed">Buzzfeed</a> UK published an article about "alt-left media" in the United Kingdom in May 2016. The article refers to "alt-left" news websites such as Another Angry Voice, <a href="The%20Canary%20%28political%20blog%29">The Canary</a>, Evolve Politics and Skwawkbox, which are "hyperpartisan" supporters of <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> leader <a href="Jeremy%20Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>.

The term gained prevalence when U.S. president <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> used the phrase during remarks on the the <a href="Unite%20the%20Right%20rally">Charlottesville rally</a> made on August 15, 2017. Researchers such as <a href="Mark%20Pitcavage">Mark Pitcavage</a> state that the “alt-left” does not actually exist and the <a href="Pejorative">derogatory term</a> had been made up to create an <a href="false%20equivalence">equation</a> between the <a href="Far-right%20politics">far right</a> and certain activists and politicians on the <a href="left-wing%20politics">left</a>.

"Listen Now" is a song by <a href="Phil%20Manzanera">Phil Manzanera</a> and <a href="801%20%28band%29">801</a> from their <a href="Listen%20Now">album of the same name</a>. It was written by Phil Manzanera, Ian MacCormick, and <a href="Bill%20MacCormick">Bill MacCormick</a>.

Song information.
The song lasts for 7 minutes and 56 seconds, and the intro to the song lasts for just under a minute and 30 seconds. The song's lyrics deal with a person who is easily manipulated, much like the lyrics in the song "Law and Order" (also from the "Listen Now" album). The lyrics sung in the intro are, "You gotta listen now/And recognize the circle/You gotta listen now/Get wise before they lift your eyes/You gotta listen now/And hold your children closer/You gotta listen now/Get down or you won't be around." This repeats twice, and when it is sung a second time, there is a repeated refrain that says, "Now listen, now now listen." Then, Simon Ainley's lead vocal enters as he sings the following lyrics: "Well the sunshine shines all day when the man calls for his pay/But you gotta go through that/Yes, you gotta go through that/When you've paid what you owe, you might have to try to slow/But you gotta go through that/So, you gotta live through that/But when the masters of the tame require to repossess your name/You don't have to go through that/You don't have to live through that." The song starts in the key of A major, and after the intro, the key changes to B major before Ainley sings the first verse: "Thunder rolling down out of dried-up skies/Every inch of earth crying out for water/Television man spelling out the price/Everywhere the sheep creeping to the slaughter/Cold weather coming, people feel the fire/Living on Dead End Street with no desire." During the bridge (or <a href="thirty-two-bar_form%23Middle_eight">middle eight</a>), he sings, "We taught ourselves to trust our heads/It's getting us nowhere/If fifty-five million hearts can't feel it/We'll never know where." After the bridge, there is a saxophone solo played by <a href="Mel%20Collins">Mel Collins</a> in the original key of A. Then, the key changes back to B before Ainley sings the final verse. After the final verse, the background chorus, "Now listen, now now listen," is repeated while Ainley repeats the line, "You gotta listen now." There is a <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a> played by Manzanera over the ending refrain. This segues into a military <a href="big%20band">big band</a> coda, which is also performed by Collins as the song reaches its <a href="conclusion%20%28music%29">conclusion</a>.

Colors (Beck album)

Colors is an upcoming <a href="album">album</a> by <a href="Americans">American</a> musician <a href="Beck">Beck</a> due out October 2017. "Colors" will be <a href="Beck%20discography">Beck's tenth official studio album</a>.

Background.
"Colors" was recorded at <a href="Greg%20Kurstin">Greg Kurstin</a>'s <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> studio with Beck and Kurstin playing nearly every instrument themselves between 2013 and 2017. Beck described the recording process to "<a href="NME">NME</a>" saying "for the first year, we were experimenting and there was a lot of trial and error. I was touring constantly while making it, so I was attempting to bring some of that energy back to the studio, which isn't always the easiest thing to do. ‘Dreams’ was one of the early songs to come along and make me think the idea had legs."

"<a href="Dreams%20%28Beck%20song%29">Dreams</a>" was released on June 15, 2015 as the lead single from an upcoming album, later announced to be titled "Colors". The upbeat track was inspired by MGMT and marked contrast to the somber mood of Beck's previous album "<a href="Morning%20Phase">Morning Phase</a>". Beck said at the time, "I was really trying to make something that would be good to play live." The song was heavily featured on <a href="Beats%201">Beats 1</a>, <a href="Apple%20Music">Apple Music</a>'s flagship radio station, with 65 plays in July 2015. "Dreams" was ranked among the best songs of 2015 on annual year-end lists by "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" and "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>".

On June 2, 2016, "<a href="Wow%20%28Beck%20song%29">Wow</a>" (sometimes stylized as "WOW") was released as the second single and it was confirmed the new album was scheduled to be released October 21, 2016. That release date was later delayed and scrubbed from Beck's PR site with no explanation given. Beck told <a href="KROQ">KROQ</a> that "Wow" "was completely off the top of my head. I didn't write any of it. It was just us fooling around in the studio. I didn't even mean to release it. I was working on another song and came up with the riff and then I just started freestyling." "Wow" was included on "Billboard"s 100 Best Pop Songs of 2016" list.

Beck told "NME" "the rest of the album is probably what exists in the range between 'Dreams' at one end and 'Wow' at the other. Beck told "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", "these are complex songs all trying to do two or three things at once. It's not retro and not modern. To get everything to sit together so it doesn't sound like a huge mess was quite an undertaking."

The music video for "Up All Night" premiered August 9, 2017 at Hollywood's Arclight Cinemas during an all-day conference for <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a> where it was announced it will be released to the public in the near future and be "Colors" third single. "Up All Night" previously appeared in the video game "<a href="FIFA%20%2717">FIFA '17</a>" and was used in a commercial for Fossil smartwatches.

"<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" described "Seventh Heaven" as a "lost '80s pop classic" and "Dear Life" as “lush Beatles-like psychedelia spiked with an existential cry-for-help for a lyric." Beck told "Q" that "Dear Life is just about the inevitable turmoil of being alive. Like, can somebody throw me a lifeline here?” "The New York Times" previewed that "No Distraction” had "a strummy guitar part over a foursquare rock beat, and a chord progression partly cribbed from the Police" and that "Dear Life" was "a late-Beatles-esque existential cry, with a welcome core of oddness within its retro shell."

Beck discussed "No Distraction" with "Q" saying, "Anybody who has a phone or computer lives with the distractions pulling you this way and that. We haven't figured out how to have access to everybody and everything all the time and how it affects us physically and neurologically. Or at least I haven't. My analogy to friends has been that I feel as if somebody has removed the front door of my house, permanently."

On July 28, 2017, Beck teased the title of his new album by posting a photo of <a href="John%20Baldessari">John Baldessari</a>'s "Tips for Artists Who Want to Sell" on his Instagram account. Beck's post followed an accidental leak of the title and release date by an online retailer's private pre-order page briefly being set to public viewing. On August 11, 2017, Beck officially announced the album would be titled "Colors" and released in October 2017.

Richard Coons

Richard Rowland Coons (December 13, 1929-November 28, 2003) was a California landscape and marine painter and author of the book, "Robert Clunie: Plein-Air Painter of the Sierra". He owned Coons Gallery in Bishop, California, the original art studio and residence built by <a href="Robert%20Clunie">the artist Robert Clunie</a>.

Early life.
Richard Rowland Coons was one of three sons born to William 'Bill' Coons and Grace Eva Manley on December 13, 1929 in Los Angeles, California. In November 1928 Bill was hired by the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power as a member of the survey crew for the proposed Colorado River Aqueduct. (The recently organized Metropolitan Water District of Southern California would be the agency authorized to oversee the construction of the aqueduct.) Due to a delay in the start of the project, Bill was temporarily assigned to field survey work in eastern California’s Owens Valley, where Los Angeles had large land and water holdings.  While assigned to this region, Bill was able to secure a position as hydrographer with the Department for his brother Lenn. Although their sojourn in the Owens Valley was brief, they later would discover, as writer and naturist Mary Austin earlier had found, that this “big mysterious land, a lonely inhospitable land, beautiful, terrible,” cast its spell. The family moved back and forth between Culver City in Los Angeles and the Owens Valley towns of Bishop, Big Pine and Independence. By 1941, the family settled in Long Beach. Richard and his brothers joined the Sea Scouts. In response to the home front war effort, Richard became a civil defense volunteer, messenger class. Near their home on Elm Street was an extensive area of open marshland adjacent to the mouth of the Los Angeles River.  Overgrown with willow trees and waterfowl, it was an ideal place to practice survival skills. Richard and his cohorts relished overnight camp-outs, feasting on horse meat burgers and potatoes slathered with mud and baked in the campfire coals.  

The brothers bought a 14-foot sailboat and portaged it from in a backyard berth several blocks, over curbs, through sand, to its launch into Alamitos Bay. At the conclusion of their maiden cruise no one had the presence of mind to jump ashore and secure the boat, whereupon they immediately began to drift back into the bay. Fortunately the mast lodged against the Second Street Bridge and one of the boys was strong enough to climb the mast and with a line from the bridge towed the vessel and crew back to the beach. They sailed all around the Long Beach Harbor, Terminal Island, San Pedro, and out in the outer Los Angeles Harbor, clear out to sea. Richard was thirteen years old. People thought for sure they were in trouble. Big boats would offer to help us and they would be insulted. "We were sailors; we were not in trouble," Richard said. For the next several summers, Richard secured work on fishing boats. The sea's energy, its still moments, its beauty, its sense of danger, of always being ready to pounce, offered the youthful Coons a kaleidoscope of images. Unconsciously, the observing eye of the inchoate artist was storing away an inventory of memory, an iconography of the sea in all its capricious shades and moods—the feel of the spray in his face, the play of light or shadow on water, how a boat sits in water, the sights and sounds, the smell of the wharves—that much later would inform the weir of his imagination.  

Several times every year, the family returned to Bishop, in the Owens Valley, to visit relatives. In 1946, at the end of his sophomore year in high school, Richard asked his parents if he could move to Bishop and live with relatives while finishing high school. They agreed. 

Early artistic influence.
In the fall of 1947, Richard assisted his grandfather and the family business, Bishop Pumice Concrete Products, in the delivery of concrete blocks to artist and Bishop newcomer, Robert Clunie, a member of the California Art Club. The building materials were for the construction of the Clunie home and studio on Bishop Creek. Aware of Richard’s notable track accomplishments as reported in the local newspaper, and as an athlete of some note himself, Clunie struck up a conversation about sports with the younger Coons. Clunie’s son Kent enrolled that same year in Bishop High School and he and Richard quickly became good friends. Often a visitor in the Clunie home or accompanying Kent in the Sierra backcountry while Robert observed the artist capture on canvas “the beauty and perfection” of nature. They were the first oil paintings Richard had seen close enough to touch. Not long afterward, twenty-year-old Richard purchased, by installment, his first Robert Clunie painting, Monterey Boat Works. 

In 1972, Clunie received a commission to paint Lake George above Mammoth Lakes area and invited Richard to accompany him and experiment with painting in the open, in "plein-air." Richard began painting. Clunie told him that a fledgling artist should never release any of his early works for at least one year "lest they come back to haunt you." Richard heeded Clunie’s advice and destroyed approximately fifty of his early paintings. With wry humor he mused, “They do make a nice fire." That same year, the USFS, told Clunie that he had to dismantle his 'permanent summer camp' that he'd made for years, between Fourth and Fifth Lakes in the Palisades. Richard and Kent helped remove more than 30 years of accumulated possessions stored at the camp each season. Because of Clunie’s lengthy career in the high country and the extensive collection of art that it inspired, Richard was obsessed with similar high mountain scenes, “where you find the granite peaks with snow and glaciers, whitebark and lodgepole pines and the wonderful north face snowfields, the places you had to hike to—not the ones at the end of the road.” 

The scenery of the Alpine Zone at 11,000 feet and above, was Richard's favorite to paint, so he was away from home much of the summer. Although on occasion he hired a packer with pack animals, generally he hiked in to the selected area laden with a heavy pack of essential supplies for a ten-day excursion.

Career.
In winter, when the Sierra was covered with snow, Richard painted Death Valley. While painting Dante’s View (30x24) in 1982, a sand storm interrupted his work. Having left the windows of his trailer open for ventilation, he returned to find the bed and much of the interior covered with two inches of sand. He spent close to a year in Laguna Beach, associated with Larry Kronquist Gallery. At Larry's urging, he took a marine painting workshop with Bennett Bradbury in Monterey, California. He soon returned to the Sierra, and spent many months hiking into the backcountry with his painting canvases and supplies.

Berlin Now

Berlin Now: The City After the Wall (also published as Berlin Now: The Rise of the City and the Fall of the Wall) is a 2014 book by German writer <a href="Peter%20Schneider">Peter Schneider</a>.

Background and synopsis.
Published on the 25th anniversary of the <a href="Fall%20of%20the%20Berlin%20Wall">Fall of the Berlin Wall</a>, "Berlin Now" is a story of how Berlin has changed since reunification to become Europe's most vibrant melting-pot of artists, immigrants and entrepreneurs. "Berlin Now" is described as a "longtime Berliner's bright, bold, and digressive exploration of the heterogeneous allure of this vibrant city." The book combines memoir, history, anecdote and reportage on subjects as diverse as the differences between the sex lives of former East and West Berliners to the present-day hidden quirks of the city.

Reception.
David Hugh Smith, for the "<a href="Christian%20Science%20Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a>" praised "Berlin Now" as "engrossing" writing that Schneider deserves plaudits. However, Smith did criticise how "Schneider veers alarmingly off course with chapters not so much about Berlin but about overarching German issues – about, for example, the Stasi, and immigration."

Writing for the "Quarterly Conversation", Katy Derbyshire a Berlin-based German-language translator was more critical of "Berlin Now", writing that "Schneider reveals himself as a gnarled Cold Warrior who has been stricken with many of the maladies common to his generation. With the specter of Communism exorcized, his new enemy is Islam." Derbyshire wrote that Schneider's "representation of ethnic minorities in Berlin Now is strictly black-and-white—as either victims or perpetrators of crimes, rarely active agents...Instead of a depiction of a diverse and fast-evolving minority making in-roads into the city’s intellectual, cultural, and business life, what Schneider gives us is an attack on Muslims." Derbyshire concluded "What Peter Schneider gives us in Berlin Now is his own very limited perspective on present-day Berlin."

In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" <a href="Nicholas%20Kulish">Nicholas Kulish</a> writes that "Schneider seeks to explain why the city became 'the capital of creative people from around the world today.'" Kulish, however is critical of Schneider "pontificating" about Muslim immigrants and his apparent praise for anti-Muslim politicians.

<doc id="54914726" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54914726" title="Old Quarter, Hanoi">
Old Quarter, Hanoi

The Old Quarter  () is the name commonly given to that part of Hanoi that has been in existence since imperial times and which used to be located outside the <a href="Imperial%20Citadel%20of%20Th%C4%83ng%20Long">Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long</a>. This quarter used to be a residential, manufacturing, and commercial center, where each street was specialized in one specific type of manufacturing or commerce. Nowadays, the quarter is an attraction for people interested in the <a href="history%20of%20Hanoi">history of Hanoi</a>.

Another common name referring to approximately the same area is the 36 streets (), after the 36 streets that used to make up the urban area of the city. These 36 streets are not all located inside the Old Quarter proper, though.

Extent.
The official extent of the Hanoi Old Quarter has been fixed by a 1995 decision from the Vietnamese <a href="Ministry%20of%20Construction%20%28Vietnam%29">Ministry of Construction</a>: in the north it is limited be Hàng Đậu street, in the west by Phùng Hưng street, in the south by Hàng Bông street, Hàng Gai street, Cầu Gỗ street, and Hàng Thùng street, and in the east by Trần Quang Khải street and Trần Nhật Duật street. Several of the streets that were part of the historic urban area of Hanoi lie outside this region, which was determined for being most dense in historical streets and for having maintained its historical character best.

The official Old Quarter is part of the <a href="Ho%C3%A0n%20Ki%E1%BA%BFm%20District">Hoàn Kiếm District</a>. Its total area is about 100 <a href="Hectare">ha</a> and it counts 76 streets distributed over 10 <a href="Ph%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng">wards</a>.

History.
The residential and commercial area that is now the Old Quarter came to be during the <a href="L%C3%BD%20dynasty">Lý</a> and <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20dynasty">Trần</a> dynasties and was then located east of the <a href="Imperial%20Citadel%20of%20Th%C4%83ng%20Long">Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long</a> and along the <a href="Red%20River%20%28Asia%29">Red River</a>. During the <a href="Later%20L%C3%AA%20dynasty%20early%20period">Lê dynasty</a>, scholar <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Tr%C3%A3i">Nguyễn Trãi</a> already mentioned some of the areas each specialized in one particular trade. It was then surrounded by a defensive wall with several gates.

During the Lê dynasty, the area included several lakes and wetlands, the largest of which was Thái Cực lake. These lakes, as well as the <a href="T%C3%B4%20L%E1%BB%8Bch%20River">Tô Lịch River</a> were connected with <a href="Ho%C3%A0n%20Ki%E1%BA%BFm%20Lake">Hoàn Kiếm lake</a> and the <a href="Red%20River%20%28Asia%29">Red River</a>. Near the end of the 19th century these lakes and rivers became isolated from each other.

During the Lý and Trần dynasties, many people from the surrounding plains migrated to the city and settled in what is now the Old Quarter, creating the densest urban area of the city. The Lê dynasty period saw an additional influx of <a href="Overseas%20Chinese">Chinese immigrants</a> who arrived to trade, creating several Chinese neighbourhoods..

When the <a href="French%20Indochina">French ruled over Vietnam</a>, they partially rebuilt the area. This period saw many French and <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indians</a> settling there to conduct business. Two small markets were demolished to make place for <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng%20Xu%C3%A2n%20Market">Đồng Xuân Market</a>. Furthermore a <a href="tramway">tramway</a> was constructed through the quarter.

The area is still the commercial heart of Hanoi.

Trade streets.
The most famous trait of the Old Quarter are its areas dedicated to one specific trade. Of old, craftsmen from villages around the city would gather in the area of their craft to sell their wares to merchants. Finally, the crafts special to each area gave their names to the streets of the quarter, such that most streets acquired names starting with "" ("wares"), such as Hàng Tre street ("bamboo wares street") and Hàng Đồng street ("copper wares street").

Several of the streets are still specialized in the trade that gave them their names. Others still specialize in one specific trade, but a different one from their traditional specialty — such as Hàng Buồm street ("sails street") which has become dominated by <a href="B%C3%A1nh">Vietnamese cakes</a> and <a href="candy">candy</a>.

Historic houses.
Characteristic of the Old Quarter is the ancient architecture of the commercial area. Most of the historic houses there are tube houses with slanted tile roofs, of which the side facing the street used to be used as entrance to the shop inside. Houses of this type were mostly built in the 18th and 19th centuries — before that most houses had thatched roofs.

During the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a>, Vietnamese fighters managed to avoid French soldiers by making holes connecting adjacent buildings. This way they could travel from one end of a street to the other without having to go outside.

Since the end of the 20th century, the historic houses have been dwindling in number.

Historic remnants.
The Old Quarter contains many historic sights, such as temples, pagodas, and assembly halls.

Most craft streets used to have a temple dedicated to worshiping mythical founders of the craft. Particular is that the ground floor of such communal temples in the Hanoi Old Quarter was often still used for commerce. With the passage of time, most such communal temples have been destroyed.

Several temples have survived, such as the Mã Mây temple, the Kim Cổ temple, etc.

Of old, several city gates were located in what is now the Old Quarter. Now only the Quan Chưởng gate is still left.

Preservation.
Many of the historic remnants of the Old Quarter have deteriorated and are in need of restoration. For the <a href="Millennial%20Anniversary%20of%20Hanoi">1000th anniversary of Nội</a> in 2010, the Hanoi People's Committee decided to spend 50 billion VND on the refurbishing of 75 streets inside and outside the Old Quarter, among others for applying lime to restore the yellow color of façades in the Old Quarter. The process has been criticised for having been executed carelessly, leading to a less than optimal result.

Vietnamese painter <a href="B%C3%B9i%20Xu%C3%A2n%20Ph%C3%A1i">Bùi Xuân Phái</a> has created many paintings of the Old Quarter, pioneering a particular school of Vietnamese painting.

<doc id="54914835" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54914835" title="Cccp-1">
Cccp-1

Conserved coiled-coil protein 1 (cccp-1) is a gene identified in "<a href="C.%20elegans">C. elegans</a>" that codes the protein CCCP-1 on chromosome III: 17.95. The best human <a href="ortholog">ortholog</a> of cccp-1 is <a href="C10orf118">CCDC186</a> (coiled-coil domain containing 186). CCCP-1 shares properties similar to that of <a href="GOLGA2">golgins</a>.

As <a href="supercoil">supercoil</a>s, coiled coils are more fit to transfer mechanical pulling energy than single <a href="alpha-helices">alpha-helices</a>.

Molecular interactions.
It is believed that CCCP-1 tethers onto the <a href="trans-golgi">trans-golgi</a> or recycling secretory vesicle via a <a href="RAB%202">RAB 2</a> anchor (elegans UNC-108, which recruits CCCP-1) as part of <a href="dense-core%20vesicle">dense-core vesicle</a> generation or maturation. CCCP-1 has predicted interaction with T22C8.3 (which has predicted interaction on <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>). It is yet uncharacterized how CCCP-1 interacts with the <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a>, but the <a href="neuronal%20secretory%20pathway">neuronal secretory pathway</a> (anterograde) is driven by <a href="kinesin">kinesin</a>, a <a href="myosin">myosin</a>-like mechanical effector. This suggests CCCP-1 tethers UNC-108 either directly or indirectly to kinesin or other <a href="motor%20protein">motor protein</a> that travels the cytoskeleton.

Associated effects at intracellular and behavioral levels.
CCCP-1 is involved in <a href="dense%20core%20granule">dense core granule</a> maturation, locomotion and functions in regulation of locomotion involved in locomotory behavior; cccp-1 exhibits Rab GTPase binding activity. CCCP-1 also has a <a href="caspase%20recruitment%20domain">caspase recruitment domain</a> (CARD domain) implying a role in apoptosis regulation.

Expression and localization.
CCCP-1 is expressed in the <a href="spermatheca">spermatheca</a>, <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a>, and the <a href="intestine">intestine</a>; cccp-1 is localized to the <a href="axon">axon</a>, the <a href="neuronal%20cell%20body">neuronal cell body</a> and the <a href="perinuclear%20region">perinuclear region</a> of <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a>. More than 60% of intracellular CCDC186 localizes to the <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a>.

Properties.
CCCP-1's <a href="RNA%20transcript">transcript</a> length is approximately 2400kb with a <a href="coding%20sequence">coding sequence</a> just over 2200kb. There are two splice variants: 734 aa and 743 aa. CCCP-1's (the protein product) estimated mass is 85 kDa.

C-terminus.
It has been observed that the <a href="c-terminus">c-terminus</a> of conserved coiled coil protein 1 (CC3) is necessary and sufficient to localize to and bind RAB 2. This region also has potential binding properties to <a href="lipid%20membrane">lipid membrane</a>s. The pfscan and CARD motifs span this region. The <a href="n-terminus">n-terminus</a> domain has not been characterized.

Donnelly's Bar and Kay's Tavern attacks

On 19 December 1975, two coordinated attacks were carried out by the <a href="Ulster%20Volunteer%20Force">Ulster Volunteer Force</a> (UVF) in pubs either side of the <a href="Irish%20border">Irish border</a>. The first attack, a <a href="car%20bomb">car bombing</a> took place outside Kay's Tavern, a pub in <a href="Dundalk">Dundalk</a> in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> close to the border. The second attack, a gun and bomb attack, took place at Donnelly's Bar & Filling Station in <a href="Silverbridge%2C%20County%20Armagh">Silverbridge, County Armagh</a> just across the border inside <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. The attack has been linked to the <a href="Glenanne%20gang">Glenanne gang</a>, a group of <a href="Ulster%20loyalism">Loyalist militants</a> who were either members of the <a href="Ulster%20Volunteer%20Force">UVF</a>, the <a href="Ulster%20Defence%20Regiment">Ulster Defence Regiment</a> (UDR), the <a href="Royal%20Ulster%20Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> (RUC) and the closely linked UVF paramilitary the <a href="Red%20Hand%20Commando">Red Hand Commando</a> (RHC), some of the Glenanne gang were members of the two of these organizations at the same time like gang leaders <a href="Billy%20Hanna">Billy Hanna</a> who was in both the UVF and the UDR and who fought for the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and <a href="John%20Weir%20%28loyalist%29">John Weir (loyalist)</a> who was in the UVF and was a Sergeant in the RUC. At least 25 British soldiers and police officers were named as members of the gang. 

The Attacks.
According to journalist Joe Tiernan the attacks were planned and led by <a href="Robert%20McConnell%20%28loyalist%29">Robert McConnell</a> and <a href="Robin%20Jackson">Robin "The Jackal" Jackson</a> who were both alleged to have carried out dozens of sectarian murders during <a href="The%20Troubles">The Troubles</a> mainly from 1974 - 1977 mostly in south Armagh which in 1975 was virtually lawless and Loyalist paramilitaries and the <a href="Provisional%20IRA">Provisional IRA</a> roamed the streets and countryside and could set up bogus military checkpoints freely. 

The attack was planned at the Glenanne farm of RUC reserve officer James Mitchell which was were most <a href="terrorist">terrorist</a> acts were planned by the gang and the farm also acted as a UVF arms dump and bomb making site. After the attacks were finished everyone involved in both attacks was to meet up at Mitchells farm. Then if there was any heat Mitchell could claim the bombers and shooters were with him when the attacks happened 

The first phase of the <a href="terrorist">terrorist</a> plan started at around 18:15 along Crowe Street in Dundalk when a 100-pound no-warning bomb exploded in a <a href="Ford">Ford</a> Sports car just outside Kay's Tavern. The blast killed Hugh Waters who was a tailor and had just dropped into the pub to deliver some clothes he had altered for the pubs owner almost instantly. Jack Rooney who was walking past the town hall on the opposite side of the street was struck in the head by flying shrapnel and died three days later. A further 20 people were injured in the explosion, several of them very seriously. The car bomb was fitted with fake southern registration plates and placed in one of the busiest streets in Dundalk in the hope of causing maximum death and injury. According to Joe Tiernan, UVF commander Robin Jackson planted the bomb and along with other members of his unit escaped across the border in a blue <a href="Hillman%20Hunter">Hillman Hunter</a> around the time the bomb went off. 

At around 21:00, about three hours after the Dundalk bombing the second phase of the coordinated terrorist plan which was led by McConnell took place at Donnelly's Bar & Filling Station in the small Armagh village Silverbridge close to <a href="Newtownhamilton">Newtownhamilton</a>. 
As the unit arrived in two cars came unusually fast towards the pub, the publican's teenage son Michael Donnelly (14) who was serving petrol to a customer noticing the strange speed of the cars ran towards the pub to warn people, but before he could make it inside McConnell jumped out of one of the cars and shot the teenage boy dead with a <a href="Sten%20gun">Sten gun</a>, McConnell then shot the man Michael Donnelly had been serving petrol to in the head, although the man survived the shooting he was maimed for life. Then a second gunman who is believed to be <a href="Billy%20McCaughey">Billy McCaughey</a> a UVF volunteer and a member of the <a href="Special%20Patrol%20Group%20%28RUC%29">RUC Special Patrol Group</a> shot dead a second person, local man Patrick Donelly (no relation to the pub owners family) who had been waiting for petrol. McConnell then went inside the pub and sprayed the bar with his Sten SMG, killing a third man called Trevor Bracknell and seriously injured three other people. As McConnell withdrew back to his car, two other members of the unit carried a 25-pound cylinder bomb inside the pub. While McConnell's unit fled back to Mitchells farm, the bomb went off in the pub but by this time most of the people had already ran out of the pub. The explosion at Kay's Tavern destroyed about 80% of the building and it started a huge fire and injured a further two people were injured, one of the injured men had lost a foot and a hand in the explosion.
Nobody has ever been charged for these crimes.


Aftermath attacks.
On 31 December not even a forthnight, just 12 days since the Dundalk and Silverbridge attacks, <a href="Irish%20Republican">Irish Republican</a>s strike back. 
The <a href="Irish%20National%20Liberation%20Army">INLA</a> left a bomb in a duffel bag in a pub called the Central Bar in the mainly Protestant town of Gilford in <a href="County%20Down">County Down</a>. When the bombers were safe away the bomb exploded killing three young Protestant civilians having a good time drinking and enjoying each others company. About 15 people were injured in the blast also. 
But this attack at Gilford was not to avenge those who had been killed at Dundalk or Armagh, it was to avenge the death of an INLA political activist who had been killed by the UVF on 15 December 

<a href="Reavey%20and%20O%27Dowd%20killings">Reavey-O'Dowd killings</a> Just five days after the Gilford attack on 4 January 1976. Glenanne Gang members went viciously wild one night & decided to try and whipe out entire families. First they burst into the Reavey house, they were a Catholic Family. Then three gunmen shoot dead the three Reavey Brothers, John (24), Brian (22) and Anthony (17) Reavey. Another brother Eugene Reavey said Eugene Reavey, said "Our entire family could have been wiped out. Normally on a Sunday, the twelve of us would have been home, but that night my mother took everybody [else] out to visit my aunt"
About a half an hour later another UVF gang burst into the O'Dowd's house, they were another Catholic family and there was 16 people in the house at the time, a gunman walked into one room and just sprayed it with bullets killing O'Dowd brothers Barry (24) and Declan O'Dowd (19) and their uncle . All three were members of the Social Democratic and Labour Party]], Barry and Declan's father was injured in the attack. 

<a href="Kingsmill%20massacre">Kingsmill massacre</a>
Just two days later the IRA (using the covername "Republican Action Force") hit back ruthlessly and brutally hard against 11 Protestant civilians on their way home from work. Near Kingsmill along the Whitecross road the IRA set-up a checkpoint, stopped a minibus, they took the whole 12 people, all males of the bus and lined them all up against the side of the bus, they asked was anyone a Catholic. One person said "yes", one of the gunmen told the Catholic to run as fast as he can and not to look back. Now there was just 11 Protestant workers lined up against the bus. The lead gunman then said "Right", and the others immediately opened fire on the workers.[24] The eleven men were shot at very close range with <a href="automatic%20rifles">automatic rifles</a>, which included an <a href="AR-15">AR-15</a>, an <a href="M1%20carbine">M1 carbine</a> and an <a href="M1%20Garand">M1 Garand</a>. A total of 136 rounds were fired in less than a minute. 10 people were killed and one person barely survived the shooting. John Bryans (46), Robert Chambers (19), Reginald Chapman (25), Walter Chapman (23), Robert Freeburn (50), Joseph Lemmon (46), John McConville (20), James McWhirter (58), Robert Walker (46) and Kenneth Worton (24). Alan Black (then 32) was the only one who survived the third worst shooting incident of <a href="The%20Troubles">The Troubles</a> in terms of deaths behind the <a href="Ballymurphy%20Massacre">Ballymurphy Massacre</a> 11 killed and <a href="Bloody%20Sunday">Bloody Sunday</a> 14 killed. 

After the horror at Kingsmill the large scale attacks didn't happen again, at least not for five months. 
On 15 May 1976, five Catholic civilians were killed in two separate attacks by the UVF. In the first attack a UVF bomb killed two Catholic civilians and injured several more at the Avenue Bar on <a href="Union%20Street">Union Street</a> in <a href="Belfast%20city">Belfast city</a>. The second attack took place in South Armagh, the Glenanne Gangs favorite place to operate. In this attack on a pub called Clancey's Bar in <a href="Charlemont">Charlemont</a> a further 3 people died and dozens injured. 
Later that the IRA killed three RUC officer in a landmine attack near Belcoo RUC station, <a href="County%20Fermanagh">County Fermanagh</a>
5*
The next day 16 May, the IRA hit back for the Avenue's and Clancy's bar attacks. They shot dead two Protestant civilians outside a social club on <a href="Alliance%20Road">Alliance Road</a> in Belfast. An off-duty Protestant RUC officer was also shot dead which brought the total to three innocent Protestants 

These type of attacks went on for the rest of the year.

Hiroshima Academy Junior and Senior High School in <a href="Hiroshima%20City">Hiroshima</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, is an integrated middle and high that has provided for boys a <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> and <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> education since 1956.

History.
In 1956 the <a href="Society%C2%A0of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> established this as its third junior-senior high school in Japan. The school follows the broad objectives of <a href="Ignatian%20Pedagogical%20Paradigm">Ignatian pedagogy</a>, <a href="Cura%20personalis">personal care for each student as an individual,</a> and teamwork. It pursues the objective of training "men for and with others."

In 1956 the Hiroshima Junior High School building was completed and the school opened. By 1958 the office, high school, science, and residence buildings were completed and the high school was certified for opening in 1959. In 1962 a gymnasium and auditorium were completed. In 1982 the West Building was added, along with the small gymnasium. 

Early on the school ran a dormitory and recruited from all over Japan. In the late 1980s the dormitory was closed and the building demolished.

Vilela people

The Vilela people, or Vilelas, are an <a href="indigenous%20people">indigenous people</a> in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Today, their few remaining descendants live primarily in the provinces of <a href="Chaco%20Province">Chaco</a> and <a href="Santiago%20del%20Estero%20Province">Santiago del Estero</a>, with smaller numbers in the <a href="Rosario">Rosario</a> and <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> urban areas. In the province of Chaco, the Vilelas live together with the <a href="Toba%20people">Toba</a> (or Qom) people in communities such as the <a href="Colonia%20Aborigen%20Chaco">Colonia Aborigen Chaco</a> (Chaco Aboriginal Colony). They also reside in rural areas and at the periphery of large cities such as <a href="Resistencia">Resistencia</a>, <a href="Presidencia%20Roque%20S%C3%A1enz%20Pe%C3%B1a">Sáenz Peña</a>, <a href="Machagai">Machagai</a>, and <a href="Quitilipi">Quitilipi</a>. In Santiago del Estero Province, the Vilela people live in their own communities as well as in communities shared with the <a href="Lule%20people">Lule people</a>, with whom they are closely related and share a <a href="Lule-Vilela%20languages">language family</a>.

History.
The Vilela people refer to themselves by the <a href="endonym">endonym</a> "uakambalelté", or "waqha-umbael-te", both of which translate to "those who speak Waqha" in their native <a href="Vilela%20language">Vilela language</a>, which they refer to as "Waqha". The language is subdivided into three dialects, "chinipi", "sinipi", and "ocol". "Ocol", with only a handful of current speakers, is the only dialect which survives to this day.

Similarly to the Lules, the Vilelas had a culture intermediate between those of the indigenous peoples of the <a href="Andes">Andes</a>, the <a href="Pampas">Pampas</a>, and the <a href="Cuyo%20%28Argentina%29">Cuyo</a> region. By the fifteenth century, they had established themselves in the north of today's <a href="Tucum%C3%A1n%20Province">Tucumán</a> and Santiago del Estero provinces, as well as the east and southeast of the <a href="Salta%20Province">Salta Province</a>. They were <a href="nomad">nomadic</a> and sustained themselves through <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunting and gathering</a>. They hunted the <a href="peccary">peccary</a>, and harvested <a href="carob">carob</a> and <a href="honey">honey</a>.

After the Spanish conquest of the Tucumán region, the Vilelas moved eastward, into the eastern and southeastern parts of the <a href="Gran%20Chaco">Gran Chaco</a>. At that time, they were made up of the following subgroups: chunupí, pazaine, atalala, omoampa, yeconoampa, vacaa, chole, ipa, and yooc (or guamalca). During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the <a href="Guaycuru">Guaycuru</a> peoples successfully domesticated the <a href="horse">horse</a>, which they used for hunting, transportation, and waging war. This allowed them to expand their region of influence, forcing the Vilelas to move even further east, toward the <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20River">Paraná River</a>.

The <a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a> founded three <a href="mission">mission</a>s in Vilela lands, lasting until the Jesuit expulsion of 1767-1768:


The last Vilela <a href="cacique">cacique</a>, or chief, in the Chaco region, known as Leoncito, lived near the city of <a href="Resistencia">Resistencia</a> during the mid-nineteenth century.

Today.
With few exceptions, the Vilela people no longer speak their native language, instead primarily speaking <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, with some speakers of <a href="Toba%20language">Toba</a> (Qom). 

The 2004-2005 Complementary Indigenous Survey did not identify the Vilela people; however, the 2010 Argentine Census identified 519 people of Vilela heritage in Argentina, 359 of them in the province of Santiago del Estero.

Ivo Fürer

Jakob Andreas Ivo Fürer (born 20 April 1930) is a Swiss prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He was Bishop of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Saint%20Gallen">St. Gallen</a> from 1995 to 2005.

Life.
Ivo Fürer was born in <a href="Gossau%20SG">Gossau</a>, Switzerland, and studied catholic theology at <a href="Innsbruck%20University">Innsbruck University</a> and canon law in Rome at the <a href="Pontifical%20Gregorian%20University">Pontifical Gregorian University</a>, where in 1957 he earned a doctorate in canon law. He was ordained a priest on 3 April 1954. He was a chaplain in <a href="Herisau">Herisau</a> from 1958 to 1963 and in <a href="Altst%C3%A4tten">Altstätten</a> from 1963 to 1967. He became Bishop's Secretary in St. Gallen in 1967 and then Bishop's Vicar in 1969. In 1971 he helped found the Working Community of Christian Churches in Switzerland, a body of the National Council of Churches. In 1972 he was the president of the Swiss and diocesan synods. He was General Secretary of the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20Bishops%27%20Conferences%20of%20Europe">Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe</a> from 1977 to 1995. He became a cathedral deacon in 1991.

Fürer was elected bishop of St. Gallen on 28 March 1995 and appointed to that position the next day by <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>. He was consecrated a bishop on 5 June 1995 by Bishop Otmar Mäder with Bishops Henri Salina and <a href="Karl%20Lehmann">Karl Lehmann</a> as co-consecrators.

In 1995 Fürer and Cardinal <a href="Carlo%20Maria%20Martini">Carlo Maria Martini</a> of Milan guided the formation of group of about a dozen like-minded cardinals and bishops who met annually from 1995 to 2006 in St. Gallen to discuss church reforms, including the appointment of bishops, collegiality, bishops' conferences, the primacy of the papacy, and sexual morality. They differed among themselves, but shared the view that Cardinal <a href="Joseph%20Ratzinger">Joseph Ratzinger</a> was not the sort of candidate they hoped to see elected at the next conclave. Though some media reports discussed this as a conspiracy, Fürer said in 2015 that it was a circle of friends ("Freundeskreise") that at first discussed church policy and then also candidates for the papacy as the health of <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> declined. He said it last met in 2006.

As a member of the Swiss Bishops' Conference he was responsible for the Deaconate and Relief Services. Beginning in 1997 headed the Secretariat of the Council of European Bishops' Conferences since 1997.

He submitted his resignation on his 75th birthday, and <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> accepted it on 16 October 2005.

In 2005, the <a href="University%20of%20Fribourg">University of Fribourg</a> awarded him an honorary doctorate in recognition of his contribution to implementing the principles of the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a> in Switzerland and in Europe.

In 2007 the <a href="University%20of%20St.%20Gallen">University of St. Gallen</a> named him an Honorary Senator for "his important contribution towards the promotion of openness and tolerance across the borders of denominations and cultures".

From 1998 to 2009 he served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Fastenopfer, a Roman Catholic charity based in <a href="Lucerne">Lucerne</a> that fights hunger and poverty and promotes the development of a sustainable way of life.

Tempest Rogers

Tempest Rogers (1672-1704) was a pirate trader active in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and off <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. He is best known for his association with <a href="William%20Kidd">William Kidd</a>.

History.
Tempest Rogers was born in 1672 or 1675, and by 1693 had married Johanna Little in <a href="London">London</a>. Three years later he was master of the "Fidelia", sailing to the American colonies. He was suspected of sailing from <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> to <a href="Ile%20Ste.-Marie">St. Mary’s</a> on Madagascar, which had long been a known pirate trading post. He may have sailed alongside another Rhode Island pirate, <a href="Thomas%20Wake%20%28pirate%29">Thomas Wake</a>, who was also bound for Madagascar and the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> to eventually sail with <a href="Henry%20Every">Henry Every</a>.

Rogers was dispatched from London in 1697 to the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a> to set up a factory on behalf of the ship’s owners; on the way back in July 1698 he stopped at St. Mary’s again. While there William Kidd called on the port to switch his leaky "Adventure Galley" for his newly captured "Quedagh Merchant", renamed to "Adventure Prize". Rogers met with Kidd privately then offloaded troublesome crewman Edward Davis (or Davies), telling him he’d send a boat but putting to sea and abandoning Davis there instead. Davis sailed with Kidd rather than remain on Madagascar; once they returned to New York, he was arrested with the rest of Kidd’s crew and sent to London for trial. Acquitted, Davis returned to piracy by 1702 under the command of <a href="Nicholas%20Brown%20%28pirate%29">Nicholas Brown</a>.

When Kidd sailed to the Caribbean on his way back to New York before his capture, he stopped to offload a great deal of his captured loot. Rogers apparently met with Kidd and bought or took possession of his plunder, possibly by prior arrangement. Rogers then traded the "Fidelia" to William Symes (or Syms) for Symes’ own sloop; after sailing north, <a href="Richard%20Coote%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Bellomont">Governor Bellomont</a> of New York in 1699 seized the "Fidelia" on suspicion of carrying stolen goods. Bellomont thought Symes, a known criminal, may have murdered Rogers and stolen the "Fidelia". Rogers himself had been seized by Governor Read Elding of the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, and revealed that he’d sent his London backers over £27,000. Bellomont observed, “Tempest Rogers, it’s to be feared, was not sent from London on an honest design.”

By the early 1700s Rogers was living in <a href="Province%20of%20South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, likely in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>. Rogers died sometime on or before 1704, when his widow Johanna married Richard Oglethorpe, a “broken rascally fellow … a person of a very scandalous life.” Oglethorpe wrote a letter to Secretary of State <a href="Charles%20Hedges">Charles Hedges</a> (“An account of persons trading with pirates”) in which he repeated the accusations that Rogers had dealt with Kidd, naming others who he claimed had bought Kidd’s goods from Rogers, and claiming Rogers had bought <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Dutch</a> citizenship in order to trade with the French and Spanish as a neutral party. A few months later, Oglethorpe was granted administration of Rogers’ estate in South Carolina.

The area received protection in 1988 "to preserve an important wetland area with its habitat, bird life and other wildlife," according to the conservation regulations. The bay is a large shallow inlet with large tidal areas. Many streams empty into the bay, and together with drifting accumulations of seaweed and kelp this creates a basis for plentiful food for wildlife. The inner part of the bay is shielded by a belt of pebbles, where there are ponds and lagoons. The bay is a resting, nesting, and overwintering site for wetland birds. Twenty-one species of birds of regional importance have been observed here, 13 of national importance, and five of international importance. Ornithological studies and teaching take place in the area. The area is partially threatened by pressure from livestock on farms.

The wildlife sanctuary is one of six natural areas that were included in the <a href="Giske%20Wetlands%20System">Giske Wetlands System</a> <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar</a> site, which was established in 1996.

He is a member of the <a href="Warfalla">Warfalla</a> tribe, which was loyal to former Libyan ruler <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> and from which many members of Gaddafi's security forces were recruited. Al-Werfalli began his career in the <a href="Libyan%20Army%20%281951%E2%80%932011%29">Libyan Army</a> in 2000 after graduating from the country's military college. He eventually became a member of the elite al-Saiqa unit and remained a member when the <a href="Libyan%20Civil%20War%20%282011%29">Libyan Civil War</a> against Gaddafi's rule began in 2011. Soon thereafter al-Saiqa, under the command of Wanis Bukhmada, defected and joined the rebels.

Following the of Gaddafi's rule, al-Saiqa aligned itself with the Libyan National Army, led by <a href="Khalifa%20Haftar">Khalifa Haftar</a>, and fought against the <a href="Shura%20Council%20of%20Benghazi%20Revolutionaries">Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries</a> in and around the city of <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a> from 2014 to 2017 in a <a href="Battle%20of%20Benghazi%20%282014%E2%80%932017%29">battle for control</a> of the city. By at least 2017, al-Werfalli was a regional commander of al-Saiqa and oversees at least one detention center. In that year al-Werfalli gained international notoriety by appearing in videos posted by al-Saiqa's social media accounts that depicted him executing or ordering the execution of prisoners. One video is particular depicted the execution of 20 men. Al-Werfalli's actions were singled out by the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Human%20Rights">Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</a>, which documented several of these incidents and called for a full investigation.

International Criminal Court charge.
Mahmoud al-Werfalli was indicted on 15 August 2017 with the war crime of murder with regard to the situation in Libya. The arrest warrant against him alleges that he "appears to be directly responsible for the killing of, in total, 33 persons in Benghazi or surrounding areas, between on or before 3 June 2016 and on or around 17 July 2017, either by personally killing them or by ordering their execution." The arrest warrant notes that in seven incidents, which were videoed and posted on al-Saiqa's social media accounts, al-Werfalli either appeared to order the execution, or conducted the execution himself, of prisoners. The Court notes in the arrest warrant that "the executions were exceptionally cruel, dehumanising and degrading." Two days after the Court issued the warrant of arrest, the LNA announced that it had arrested al-Werfalli and that he was under investigation.

Terrorism in Turkey

<a href="Terrorism">Terrorism</a> in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> is a significant issue in the country and has developed over the past four decades. Causes for terror in Turkey range from its involvement in the Syrian Civil War to the Kurdish situation, to radical political elements in the country.

The majority of terrorist incidents in Turkey are concentrated mainly in Eastern, and South Eastern Turkey and big cities. Terrorism has had a negative impact of the country's tourism sector.

Turkey has had some success dealing with terrorism through political liberalization spurred by the process of joining the European Union.

History.
Two Armenian groups conducted a number of terror attacks aimed at Turkish diplomats, ASALA (<a href="Armenian%20Secret%20Army%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Armenia">Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia</a>) and JCAG (<a href="Justice%20Commandos%20of%20the%20Armenian%20Genocide">Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide</a>). These attacks spawned a period of ten years from 1975 to 1985. Their efforts were mostly based overseas, but some attacks occurred in Turkey such as the May 1977 bombing of the Istanbul airport and railway.

Left-wing terrorism began in 1969 when the Proletarian Revolutionaries and Proletarian Socialists formed the <a href="Revolutionary%20Youth%20Federation%20of%20Turkey">Federation of Revolutionary Youth of Turkey</a> (Dev-Genç). Terror activities included bank robberies, bombings and kidnappings (for ransom). In 1971, the military delared martial law to arrest revolutionaries.

From 1984 to 2000, an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 Turkish citizens were killed in terrorism-related incidents, during this period, the <a href="Kurdistan%20Workers%27%20Party">Partiya Karekeren Kurdistan</a> (PKK), a <a href="Kurds">Kurdish</a> separatist group (re-named KADEK in 2002), was responsible for the vast majority of terrorist attacks. These attacks disproportionately affected the eastern and southeastern regions of Turkey, where the PKK focused its activities.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Jihadist terrorism in Turkey was an isolated phenomenon represented by the <a href="Turkish%20Hezbollah">Turkish Hezbollah</a> and the <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Islamic%20Raiders%27%20Front">Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front</a>. Since the 2000s, there has been a rise in attacks from Islamist groups, some with links to Al-Qaeda. One group that has been studied by researchers is the Turkish Hizballah. Other attacks, like the <a href="2017%20Istanbul%20nightclub%20shooting">2017 Istanbul nightclub shooting</a>, were perpetrated by <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State</a>.

Initially, the Turkish government avoided labelling ISIL as a terror organization.

The <a href="Dokumac%C4%B1lar">Dokumacılar</a> is an Islamic terrorist group composed of about 60 Turkish militants who joined ISIL. The group is responsible for the <a href="2015%20Suru%C3%A7%20bombing">2015 Suruç bombing</a> which resulted in 32 deaths.

Effects on voting behavior.
One study found that it appears that Turkish voters are highly sensitive to terrorism and that they blame the government for casualties. Additionally, exposure to terrorism leads to an increase in the vote share of the right-wing parties.

Reading Tutoring

Reading tutoring is supplemental reading practice that occurs outside of the school reading curriculum. It usually has some type of consistent structure and can take place at a school, a tutoring center, or at home. The tutor can be a professional, paraprofessional, volunteer, or family member. Reading Tutoring can be used for all ages, and is dependent on reading ability and/or level.



U.S. Legislation that impacts reading tutoring.
In response to the high rate of students reading below their grade level in the United States, the America Reads Challenge Act of 1997 was proposed. Its main goal was to get children to appropriate reading levels by the time they left third grade (“America Reads Challenge Act,” 1997).3 
<a href="The%20No%20Child%20Left%20Behind%20Act%20of%202001">The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001</a> had the goal of getting all students to a proficient level in both reading and math by closing the achievement gap. It has now been replaced with the <a href="Every%20Student%20Succeeds%20Act">Every Student Succeeds Act</a> at the end of 2015. 

Research on the effectiveness of reading tutoring.
General.
Much of the research that can be found on tutoring programs is implemented in kindergarten, or first grade, through the third grade. Generally, empirical research finds that students who are tutored perform better on reading assessments at the end of the year relative to their untutored peers. Reading tutoring is usually geared toward students that are considered at-risk or below their grade level in reading achievement. To obtain the desirable higher achievement outcomes for students, tutors—volunteer, family members, and paraprofessionals—must be trained properly on reading correction procedures. 


Parents as tutors.
There are conflicting results in research on this subject. One study found that parents using either children’s books or school materials had no significant impact on the child’s reading achievement level (Powell-Smith et al., 2000). Other studies have found that when parents are trained in proper tutoring procedures they can positively impact their child’s reading achievement level

Fremont massacre

The Frémont massacre refers to the murder of several hundred <a href="Wintu%20people">Wintu people</a> on the banks of the <a href="Sacramento%20River">Sacramento River</a> on 5 April 1846 by an expedition band led by <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">Captain John C. Frémont</a> of Virginia.

History.
Background.
The expansionist movement of the 1840s motivated many Americans to work to push America's borders out into land claimed by Spain, Mexico, Britain, and Native American tribes. "Manifest Destiny", a term coined by journalist John O'Sullivan, captured the idea that the young American nation was destined to rule all of the North American continent. 

Democratic Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri was a prominent leader of this movement, into which he enlisted his son-in-law, John C. Frémont. Benton obtained government funding for several expeditions led by Frémont to map and explore the western territory.

In 1845, Captain Frémont was sent by the War Department on an expedition to survey the central Rockies. Frémont disobeyed orders and headed straight to California, a possession of Mexico, motivated by the desire to obtain "fame and power" in the American seizure of California that President James Polk had personally told him was imminent. Upon arriving in California, Frémont and his men moved about the northern half of the state for several months, provoking the Mexican authorities and building up patriotic sentiment among Americans who had settled there.
Incident.
On 30 March 1846, the band arrived at the Lassen Ranch in the upper Sacramento Valley. There they met Americans who claimed that an encampment of Indians was preparing to attack White settlers. Frémont moved his men up the Sacramento River in search of such Indians. The party reached Reading's Ranch (near present-day <a href="Redding%2C%20California">Redding, California</a>) on 5 April 1846 and spotted a large Indian camp, likely of the Wintu tribe. 

Captain Frémont ordered an advance on the Indians, with every one of his men carrying a rifle, two pistols, and a knife. The Wintu were unable to flee the camp as the majority of their ranks were women and children and they were pinned against the river. The men of the Wintu camp formed a defensive line with the women and children behind them.

Expedition member Thomas E. Breckenridge states that “the order was given to ask no quarter and to give none.” Frémont's men lined up and began firing several rifle volleys, slaughtering the Indians in front of them. The long range of the rifles rendered it impossible for the Indians' arrows to reach them. The men then approached towards the camp, fired another volley at closer range, and rushed in with their sabers and pistols. Breckenridge writes:

“The settlers charged into the village taking the warriors by surprise and then commenced a scene of slaughter which is unequalled in the West. The bucks, squaws and paposes were shot down like sheep and those men never stopped as long as they could find one alive.”

The remaining Indians were forced to flee, with some running for the hills and others braving the river. Eyewitness William Isaac Tustin reports that men of Frémont's band mounted on horses chased down the running Indians and tomahawked them to death, while riflemen stood on the shores of the river and took potshots at the Indians trying to swim to safety. He described the scene as "a slaughter."

Estimates of the casualties vary. Expedition members Thomas E. Breckenridge and Thomas S. Martin claim the number of Indians killed as "120-150" and "over 175" respectively, but the eyewitness Tustin claimed that at least 600-700 Indians were killed on land, with another 200 or more dying in the water. There are no records of any expedition members being killed or even wounded in the massacre. Kit Carson, one of the mounted attackers, later stated, "It was a perfect butchery." Breckenridge, who claims not to have participated, laments:

“I think that I hate an Indian as badly as anybody and have as good reason to hate them, but I don’t think that I could have assisted in that slaughter. It takes two to fight or quarrel but in that case there was but one side fighting and the other side trying to escape.”
Repercussions.
Neither Frémont nor any of his expedition members were charged or punished in any way for the killings. Several expedition members suggested that the massacre led local Indians to fear the White men and avoid raiding the settlements and ranches that American settlers had begun erecting on Indian land.
Aftermath.
Frémont and his band continued up the Sacramento River, killing Indians on sight as they went. The <a href="Klamath%20people">Klamath people</a> they met further north in <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a> eventually retaliated and killed 2-3 members of Frémont's party on the night of 9 May 1846, leading to the <a href="Klamath%20Lake%20massacre">Klamath Lake massacre</a> three days later.

On 9 May 1846 Frémont received word that war with Mexico was imminent. He quickly returned from Oregon to participate, killing several more Sacramento Valley Indians in the journey south. By August 1846 American military officers had fully occupied the northern half of the state, and by December all of modern California was under American control. John C. Frémont became Military Governor of California in January 1847, but was forced to give up the position less than two months later under disputed circumstances. In 1850 Frémont became California's first U.S. Senator. Frémont, who in the meantime had become wealthy off of gold mining claims, wrote a bill limiting gold mining claims to White citizens of the United States. In 1856 Frémont was nominated as the Republican candidate for President, losing the race to James Buchanan. He later fought as a Union general during the Civil War.

While some locals had admired the massacre, the wealthy landed settlers were beginning to depend on Indian labor in a sort of feudal system, with the Indians working both as free and as bonded labor. To some degree this saved the local Wintu from immediate annihilation, though smaller scale massacres occurred as early as the next year. By the 1850s, White American animosity at Indian possession of the land had built, and large-scale massacres involving hundreds of Wintu deaths recommenced, including the <a href="Kabyai%20Creek%20massacre">Kabyai Creek massacre</a>, the Old Shasta Town massacre and the Bridge Gulch massacre.

Monmouth Film Festival

The Monmouth Film Festival is an international film festival based out of <a href="Red%20Bank%2C%20New%20Jersey">Red Bank, New Jersey</a>, that first ran in December 2016. The festival is an opportunity for artists to have their work showcased and a forum for educational opportunities through workshops, networking, Q&As and special panels with industry guests. Monmouth Film Festival's platform allows filmmakers of all levels, including high and low budget works, to be seen, heard and interact with movie-goers, promoters and other artists. The festival’s mission is to connect independent artists and create an environment for artists to promote themselves and their work. The focus is on education, inspiration, and creativity. The festival has received submissions from all over the world by filmmakers of all levels of experience.

History.
The festival was founded in April 2016 by independent filmmaker, Nicholas Marchese. A twenty-something resident of Holmdel and filmmaker (his 2015 feature "My Brother’s Girlfriend" filmed on Red Bank, NJ locations that included the Dublin House and Riverside Gardens), Marchese founded the Monmouth Film Festival as a “by filmmakers, for filmmakers” gathering with a clear indie mission and strong sense of locale. 

Inaugural festival, December 2016.
Monmouth Film Festival premiered in Red Bank at the Two River Theater, December 16-19. A program delivered the weekend schedule that was designed in two blocks of ten 15-minute high-quality shorts. Between those blocks, the audience watched "Swim Team," a full-length feature documentary about parents who build and run a competitive swim team that offers the boys physical discipline, success, and meaning that changes their lives. This was followed in the evening by "Colby," a feature film whose dark theme became sad rather than depressing. The independent films selected were narrative, documentary and student films, short and feature-length, from all over the state, country and across the globe. The festival kicked off with a networking event, hosted an industry panel discussion and concluded with an awards ceremony.

Second annual festival, August 2017.
Monmouth Film Festival returned for year two August 11-13, 2017 at the <a href="Two%20River%20Theater">Two River Theater</a> in Red Bank. While the festival does not necessarily focus on homegrown projects, it offered a focus on works from the Monmouth County area. "Shooting Clerks" took home the Audience Choice award at the Monmouth Film Festival. In year 2, "spotlight feature films also included "Lemon", starring <a href="Michael%20Cera">Michael Cera</a> ("Juno", "Superbad", "Arrested Development"), directed by FX’s Atlanta director Janicza Bravo".

Awards and critical acclaim.
In a review of the inaugural festival, <a href="http%3A//www.tworivertimes.com">Two River Times</a> film critic Joan Ellis wrote, "The production quality, scripting, and acting of all the films was extremely high and the subject matter was refreshingly original". The festival was "awarded as one of the Top 100 best-reviewed festivals by FilmFreeway on their website, featuring over 5,000 festivals".

Shandana Minhas

Shandana Minhas (born on 26 October, 1975, in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>) is an award-winning writer.

Personal Life.
Shandana Minhas is the third of three children born to Mary (nee Khan) and Safdar Minhas. Coming from an interfaith background, Minhas has written extensively about the multicultural – and changing – nature of her society. Her family moved between Karachi, <a href="Hyderabad%2C%20Sindh">Hyderabad</a> and <a href="Daharki">Daharki</a> in the interior of Sindh until she was 9. She has lived in Karachi since then, barring a short stay in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. She attended St. Peter’s School, St. Michael’s Convent School and then Karachi Grammar School for her O and A Levels. Minhas dropped out of a small college in America after three semesters of undergraduate study, returning to Karachi to get a job instead.

She taught at a high school for four years. Minhas has also lectured at universities in Karachi. She was part of the resurgence in Pakistani media in the early 2000s, heading creative development for the Manduck Collective, Pakistan’s first independent production house, and writing for local papers.

The social and political landscape of Pakistan informs much of her work. Minhas has written about the difficulty as a Pakistani writer living through these times of remaining “a simple storyteller.” She has three children.

Writing.
Minhas has cited <a href="Daphne%20du%20Maurier">Daphne du Maurier</a>, <a href="Terry%20Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>, <a href="Frank%20Herbert">Frank Herbert</a>, <a href="John%20Irving">John Irving</a>, <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> and <a href="Saadat%20Hasan%20Manto">Sadaat Hasan Manto</a> as writers that have been important to her. She is an Honorary Fellow in Writing of the <a href="International%20Writing%20Program">International Writing Program</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Iowa">University of Iowa</a>. In addition to her own writing, Minhas set up Mongrel Books in Pakistan in 2016. 

Books.
Minhas’s first novel,"<a href="Tunnel%20vision%20%28disambiguation%29">Tunnel Vision</a>" (2007), is a first-person meditation on life as a woman in a man’s world. It was shortlisted for the <a href="Commonwealth%20Writers%20Prize">Commonwealth Writers’ Prize</a>, adapted for the stage by <a href="The%20Madras%20Players">The Madras Players</a> in 2009, and published in Italian as "Pakistan Graffiti" in 2012. It has been described as “piercingly witty and acutely perceptive” and a “silent bestseller”. In a review for the Sahara Times, New Delhi, in 2008, <a href="Namita%20Gokhale">Namita Gokhale</a> pointed out her “unblinking and acerbic” novelist’s vision.

Her second novel, "Survival Tips for Lunatics" (2014), is a “bitingly funny” adventure in which a bickering couple accidentally leaves their two sons behind on a camping trip in Pakistan’s turbulent Balochistan province. Alongside critical acclaim, it became the first children’s book to win a general fiction prize in the region, taking the French Embassy's <a href="Karachi%20Literature%20Festival">Karachi Literature Festival</a> fiction prize (honouring the best writing by a Pakistani or a writer of Pakistani origin worldwide) in 2015. 

Minhas’s third novel, "Daddy’s Boy" (2016), tells the story of Asfandyar Ikram, who has no idea that his father is alive - until the day he learns of his death. The book was well-reviewed by "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">The Hindustan Times</a>" (“…as hilarious as it is touching; one that’s totally bizarre while also being relatable”),"<a href="OPEN%20%28magazine%29">Open Magazine</a>" (“The tension builds, tightening like a stretched elastic band, until the shocking denouement, which casts ambiguity on the very title of the book. Starting on a note of laughter, the ending of this gripping novel elicits a gasp of horror”), and multiple other publications. On the cover blurb, Pakistani author <a href="Mohammed%20Hanif">Mohammed Hanif</a> called Daddy’s Boy “heartbreaking and hilarious”. Minhas has said she “wanted the prose and the rhythm to mimic the manic nature of our lives in Karachi, be suffused with it.”

Her fourth book will be the novella "Rafina". 

Other Works.
Minhas is primarily a novelist but has also written for stage, screen and opinion pages. Her short story, "The New Woman in the Old Flat," was published in the "Griffith Review"’s ‘New Asia Now’ issue showcasing “outstanding young writers from the countries at the centre of Asia’s ongoing transformation”, in 2015. Other stories have appeared in literary magazines such as "The Indian Quarterly", and "A Pakistani Homecoming" was published in "<a href="Dawn%20%28newspaper%29">Dawn</a>", the country’s most widely read newspaper, to mark the 70 anniversary of Independence.

Since 1997, Minhas has been a regular contributor to Pakistani and international publications.

Klamath Lake massacre

The Klamath Lake massacre refers to the murder of at least fourteen <a href="Klamath%20people">Klamath people</a> on the shores of <a href="Klamath%20Lake">Klamath Lake</a> on 12 May 1846 by a band led by <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a> and <a href="Kit%20Carson">Kit Carson</a>.

History.
Background.
The expansionist movement of the 1840s motivated many Americans to work to push America's borders out into land claimed by Spain, Mexico, Britain, and Native American tribes. "Manifest Destiny", a term coined by journalist John O'Sullivan, captured the idea that the young American nation was destined to rule all of the North American continent. 

Democratic Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri was a prominent leader of this movement, into which he enlisted his son-in-law, John C. Frémont. Benton obtained government funding for several expeditions led by Frémont to map and explore the western territory.

In 1845, Captain Frémont was sent by the War Department on an expedition to survey the central Rockies. Frémont disobeyed orders and headed straight to California, a possession of Mexico, motivated by the desire to obtain "fame and power" in the American seizure of California that President James Polk had personally told him was imminent. Upon arriving in California, Frémont and his men moved about the northern half of the state for several months, provoking the Mexican authorities and building up patriotic sentiment among Americans who had settled there. On 5 April 1846 Frémont and his men committed the <a href="Fr%C3%A9mont%20massacre">Frémont massacre</a> on the banks of the Sacramento River near present-day <a href="Redding%2C%20California">Redding, California</a>. They then proceeded north up the Sacramento River Valley and into <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a>.

Incident.
Frémont and his band had taken to killing Indians on sight as they traveled. Expedition member Thomas S. Martin stated in his memoirs, “We followed up the Sac. river killing plenty of game, and an occasional indian. Of the latter we made it a rule to spare none of the bucks.” Expedition member Thomas E. Breckenridge said that the men “had orders while in camp or on the move to shoot Indians on sight. While on the march the crack of a rifle and the dying yell of a native was not an unusual occurrence.” 

On the night of 9 May 1846 a band of 15-20 Klamath Indians retaliated and attacked Frémont’s group under cover of darkness, killing 2-3 members of the party. Frémont now “determined to square accounts with these people.” His scouts killed two Klamath braves on 11 May 1846, but Frémont considered that inadequate.

On 12 May 1846, Frémont’s assistant Kit Carson led an assault on a Klamath village named "Dokdokwas" on the shores of Klamath Lake. The assailants destroyed the village and killed at least 14 villagers, without taking a single casualty themselves.

Repercussions.
Neither Frémont nor any of his expedition members were charged or punished in any way for the killings. Orders from the U.S. government recalled Frémont back to California to participate in the war against Mexico, and he did not return to Oregon territory.

Aftermath.
Frémont and his band continued to kill Indians on sight on the way back down to California. John C. Frémont became Military Governor of California in January 1847, but was forced to give up the position less than two months later. In 1850 Frémont became California's first U.S. Senator. In 1856 Frémont was nominated as the Republican candidate for President, losing the race to James Buchanan. He later fought as a Union general during the Civil War.

The Klamath peoples continued to be subject to violence from White settlers, including a long string of similar massacres and attacks. By 1855, the Humboldt Times reported that miners were “determined to commence an indiscriminate massacre of all the Indians” in the Klamath watershed, while the Sacramento Daily Union reported that “people look upon it there as a war of extermination, and are killing all grown up males.” Judge Fletcher of Klamath County stated of fleeing Indians that “whites are hunting them down like deer.” Captain H.M. Judah reported men advocating, “the total extermination of all the Indians in this section.” 

In 1864 the Klamath people were forced to give up claims to twenty million of the twenty-two million acres they had lived on, with the remaining two million acres forming the Klamath Reservation. They became financially self-sufficient on this land, due to a profitable timber mill, cattle ranching, and other enterprises. In 1954 an Act of Congress (against the will of the Klamath people) terminated the tribal status of the Klamath, forcing them to give up their claim to the land and lose all federal services in exchange for a monetary payoff. In 1986 their tribal status was restored, but their land was not returned.

Zeulenroda unt Bf station

Zeulenroda unt Bf (Zeulenroda lower station) is a station in <a href="Zeulenroda-Triebes">Zeulenroda-Triebes</a> on the <a href="Werdau%E2%80%93Mehltheuer%20railway">Werdau–Mehltheuer railway</a> in the German state of <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>. In addition to the now disused upper station ("Zeulenroda oberen Bahnhof"), the town also includes the halt ("Haltepunkt") of <a href="Triebes">Triebes</a>.

History.
The station was opened as "Zeulenroda station" on 15 November 1883 together with the <a href="Werdau%E2%80%93Mehltheuer%20railway">Werdau–Weida–Mehltheuer railway</a>. It is located in the Zeulenroda district of "Untere Haardt". The <a href="Zeulenroda%20unt%20Bf%E2%80%93Zeulenroda%20ob%20Bf%20railway">town railway</a> ("Stadtbahn") to central Zeulenroda was opened on 1 September 1914. So there were two stations in Zeulenroda. The former station was renamed "Zeulenroda unt Bf" (short for "unterer bahnhof", lower station), the new station near the town centre was given the name on "Zeulenroda ob Bf" (short for "oberer bahnhof", upper station).

Passenger services on the town railway stopped on 1 June 1975, although they resumed in May 1993, before being finally closed on 2 June 1996. A year later, on 31 October 1997, freight traffic also ended on the town railway, so that Zeulenroda unt Bf again operated as a through station.

Although the station is located in Thuringia, the lines were built by the <a href="Royal%20Saxon%20State%20Railways">Royal Saxon State Railways</a> ("Königlich Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen"), so that the brick buildings were built in the typical style of Saxony. The station was equipped with three platforms, a two-storey entrance building with a one-storey annex, a <a href="goods%20shed">goods shed</a> and head and side <a href="Loading%20dock">loading ramps</a>. Two loading roads were also available for freight transport.

The water loading facility was demolished in 1986. Colour-light signals and a signal box built with Soviet EZMG technology were installed In 1987. The freight shed was demolished in 1996.

The municipality acquired the station building for €25,000 in 2008. Reconstruction of the station, including the demolition of the entrance building, began in 2010.

Plagues (Band)

Plagues is an American <a href="hardcore">hardcore</a> band from <a href="California">California</a> formed in 2010. Their current lineup is a five piece with Leo Ulfelder on Vocals, Matt Haynes on Guitar, Alex Schultz on drums, Buddy Porter on second guitar and former guitarist Ryan Doria on Bass. The band's style blends <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> with <a href="powerviolence">powerviolence</a>.

History.
Plagues formed in the fall of 2010 by Ulfelder, Schultz, Haynes, and Doria in Long Beach, California outside of a show at the now-closed Unity Church on Fourth Street from the remnants of their former band, Terezodu. Their intent was to create a <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> band that implemented facets of <a href="powerviolence">powerviolence</a>, <a href="grindcore">grindcore</a> and <a href="doom%20metal">doom metal</a> within their music. Ryan Doria would assume the role of second guitarist and Brian Follick was recruited to play bass guitar. They salvaged unused songs from Terezodu and began writing for their seven song <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a>, "Plagues", recorded by Doria in his garage in Anaheim, CA and released it on April 15th, 2011.

On April 29th, 2011, the band opened for Steve Ignorant's Crass at the Fox Theater Pomona under their former name, Terezodu, only to announce their new band on stage and play their 7 song EP in its entirety.
Shortly after, Doria left the band to pursue other endeavors and the band remained a four piece until 2012.

At the end of 2011, Plagues signed to Irish Voodoo Records and released a vinyl split with Orange County Hardcore band The Cold Front on March 20, 2012 as well as a repressing of their self-titled EP on vinyl. Several months after its release, Buddy Porter was recruited to play second guitar. The band would then write three songs and perform a cover for their second EP "I: Age of Viral Origin" released February 9th, 2012 on digital format. In the Winter of 2012, Plagues signed to Glory Kid Ltd. and released their second EP "Perfect State" on June 18th, 2013 on vinyl and digital format. Follick would then part ways with the band, leaving the roll of bass unfilled and putting the band on a hiatus for three years.

Ulfelder reformed Plagues in May of 2016 with Ryan Doria rejoining to fill the roll of permanent bass player, completing the lineup as a five-piece band.

Terrorism in the British Indian Ocean Territory

The British Indian Ocean Territory, sometimes known as the <a href="Chagos%20Archipelago">Chagos Archipelago</a> has had many threats of occupation by various groups, especially the since the <a href="Depopulation%20of%20Chagossians%20from%20the%20Chagos%20Archipelago">Depopulation of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago</a>, as well as being a a joint UK-US facility that is used in countering terrorism. The UK maintains there is a low risk of terroism in this territory.

"Secret" Prison.
In 2008 it was exposed in <a href="TIME">TIME</a> magazine by <a href="Lawrence%20Wilkerson">Lawrence Wilkerson</a> that a secret <a href="War%20on%20Terror">War on Terror</a> prison had existed on the island of <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a> had existed from 2002–2006. He claimed that Diego Garcia was used by the <a href="CIA">CIA</a> for "nefarious activities". He said that he had heard from three US intelligence sources that Diego Garcia was used as "a transit site where people were temporarily housed, let us say, and interrogated from time to time" and, "What I heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure, or unavailable at the moment".

In June 2004, the British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="Jack%20Straw">Jack Straw</a> stated that United States authorities had repeatedly assured him that no detainees had passed in transit through Diego Garcia or were disembarked there.

Diego Garcia was first rumoured to have been one of the locations of the <a href="CIA">CIA</a>'s <a href="black%20sites">black sites</a> in 2005. <a href="Khalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> is one of the "<a href="high-value%20detainees">high-value detainees</a>" suspected to have been held in Diego Garcia.
In October 2007, the <a href="Foreign%20Affairs%20Select%20Committee">Foreign Affairs Select Committee</a> of the British Parliament announced that it would launch an investigation of continued allegations of a prison camp on Diego Garcia, which it claimed were twice confirmed by comments made by retired United States Army General <a href="Barry%20McCaffrey">Barry McCaffrey</a>. On 31 July 2008, an unnamed former White House official alleged that the United States had imprisoned and interrogated at least one suspect on Diego Garcia during 2002 and possibly 2003.

The existence of the site was confirmed by US general <a href="Barry%20McCaffrey">Barry McCaffrey</a>, and Swiss Senator <a href="Dick%20Marty">Dick Marty</a>.. Also, <a href="Manfred%20Nowak">Manfred Nowak</a>, one of five of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Special%20Rapporteur">United Nations Special Rapporteur</a> on <a href="torture">torture</a>, says that credible evidence exists supporting allegations that ships serving as black sites have used Diego Garcia as a base. The human rights group <a href="Reprieve%20%28organisation%29">Reprieve</a> alleges that United States-operated ships moored outside the <a href="territorial%20waters">territorial waters</a> of Diego Garcia were used to incarcerate and torture detainees.

The United Kingdom government, who lease the island to the US, denied any knowledge of the incident, saying that two prisoners had passed through Diego Garcia but the plane they were on had only stopped to refuel. Nasar's location is still unknown since his arrival on Diego Garcia was announced in Spanish newspaper "<a href="El%20Pais">El Pais</a>".

On December 9, 2014, the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Intelligence%20Committee">United States Senate Intelligence Committee</a> published a 600-page unclassified summary of its 6,700 page secret report on the CIA's abuse of its secret prisoners.
David Jones, writing in the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>", expressed surprise that Diego Garcia went entirely unmentioned on every page of the unclassified summary, and speculated that pressure from UK security agencies caused the portions of the report that covered CIA prisoner facilities on the island to remain classified.

<doc id="54919920" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54919920" title="Stemma codicum of Aristotle's Metaphysics">
Stemma codicum of Aristotle's Metaphysics

The stemma codicum of the <a href="Metaphysics">Metaphysics (Aristotle)</a> is a visual representation with the shape of a family tree, which is the standard one in <a href="stemmatics">stemmatics</a>, It is meant to show the relationships of the surviving manuscripts of the Greek text, with special reference to those which are to be taken into account for a <a href="critical%20edition">critical edition</a>, hence for translations in modern languages, commentaries and for any other kind of scholarly reference to the text of the Metaphysics. It is partly conjectural by its own nature and it is an object of lively debate, since these latest years especially. 
The main controversial question the stemma is meant to answer is the role of the so called beta group of manuscripts of the <a href="Metaphysics%20%28Aristotle%29">Metaphysics</a>, described as a separate beta branch in the stemma. Special focus is on manuscript Ab (Laur. 87.12), as opposed to the alpha group of manuscripts (which forms the main part of the tree) and especially to its oldest representative, namely J (Wien Phil. Gr. 100) and E (Paris. Gr. 1853).
The first partial draft of a stemma, including Ab, E, J, has been produced in 19th c. by A. Gercke in 1894.
On this basis, 20th century editors, Ross 1924 and Jaeger 1957, have taken into account eclectically Ab in the one side and J and E on the other.

Different versions of the stemma codicum of the <a href="Metaphysics%20%28Aristotle%29">Metaphysics</a> have been proposed since 1970 (Silvio Bernardinello, Eliminatio codicum della Metafisica di Aristotele) 
, most remarkably by Dieter Harlfinger in 1979.

According to Harlfinger’s stemma, current 20th century editions of the Metaphysics (Ross, Jaeger) rely on the most valuable manuscripts for most of the fourteen  books, except for the last ones: starting from the final part of the 12th book, they should not have used Ab, but other beta manuscripts instead (M, C), which form no longer a unified group with Ab.

In 2010 Silvia Fazzo suggested a revision of Harlfinger stemma according to which manuscript Ab should not be followed in the whole of book 12 either, nor in the final part of book 11. She showed that starting from book 11 chapter 8 already Harlfinger’s supposed beta manuscripts Ab, M, C do not form any unified group. 

In 2015 Pantelis Golitsis replied to Fazzo’s revision showing that starting from book 11 chapter 8 manuscripts M and C can not be regarded as representative of a separate beta branch. Based on unpublished new collations funded by the DFG Golitsis shows that M and C are heavily collated (other would say ‘contaminated’ in this case) with various sources including late manuscripts of the  alpha group (when this kind of collation is concerned, Golitsis argues that the idea of contamination should be left aside and rejected).  He then submit a revised version of Harlfinger’s stemma codicum. 

In 2015 Fazzo further argued that neither Ab nor its cognate manuscripts M and C should be followed at all as long as the reading of J and E is not proved to be corrupt. Based on published and available materials she submit a different stemma where all manuscripts ultimately stem from a unique source, possibly from the same archetype ‘pi’ (Greek) of manuscripts J and E directly derive from. As a consequence, a critical editor is left with manuscripts J and E as the most reliable basis. In 2017 Fazzo submits her stemma to discussion in the Revue d’Histoire des Textes, prefaced with a general history of the stemma codicum of the Metaphysics. There she agrees with Golitsis vs. Harlfinger that manuscripts M and C should not be regarded as representative of an independent beta source for the final books of the Metaphysics Moreover, Fazzo argues that the bifid shape of 20th proposals concerning the stemma codicum heavily depends from implicit acceptance of Jaeger genetic views as applied to the manuscripts tradition of the Metaphysics.

CORYS

CORYS ("Compagnie de Réalisation Industrielle de Simulateurs", "Company of Industrial Conception of Simulators") is a supplier of training and engineering, <a href="Simulation">simulators</a> founded in 1997 and based in <a href="Grenoble">Grenoble</a>, France. CORYS, whose shareholders are <a href="AREVA">AREVA</a>, <a href="EDF">EDF</a> and IFP Training, has its own subsidiaries in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> (CORYS Inc.) and in <a href="China">China</a> (HKD). The company also has joint-ventures in <a href="India">India</a> and in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>.

History.
In 1997, CORYS T.E.S.S (Training and Engineering Support Systems) was founded when the assets of CORYS S.A were bought out by Tractebel Engineering and Technicatome. At the time, CORYS was developing a project with Tractebel and SIEMENS for 8 simulators to train operators of the Russian VVER 440MW power plants in Eastern Europe.

In 1998, CORYS T.E.S.S founded its subsidiary CORYS T.E.S.S Inc. (CTI) in Chicago (U.S.) to develop the simulator for the high speed train Acela for Amtrak.

In 1999, CORYS T.E.S.S’ business remained largely in the power sector but the company won several major contracts in the USA and Australia which helped the company break into the rail transport sector. 

In 2007, CORYS T.E.S.S decided to set up a subsidiary called BKRT for Beijing KERUITAI. This subsidiary was intended to develop a verification and validation simulator for the Ling Ao II power plant in Shenzhen.

In 2008, Ralf Gathmann, became the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of CORYS T.E.S.S.
The same year, CORYS T.E.S.S bought out Thunder Simulation Inc. based in St Marys, Georgia (USA) which merged with CORYS T.E.S.S Inc. in Chicago to become CORYS Thunder Incorporation. 

In 2009, Tractebel Engineering withdrew from CORYS' capital. AREVA and EDF became shareholders of the Grenoble company, CORYS T.E.S.S, respectively holding 66% and 34% of the company's capital. As a result, CORYS T.E.S.S changed legal status to become a "Société par Action Simplifiée" (Simplified Joint-stock company). 

CORYS T.E.S.S Grenoble moved in 2011 9 to new premises, in the scientific zone of Grenoble "Polygone Scientifique" close to the CEA, CNRS, Synchrotron (ESRF) and many others. The 5 850m2 building, called the Mistral, respects the label "low energy consumption".

In February 2015, the shareholders voted for a return to the name CORYS (dropping T.E.S.S). Shortly after, CTI moved to Jacksonville in Florida and was renamed CORYS Inc.

In April 2016, the end of big power projects in China led to the decision to close the Chinese subsidiary.

On the 1st July 2017, Corys became 100% owner of RSI by contribution of the shares. On the 1st October, RSI aims to merge with Corys and move into Corys' premises in Grenoble. Corys is now owned by Areva (50%), EDF (25%) and IFP Training (25%) as well as owning two subsidiaries (Corys Inc., USA & HKD, China) and a joint-venture in India and Cyprus (HyperionRSI Simulation).

French Tech in the Alps.
French Tech is an accreditation awarded to French cities recognized for their startup ecosystem. It is also a name used by technologically innovative French businesses throughout the world. Grenoble was amongst the first nine cities to get the award in 2014 .

CORYS is a member of the corporate network for French Tech in the Alps, the name of Grenoble's French Tech award. 

Less than 2 years after receiving the award, French Tech in the Alps launched a project in March 2016 called the "Digital Campus in the Alps". The initiative was taken by CORYS. In partnership with the French employment agency, AGEFOS-PME and the CNAM (Conservatoire National des arts et des métiers) of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, the campus aims to train about thirty people over 18 months in the digital skills that companies are looking for.

Because of the previous colour scheme the units are popularly nicknamed "kanarček" (<a href="Yellow%20canary">canary</a>).

History.
The units were designed in the <a href="MBB%20Donauw%C3%B6rth">MBB Donauwörth</a> company in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> with cooperation of Yugoslav engineers. The first five sets were built in MBB Donauwörth and finished in the <a href="TVT%20Boris%20Kidri%C4%8D%20Maribor">TVT Boris Kidrič Maribor</a> factory, and the rest of them (22 sets) were built in Maribor.

The series was built in two versions, as a first-class business train (5 sets of subseries 713-0xx, in green colour scheme, with 92 seats, a kitchen and loudspeakers) and as a standard commuter train (22 sets of subseries 713-1xx, in yellow-and-orange colour scheme, with 128 seats). All of the business trains were later converted into standard trains, and the colour scheme of all units is gradually being changed into red.

<doc id="54919981" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54919981" title="Johanneskirche">
Johanneskirche

The Johanneskirche (Church of St. John) is a catholic church located in <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg im Breisgau</a>. It was first opened in 1899 and is currently located in the <a href="Wiehre">Wiehre</a> district. Around the church, further historic buildings were built. On the western side is the presbytery of the community next to a vocational school and to the north is the Lessingschule. At the same time as the Johanneskirche was being completed, the Protestant Christians built their own church near to Johanneskirche, the Christuskirche.
History.
After the Wiehre district had joined with Freiburg in 1825, a large construction project took place. The population rapidly grew within a few decades. Since the Church of St. Cyriakus and Perpetua was only designed for less than 200 people, the church was no longer adequate for the rising population figures. This led to a decision being made to build a new church in 1889. The client was the domain directorate, subordinated to the Ministry of Finance of the Grand Duchy of Baden. The contract was given to building manager Josef Durm. The Ministry rejected its draft because of its costs. In order to accommodate the required space on a smaller site, the Ministry of Finance called for galleries. Durm and the church initially rejected this as unsuitable for a Catholic church since the faithful in the gallery could not participate appropriately during mass. Churches with galleries were only considered suitable for Evangelical preaching services. Finally, Durm gave in. The city council was also involved in designing the church. Durm's next draft, in Romanesque-early Gothic style, seemed to be too much in competition with the Minster. Durm then changed his design and emphasised more strongly the Romanesque sections. He designed the towers to be taller and later added them to another storey. Construction served to mark the town-planning guiding principle under Lord Mayor Otto Winterer to mark the expanding of the city of Freiburg by towering buildings.

Construction work on a site near to the <a href="Dreisam">Dreisam</a>, on which the first gasworks had stood, began in 1894 and ended when the church was consecrated in 1899. In order to make good use of the existing site for a church with 900 seats, the church was designed with a very wide central nave (11m) and two side aisles (each 3.5m) with galleries. The length of the building is 74.3m. The crossing of the nave and the transept has a diameter of 16.8m.

The building is decorated in red sandstone and resembles the typical features of <a href="Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture">new Romanesque</a> architecture, which included elements of late <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> churches. Unlike older churchers, Johanneskirche is not orientated to the east, with the alter located to the west. The facade, whose entrance is shaped in the form of an octagon, is flanked by two towers about 60m high with very steep spires pointing eastwards towards Talstraße, which forms a long line of sight for the church.

Architect Josef Durm, in a letter addressed to the Finance Directorate, described Bamberg Cathedral as a model for the new chirch, with mainly relates to the exterior view to the east with the entrance apse flanked by two towers. On the other hand, both the <a href="floor%20plan">floor plan</a> and the interior are clearly different from the aforementioned model. "The architect has found his idols rather in late Romanesque of the Lower and Upper Rhines. (...) Durm arrives (...) at an independent solution so that a direct derivation from a late-Romanesque building is not possible".

The church's glass windows were created by Freiburg artist Fritz Geiges between 1898 and 1901.

After the interior was renovated between 1971 and 1973, <a href="Crossing%20%28architecture%29">crossings</a> with the alter island and celebration made by Joseph Henger were redesigned in 1975. A further exterior renovation (especially the roof, but also damage to the masonry, windows etc) took place from 2006 to 2008.

The former Fourteen Holy Helpers' chapel.
In the Johanneskirche, there is still an old painting depictng the Fourteen Holy Helpers. It originated in the defunct chapel as well as two Baroque figures and a medieval Madonna. These were located on the modern-day Basler Straße, between Heinrich-von-Stephan-Straße and the railway underpass.

The modern day.
The community of St. John, alongside the community of St. Cyriak and Perpetua, whose church is also called "Annakirche", the "Liebfraugemeinde" in Günterstal and the "Maria-Hilf" community in the Upper Wiehre formed the pastoral unit of Freiburg-Süd. The pastoral unit was supervised by <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor">Order of Friars Minor</a> from Poland from 2005 to 2013, who were located in the Franciscan monastery at Günterstalstraße.

Organ.
The organ on the church's eastern gallery was built in 1981 by organ builder Metzler (Dietikon, Switzerland). The organ has 50 stops (3536 pipes) on three keyboards and pedals. In addition to the main console, the organ also has a figured bass console in the lower section of the positive organ with a pedal attached. Tjos console is independent of the main console so that two organ players can play music on two organ consoles. The organ has mechanical and registered tracker actions.

<doc id="54919987" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54919987" title="Body worn video (police equipment)">
Body worn video (police equipment)

In <a href="policing">policing</a> <a href="equipment">equipment</a>, body worn video (abbreviated to BWV, and also known as a body camera, body-worn camera, or wearable camera) is a <a href="Wearable%20technology">wearable</a> audio, video, or photographic recording system used to record events in which <a href="police%20officer">police officer</a>s are involved. They are typically worn on the torso of the body.

Definition.
The definition used in a market survey prepared for the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> in 2016 is that body worn cameras "are cameras with at least one microphone and internal data storage, and allow audio/video footage to be stored and analyzed with compatible software. The cameras are typically located on the police officer's chest or head".

Usage in law enforcement.
Wearable cameras are often utilized by law enforcement to record their interactions with the public or gather video evidence at crime scenes. It has been known to increase both officer and citizen accountability, although arguments have been made that BWVs primarily protect police. Parking inspectors in particular areas also wear these devices to capture an assault or offense. BWVs are notable because of their placement, often on the front of a shirt, provides a first-person perspective and a complete chain of evidence. BWV is a form of <a href="closed-circuit%20television">closed-circuit television</a>. 

Specific adaptations for police use.
Current body cameras are much lighter and smaller than the first experiments with wearable cameras. There are several types of body cameras made by several different companies. Each camera basically serves the same purpose, yet some function in slightly different ways than others. Some are meant to be mounted on one’s chest or shoulder while others can work as an attachment to glasses or may be worn in a function similar to a headband or on a helmet. As far as sizing goes, "most are roughly the size of a <a href="Scotch%20Tape">Scotch Tape</a> <a href="Tape%20dispenser">dispenser</a> and weigh anywhere from about 2 ounces (55 grams) to 5 ounces (140 grams). That's somewhere between a large <a href="strawberry">strawberry</a> and a <a href="lemon">lemon</a>." These lightweight cameras are designed to be worn comfortably.

The various needs and budgets of police departments have led to a wide range of body camera equipment to be offered in recent years. Body camera manufacturers have constantly looked for technical innovations to improve their products to ensure the most professional and useful results. Each company has their own specific reasons for providing certain features in their body cameras. Axon cameras, similar to other body cameras on the market, were created for the purpose of ensuring public safety through obtaining the truth behind actions carried out by law enforcement agencies. Taser chose not to include the use of HD video quality in their first model because the video files were five to ten times larger than a regular resolution of 640 x 240. Vievu found that HD video quality serves as a great help when evidence is presented in courtrooms due to the viewer’s ability to get a clearer picture of what occurred. The Axon Body 2 that was introduced later does support HD recording. Factors like these are addressed by each company throughout the process of designing and producing their body cameras. Many body cameras offer specific features that include options of HD footage, infrared, night vision, fisheye lenses, and varying degrees of view. Ever since body cameras have been worn by police officers, there has been a debate over whether video qualities that make the camera superior to that of the officer’s eyes should be allowed. One of these main features is night vision and has led companies to question whether to incorporate such features into their products.

Another important innovation is buffering: several body cameras can be set to "pre-record". The cam continually records and stores the most recent 30 seconds. Unless the officer pushes the record button, the recording will be deleted on a 'first in, first out' basis. This makes it possible to record what happened before an actual confrontation if the officer does not press the record button before an escalation. The buffered video and audio may provide more context. New features are constantly being implemented into the cameras and the data-storage process. Because the amount of data stored can quickly become overwhelming, important innovations have to do with Video Content Analysis, facial recognition, and automatic triggers to start recording, for instance, if a weapon is pulled from a holster or when an officer starts running or falls down.

Policing benefits.
Body cameras can also have benefits, both direct and indirect. They can, for instance, save police time in the reconstruction of incidents or gathering of evidence. In addition, just as there are indirect costs, there can be indirect benefits. For instance, if violence against police officers decreases because of body cameras, not only does this reduce medical costs and the number of days off needed to recover; it can also have sizeable psychological and emotional benefits. If the number of complaints goes down, this means that less time has to be spent on reviewing and investigating what actually happened. If the number of suspects that offer an early guilty plea goes up, this can save considerable amounts of time that would otherwise have been necessary to gather evidence. Another benefit also includes “recognizing patterns of officer behavior”, which means that there can be more analysis into how officers interact with citizens, and how they handle situations. If certain tactics or approaches aren’t working, they can be changed after analyzing the recordings to find a better solution. Other benefits may include increased job satisfaction of police officers, a decrease in fear of crime of citizens or a boost in the legitimacy of the police. Most of these indirect benefits are difficult to express in monetary terms, but that does not make them less real or valuable.

Based on the application of body worn video by the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Police%20Department">New Orleans Police Department</a>, body worn video has shown to decrease the number of “dropsies” cases, increase the accountability of the police officers and their practices, and has given defendant’s an extra tool to defend themselves with. “Dropsies” are cases in which “police claim to have seen a defendant drop or discard illegal drugs, which justifies the arrest”. The <a href="Orleans%20Public%20Defenders">Orleans Public Defenders</a>' chief of trials, Danny Engelberg, argues that these cases are less one-sided because there is now video to complement, or counter, the officer’s written report. Engelberg says the "videos are being recorded regularly, and the cameras have had a positive effect of police conduct".

All costs and benefits, including indirect costs and benefits, have to be weighed against each other in a <a href="cost-benefit%20analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a>, to be able to judge whether body cameras lead to a positive or negative business case. The police in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, United Kingdom, predicted a positive business case within two years after their investment of £1.8 million in body cameras, purely because of a reduction in the number of complaints.

Real-time placing of officers.
During incidents, command centers are able to pinpoint officers' locations in real time based on body cameras' ability to stream live video to a Veretos Cloud, making them much more strategic in placement of officers due to being more situationally aware of the area and what the officers are actually seeing in real time.

History.
The first generation of 'modern' police body cameras was introduced around 2005 in the United Kingdom. That means these cameras have only been around for a relatively short period of time and thus have not been perfected yet.

United Kingdom.
Body-worn video cameras received wide media coverage because of the first testing of body-worn cameras in the United Kingdom in 2005. The test was begun on a small-scale by <a href="Devon%20and%20Cornwall%20Police">Devon and Cornwall Police</a>. In 2006, the first significant deployments of body worn video at the national level were undertaken by the <a href="Police%20Standards%20Unit">Police Standards Unit</a> (PSU) as part of the Domestic Violence Enforcement Campaign (DVEC). The basic command units equipped with the head cameras recorded everything that happened during an incident from the time of arrival which led to the "preservation of good-quality first disclosure evidence from the victim". The evidence gathered was deemed especially useful in the way of supporting prosecutions if the victim was reluctant to give evidence or press charges.

This led the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> to publish a report stating that "evidence gathering utilising this equipment has the potential radically to enhance the police performance at the scene of a wide range of incidents". In the same report, the Home Office concluded that the body worn camera system used in Devon and Cornwall had "the ability to significantly improve the quality of the evidence provided by police officers at incidents". However, mostly due to the limitations of the then available technology, it was also recommended that police forces should await the completion of successful trials and projects to re-evaluate the technology before investing in cameras. By July 2007, the Home Office was beginning to encourage the emerging industry and published another document entitled "Guidance for the Police use of Body Worn Cameras". The report was based on the first national pilot of BWV conducted in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>. <a href="Tony%20McNulty">Tony McNulty</a> MP, Minister of State for Security, Counter-Terrorism and Police wrote a foreword that held BWV in a promising light: "The use of body-worn video has the potential to improve signiﬁcantly the quality of evidence provided by police ofﬁcers…video recording from the scene of an incident will capture compelling evidence…that could never be captured in written statements." Despite being hailed as a tool to enhance the quality of evidence, the focus was beginning to shift away from exclusively benefitting prosecutions. The Home Office highlighted that BWV also had the significant potential to "prevent and deter crime". In addition, the final report on the National Pilot for BWV announced that complaints against the officers wearing the cameras had been reduced to zero and time spent on paperwork had been reduced by 22.4%, which led to a 9.2% increase in officer time spent on patrol ("50 minutes of a 9-hour shift").

Following the national pilot, BWV began to gain some traction in the UK and, by 2008, Hampshire Police began to use the technology in parts of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> and the mainland. These were the first steps that paved the way for Chief Constable Andy Marsh becoming the national lead for BWV. Pioneers of BWV in the UK began to drive the need to review the legislation surrounding the use of the equipment. In 2009 the <a href="Security%20Industry%20Authority">Security Industry Authority</a> concluded that a CCTV license could be extended to cover the use of a body camera. The summary stated that a CCTV license was required to review footage from a body camera and that a door supervision or security guard license was required to operate a body camera if security activities were also being performed.

In 2010, 5  years after the first BWV venture, over 40 UK police areas were using body cameras to varying degrees. <a href="Grampian%20Police">Grampian Police</a> were one such force that initiated a trial in July 2010 which paved the way for the Paisley and Aberdeen body wore video project in 2011. The project was considered a huge success and it was identified that the benefits saved an estimated minimum of £400,000 per year due to the following:


The concluding sections of the report on the Paisley and Aberdeen project turned the attention to the digital, back-end solutions for BWV. Now that the benefits of using body cameras were being realized, the implications on the digital infrastructure were being called into question. The report suggested providing "robust central IT support" to have established the processes behind information gathering and monitoring.

In 2013 the Home Office released an updated code of practice for surveillance cameras, in which Principle 8 included the use of body cameras, stating: "Surveillance camera system operators should consider any approved operational, technical and competency standards relevant to a system and its purpose and work to meet and maintain those standards". 2013 also saw the start of Operation Hyperion, a Hampshire Police initiative on the Isle of Wight that equipped every frontline police officer with a personal issue body worn camera, the biggest project of its kind at the time. Sergeant Steve Goodier oversaw the project and was adamant that the project would drive legislative changes to free up further uses for body worn cameras. He said "I strongly believe we could make some small changes to legislation that can have a big impact on officers: "<a href="Police%20and%20Criminal%20Evidence%20Act%201984">PACE</a> was written in 1984 at a time when BWV was not around…We want to get the legislation changed so that BWV could replace the need for handwritten statements from officers when it is likely that an early guilty plea would be entered at court or that the incident could be dealt with a caution or community resolution."

In 2014, the Metropolitan Police Service began a 12 month trial in ten London boroughs, testing the impact of Body Worn Video on complaints, stop and search and criminal justice outcomes for violent offenses. Following the trial, the decision was made to issue body cameras to all officers who have regular engagement with the public. Other officers will be able to access cameras on an ‘as needed’ basis. A total of 22,000 cameras will be issued.

In 2016, the <a href="Police%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">Police Service of Northern Ireland</a> (PSNI) formally introduced body Worn Video technology commencing with Derry City and Strabane District, with Belfast becoming the second District to introduce the technology. A pilot Body Worn Video camera scheme was run during 2014/15, which illustrated the benefits of Body Worn Video. On that basis a business case was submitted to the Department of Justice and funding was secured to purchase Body Worn Video technology for officers across the service. In 2017, the Northern Ireland Prison Service implemented body worn video, following the success of the PSNI deployment.

United States.
In the aftermath of the <a href="shooting%20of%20Michael%20Brown">shooting of Michael Brown</a> and the <a href="death%20of%20Eric%20Garner">death of Eric Garner</a>, police use of body camera technology has become a topic of national debate.

On December 1, 2014, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> "proposed reimbursing communities half the cost of buying cameras and storing video—a plan that would require Congress to authorize $75 million over three years to help purchase 50,000 recording devices". He also asked Congress for a $263 million package overall to deal with community policing initiatives that would provide a 50 percent federal match for local <a href="police">police</a> departments to purchase body cameras and to store them. With the push from former President Barack Obama to “expand funding and training to law enforcement agencies through community policing initiatives”, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> announced in May 2015 that they would grant 73 out of the 285 awards requested for a total of 20 million dollars. This allowed for the purchase and distribution of 21,000 cameras to be placed in active duty. A National Institute of Justice report found this in regards to responding police agencies: "In a sample of police departments surveyed in 2013, approximately 75 percent of them reported that they did not use body-worn cameras". A November 2014 survey of police departments serving the 100 <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20cities%20by%20population">most populous cities</a>, <a href="Vocativ">Vocativ</a> found that "41 cities use body cams on some of their officers, 25 have plans to implement body cams and 30 cities do not use or plan to use cams at this time". The following cities have body camera technology in place: <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a> and <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, California; <a href="Denver">Denver</a> and <a href="Colorado%20Springs">Colorado Springs</a>, Colorado; <a href="Mesa%2C%20Arizona">Mesa</a>, Arizona; <a href="Albuquerque">Albuquerque</a>, New Mexico; <a href="Omaha">Omaha</a>, Nebraska; <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, <a href="Ft.%20Worth">Ft. Worth</a>, <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>, and <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, Texas; <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, Indiana; <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, Michigan; <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>; <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>; <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, Georgia; <a href="Hickory%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hickory</a>, North Carolina, and <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, Florida.

Following The Law Enforcement Officer-Worn Body Camera Act, the state of <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> became one of the first states to have a comprehensive set of rules for police departments in regards to body camera usage. The <a href="Chicago%20Police%20Department">Chicago Police Department</a> as well as the mayor of the city, <a href="Rahm%20Emanuel">Rahm Emanuel</a>, have been vocal about their plan to enact a body-worn camera expansion that would equip police officers by the end of 2017. The goal of this plan, as well as the hiring of more officers, is to improve public trust in the law, expand transparency, and halt the climbing number of homicides. <a href="Springfield%20Police%20Department%20%28Illinois%29">Springfield Police Department (Illinois)</a> has also been among the local departments that have expanded the use of body worn cameras despite the Springfield Police Chief Kenny Winslow stating that "there are still problems with the state body camera law, and many departments in Illinois aren’t adopting the cameras as a result". One of those departments is the Minooka Police Department that discontinued the use of body cameras because they felt overburdened by administrative responsibilities.

There have been studies on the use of body-worn cameras and the effect that these cameras have on police behavior. In <a href="Rialto%2C%20California">Rialto, California</a>, for example, police officers were to wear small body cameras at all times and record all working hours. According to the data, "The cameras cost about each. They can hold up to 12 hours of full-color footage and upload their footage via a cloud system. After one year researchers found that after requiring the Rialto police to wear the cameras complaints against officers from citizens dropped by 88% and "use of force" dropped by 59%". The findings of this research have led to debates concerning costs, rights, and the accuracy of the study. In New York City, for example, body-worn cameras could cost up to $31 million. However, cities such as Washington, D.C. report that body-worn cameras would save money by reducing lawsuits targeted towards the police force and by aiding in the dismissal of court cases with digital evidence provided by the recorded footage of the body-worn cameras. The <a href="University%20of%20South%20Florida">University of South Florida</a> released a report that studied the effects of body-worn cameras for the <a href="Orlando%20Police%20Department">Orlando Police Department</a> that lasted an entire year. The research found that for officers wearing the body cameras, use-of-force incidents dropped by 53%, civilian complaints dropped by 65%, two in three officers who wore the cameras said they’d want to continue wearing them in the future and that it made them "better officers".

Investigations have shown that although in many states the usage of body worn cameras is mandatory, there are several instances where some officers have failed to adhere to the law. From 2015 until now, there have been nationally recognized scenarios of fatal shootings in San Francisco, Alabama, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles in which the officer was wearing a body camera, but did not have it turned on. The <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a> is one of the first to publicly discuss solutions as to how they will try to fix this problem. Small reminders such as stickers in the station and cars are meant to remind officers to utilize this technology. In addition, Los Angeles Police Department is testing new technology that would activate the cameras at the same time as the officer turns on their emergency lights. The LAPD has also been working with the body camera manufacturer it uses, Taser International, to increase a buffer that saves video from 30 seconds before and after the camera is turned on and off.

Police unions in several U.S. cities, such as <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> (the <a href="Patrolmen%27s%20Benevolent%20Association">Patrolmen's Benevolent Association</a>, which represents the <a href="NYPD">NYPD</a>), <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, and <a href="Jersey%20City">Jersey City</a>, New Jersey, and <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, Missouri, expressed doubts or opposition to body cameras. Specifically, union officials expressed concerns about possible distraction and safety issues, and questioned "whether all the footage filmed by body cameras will be accessible via <a href="Freedom%20of%20information%20in%20the%20United%20States">public-records requests</a>, whether victims of <a href="domestic%20violence">domestic violence</a> will be hesitant to call police if they know they will be filmed and whether paying for the cameras and maintenance will lead to cuts elsewhere in the police budget". Others have worried about a "gotcha discipline". Some unions have argued that it was "mandatory" for police departments to include provisions about body-worn cameras in union contracts because it would be a "clear change in working conditions" as well as something that could "impact an officer's safety".

The <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> is an organization that has been a major proponent of body cameras on officers. The ACLU has advocated body camera use for both police departments and <a href="U.S.%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>, granted that safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of both officers and civilians. However, they have opposed the use of such systems for <a href="parking%20enforcement%20officer">parking enforcement officer</a>s, <a href="fire%20marshal">fire marshal</a>s, <a href="Building%20inspection">building inspectors</a>, or other <a href="code%20enforcement">code enforcement</a> officers. Some police departments in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, such as the <a href="Albuquerque%20Police%20Department">Albuquerque Police Department</a> and <a href="Rialto%20Police%20Department">Rialto Police Department</a>, have experimented with or deployed body-worn camera systems.

In 2012, the National Institute of Justice at the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> issued a primer regarding laws, policies, practices, and technology for local police departments to consider.

The debate on body-worn videos for police rages on. Some believe similarly to <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a> resident psychiatrist <a href="Keith%20Ablow">Keith Ablow</a>, who stated that it was an "insult to police officers" to provide them body cameras and additional de-escalation training. Others, such as <a href="Black%20Lives%20Matter">Black Lives Matter</a>, have released specific policy solutions to tackle the issue of police violence and escalation that include body cameras for police, limited use of force, and demilitarization of the police are a few of the ten crucial policies listed in <a href="Campaign%20Zero">Campaign Zero</a>. The debates on body worn cameras for police officers indirectly touches on the effects of the <a href="War%20on%20Drugs">War on Drugs</a> and violence where former President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> links the war on drugs to fueling more cycles of violence, Senator <a href="Rand%20Paul">Rand Paul</a> "compared the war on drugs to the racist policies of the Jim Crow era", and the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> released a report that states that "while marijuana use rates between blacks and whites are comparable, blacks are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession".

Canada.
Some police services in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> such as the <a href="Calgary%20Police%20Service">Calgary Police Service</a> have trialed body-worn video systems since 2012, and have recently adopted body-cameras for deployment by all officers beginning in 2017. Police unions in Canada have been opposed to body-worn video systems, citing privacy and cost concerns.
In 2015, several city police units including those in Winnipeg and Montreal announced plans to experiment with the technology. The <a href="Toronto%20Police%20Service">Toronto Police Service</a> started a pilot in 2014 with the technology during a year-long study of body-worn cameras. In total, 100 officers were using the technology from May 2015 thru May 2016. The evaluation report concluded that support for the body cameras was strong and increased during the pilot. There were technical issues, for instance with battery life, camera mounting, docking, recharging, ability to classify, ease of review and other issues. Administrative responsibilities associated with the body cameras resulted in significant commitment of time by officers that then was not available to spend on other duties. In September 2016, the Toronto police wanted to put out a call for proposals from suppliers.

Australia.
The number of body-worn cameras in use by the police of Australia is growing increasingly prevalent in parallel with other countries. The first bodycams or 'cop-cams' were trialed in Western Australia in 2007. Victoria has been trialing body-worn cameras since 2012, and in 2015 the NSW police announced they had invested $4 million in rolling out body-worn cameras to frontline police officers. According to research being conducted in 2016 'the use of body-worn cameras has now gathered traction in most Australian states and territories'.

Germany.
In some parts of Germany, police services have used body-worn video systems since 2013. Police in a growing number of regional states (the Länder) use bodycams. The rationale for the introduction of these cameras has overwhelmingly been to better protect police against violence from citizens. Another reason has been the fact that citizens are filming the police. As Rüdiger Seidenspinner, the president of the union of police officers for the State Baden-Württemberg, explained: "The reason is simple: our colleagues have had enough in this era of smartphones of being filmed only when they intervene. What caused the intervention, what actions, insults etc. took place does not seem to concern anyone. Furthermore, we will not use the BodyCam in all situations, but only for specific deployments and especially in areas with high levels of crime". According to a representative sample of 1,200 citizens from Germany in 2015, a majority of 71% is in favour of body cameras and 20% is opposed to the technology.

Detailed information is available on the use of body cameras in five Länder. In Hessen, the police were the first force in Germany to use body cams in May 2013. According to official registrations, the resistance (Widerstand) to police decreased from 40 to 25 and only one of the officers wearing a body camera was wounded, compared to nine colleagues without camera. Following the pilot, the number of bodycams acquired went up from the original 13 to 72 in total, also meant for other areas in Hessen. The success of the pilot inspired many other German cities and the national police to start using body cameras as well. Police from Hungary, Switzerland, and Austria were interested as well and asked the German police for information.

In Rheinland-Pfalz body, cams are in use since July 2015 in the cities of Mainz and Koblenz to reduce violence towards the police and to collect footage that can be used as evidence. The costs of these body cams was 18.500 euro. Based on the positive experiences, eighty more bodycams have been acquired to be deployed in more areas in these two cities. In Hamburg, one of five members in each team that surveils during weekends is equipped with a bodycam since June 2015. These cameras can be pointed in different directions by manually operated remote control. Since 2016, the Bavarian State Police have been testing bodycams in Munich, Augsburg and Rosenheim. The cameras have to be activated in critical situations and at dangerous locations, for instance in nightlife entertainment areas where fighting is a common occurrence. In Baden-Württemberg, bodycams are deployed in Stuttgart, Mannheim and Freiburg since 2016. The aim here is to test the bodycams during one year with the aim of reducing violence against the police.

Starting in February 2016, the German federal police is also testing bodycams at trainstations in Berlin, Köln, Düsseldorf and Munich.

France.
In France, national and municipal police will be outfitted with 2 600 body cameras in 2017, after experimentation during the previous years. The measure is intended to appease interventions and reassure the security forces. Formally, the goals of the cameras are:

The legal framework has been determined early in 2017 by the national committee on information and freedoms (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés - CNIL). Their opinion is that because of the elevated risks created by surveillance of persons and personal life that could result from the use of these cameras, a specific legal framework was necessary. Separate laws were developed for national police and gendarmerie and for municipal police.

Other organisations that will start using these small wearable cameras include the rail transportation (SNCF) and the regional public transport for Paris (RATP). Separate legislation has been developed for this type of law enforcement.

Netherlands.
The first body worn video used by the Dutch police were portable cameras used by the mounted riot-police in 1997. The first small-scale experiments with modern-day bodycams date back to 2008. Large-scale coordinated experiments were conducted from 2009 through 2011 and took place in four of the 25 regional police-forces. The pilot was aimed at reducing violence against the police. The results were disappointing, largely due to technical problems with recordings and 'wearability' of the equipment. Following this evaluation, the Department of Justice concluded that bodycams were not ready to be 'rolled out' on a larger scale.

Since then, however, regional and local experiments with bodycams have been undertaken. According to a survey conducted by the Dutch public broadcasting corporation (NOS) in 2011, 10 of the 25 regional police forces were using body worn video. One year later, that number had gone up to 17 of the 25 forces, according to one of the major suppliers of body worn video cameras in the Netherlands. In November 2015, the Dutch National Police published a programme regarding the integration of 'sensing' capabilities into police activities. The programme mainly focuses on CCTV, <a href="automatic%20number%20plate%20recognition">automatic number plate recognition</a> and bodycams. In 2017 and 2018, the Dutch National Police will conduct large-scale experiments with bodycams to find out whether this technology will become part of the standard equipment of all police officers. The experiments will be evaluated extensively.

Other organizations that use bodycams include local law enforcement agencies, such as the Amsterdam city wardens surveilling taxis. Body worn cameras are used city wardens in several cities, among which Alkmaar, Assen, Eindhoven and Rotterdam. Others that use body cameras are the stewards that supervise supporters during football matches or public events, such as festivals or protest-demonstrations. In other sectors such as public transportation, ambulances and fire-fighters, bodycams have been trialled, but have not been implemented on a large scale. Larger roll-outs are predicted from 2017 onwards.

Finland.
In Finland, a pilot with body cameras was started in 2015. Thirty cameras were used by the Helsinki Police Department to help the police in maintaining public order. It was hoped that body cameras might prevent crime and disorder. Furthermore, it was expected that the cameras could at the same time improve the way the police worked.
The cameras were meant to be used in specific settings and only in public places. Filming inside homes would only be allowed as part of a criminal investigation. The data were to be encrypted and could only be accessed with specific software, according to the police. It was expected that most recordings would be deleted right after each shift, because of the need for privacy protection.

United Arab Emirates.
Police in Dubai use <a href="Google%20Glass">Google Glass</a> to record incidents, including traffic offenses. Following a successful six month pilot scheme, the <a href="Dubai%20Police%20Force">Dubai Police Force</a> decided to adopt body worn video technology in 2015. Speaking to the media at the time, Gen Al Muzeina flagged-up the value of footage from these cameras. He said that this evidence could, potentially, be used where there are objections to traffic offences or a failure by officers to meet acceptable standards. The <a href="Abu%20Dhabi%20Police">Abu Dhabi Police</a> also confirmed in the same year that – following two years of trials – it would be rolling out body worn video cameras to patrol officers.

Effects.
Monitoring police behavior.
Police body cameras have been proven to be an effective way to monitor police behavior. A study concluded that when 46 randomly selected officers were chosen to wear video recording devices against 43 officers who were not, there was a 53% decrease in use-of-force incidents reported and civilian complaints dropped by nearly 65%.

Another indirect benefit police body worn cameras provide is the increased trust between the public and law enforcement. An example of heightened relationships occurred after the death of <a href="Shooting%20of%20Samuel%20DuBose">Sam DuBose</a> of <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> in 2015. Officer Ray Tensing claimed he had to fatally shoot Sam DuBose because “he was being dragged by the vehicle and had to fire his weapon.” However, after reviewing the body camera footage on Tensing’s person, it was discovered Tensing was lying and he was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter. After the discovery, DuBose’s sister said, “Every day now, I’m going to be marching for video cams.”

In another example, in 2014, a study was led by professors at <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a> and commanding officers in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a>. Among the other positive impacts that have been discovered, complaints against officers who wore body worn cameras dropped 23% compared to a 10% increase in officers who did not wear the camera.

Video as evidence or for reconstruction of events.
Video recording devices can also provide documented footage into the behavior of law enforcement officers, video can be used in the court of law and the cameras can encourage honesty and dispel any false accusations made by any parties. Although deemed as expensive, ranging between $400 and $1,200, body cameras can promote positive, civilized and appropriate behaviors.

Assaults against officers.
A study by researchers at Cambridge based on camera use on 2,122 officers across the United States and Britain (in total about 2.2 million work hours) was conducted in 2016. It concluded that assaults against police officers increased by about 15% while wearing cameras, but the data was insufficient to conclude exactly why.

Rialto and Mesa studies' results.
A <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> study found that there was a 59% reduction in use of force by officers in <a href="Rialto%2C%20California">Rialto, California</a>, after the police department began issuing body-worn cameras to officers, and that complaints fell by 87% compared to the previous year. Another study found that police officers assigned to wear body-worn cameras in <a href="Mesa%2C%20Arizona">Mesa, Arizona</a>, were less likely to stop-and-frisk or arrest people, but "were more likely to give citations and initiate encounters". The authors concluded that the officers are more proactive with the use of these cameras, but that they are not more likely to use invasive strategies "that may threaten the legitimacy of the organization".

Willingness to report crimes.
Body worn video can potentially have a legitimizing effect on public view of police officers, due to the perception that officers are more accountable for their actions if body cameras are recording these actions. According to research conducted by Cambridge University, more crimes were reported when officers wore body cameras than in control groups in which no cameras were worn.

Privacy concerns.
With 88% of Americans supporting body cameras on police officers, there is strong support for this technology. Implementation goals are to reduce the use of unnecessary force and increase accountability. However, with these cameras arise the issue of privacy. There are conditions concerning privacy for the public and police officers that are still being addressed. One is the fear that every police officer wearing this technology could become a "roving surveillance camera" and with facial recognition technology, this could become a huge impact on people's everyday lives, especially those with any slight resemblance to a wanted fugitive or terrorist. This can lead to not only an increase in police harassment cases but racial bias cases as well. There are also issues concerning party consent laws. In the context of recording, the biggest issues arise from whether consent from one or all parties is required before recording a conversation or interaction. Federal and individual states have varying statutes regarding consent laws. The nature of police work has officers interacting with citizens during their most vulnerable moments, such as citizens in the hospital, or domestic violence cases, there is also a threat of citizens not coming forward with tips for fear of being recorded. And in terms of the police officer's private contexts, they may forget to turn off cameras in the bathroom or in private conversations. These situations should be considered as the technology is developed further and the use of it is becoming more saturated. Departments will need to work with advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union to develop policies that balance citizen's Fourth Amendment rights with the public's desire for transparency.

Supply.
Costs and pricing.
Body cameras require sizeable investments. The prices of the cameras themselves are between $120 and 1,000, according to a market survey in 2012 by the United States Department of Justice in which seven suppliers were compared. A market survey in 2016, describing 66 body cameras of 38 different vendors, showed that the average price (or actually the average manufacturer’s suggested retail prices) was $570, with a minimum of $199 and a maximum of $2,000.

But the camera is just the start of the expenses. Police departments also have to run software and store data for all the cameras which can add up quickly. Other costs include maintenance, training and evaluations. In addition, several indirect costs will be incurred by bodycams, for instance, the hours police and others in the criminal justice system spend on managing, reviewing and using the recordings for prosecution. These 'hidden' costs are notoriously hard to quantify, but there is some evidence that shows that the amount of money spent on the body cameras themselves is only a minor portion of the total cost of ownership:

Manufacturers and suppliers.
In a 2012 market survey by the U.S. Department of Justice, eight companies producing body cameras were compared: <a href="Taser%20International">Taser International</a>, VieVu, StalkerVUE, Scorpion, FirstVU, Wolfcom, MuviView and <a href="Panasonic">Panasonic</a>. In 2014, the three top companies that had been producing body cameras throughout the United States were Taser International, VieVu, and Digital Ally. In 2016, a market survey described 66 body worn video cameras produced by 38 different vendors.

Victor Pantaleon Linares

Victor Pantaleon Linares (1807-1853), <a href="Californio">Californio</a>, soldier, ranchero, majordomo of <a href="Mission%20San%20Luis%20Obispo">Mission San Luis Obispo</a>, <a href="vecino">vecino</a> and <a href="judge">Juez</a> of <a href="San%20Luis%20Obispo">San Luis Obispo</a>. Grandson of some of the earliest Spanish settlers of California, his son <a href="Pio%20Linares">Pio Linares</a> was an infamous Californio leader of a <a href="bandit">bandit</a> gang in <a href="San%20Luis%20Obispo%20County">San Luis Obispo County</a> in the 1850's.

Victor Linares' Family and His Early Life.
Victor Pantaleon Linares was a descendant of his grandfather Ygnacio Antonio Linares, a <a href="Spanish%20people">Spanish</a> soldier from <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a> with a wife and four children that came to <a href="Alta%20California">Alta California</a> with the second <a href="Anza%20Expedition">Anza Expedition</a> in 1776. He served as a soldier in the <a href="Presidio%20of%20San%20Francisco">Presidio of San Francisco</a> and died in <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose</a> in 1805.

Victor Linares' father, Salvador Linares, son of Ygnacio Antonio Linares, was born on December 25, 1775 as the second Anza Expedition was crossing the desert from Sonora to <a href="Mission%20San%20Gabriel">Mission San Gabriel</a>. He followed his father as a soldier in the <a href="Presidio%20of%20Monterey%2C%20California">Monterey Presidio</a>, marrying a widow with a daughter, Maria Bernarda Alvarez. Together they had four sons, three that reached adulthood. However Salvador died at the Monterey Presidio in August 1807, at age 31, soon after the birth of his twin sons Francisco and Victor on July 24, 1807. Both were christened the next day at <a href="Mission%20Nuestra%20Senora%20de%20la%20Soledad">Mission Nuestra Senora de la Soledad</a>.

Salvador's widow with a daughter from her first marriage and the three young sons from the second, remarried for a third time on December 17, 1809 at Mission San Gabriel, to Jose Pedro Villalobos, a corporal of the garrison of <a href="San%20Diego%20Presidio">San Diego Presidio</a>. It was he or perhaps his father an old soldier and resident of San Diego, Juan Jose Miguel Villalobos, who raised the sons of Salvador Linares until his death March 7, 1825. That year the eldest Linares son, Jose Ynes de la Luz joined the garrison of San Diego Presidio followed the next year by the one of the younger twin sons, Victor Linares. The other twin son of Salvador, Francisco "Santiago" Linares, did not join the military but followed another path that led to his execution for a robbery and murder at <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> on April 7, 1841. He was buried in the <a href="La%20Iglesia%20de%20Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20la%20Reina%20de%20los%20%C3%81ngeles">La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles</a> Cemetery. 

At the San Diego Presidio Victor was married to a widow, Maria Micaela Villa, with two sons, Sebastian Villa, age 5 and Francisco age 2 on January 8, 1826. That April, while serving as a sentry, Victor Lenaris killed Juan German, a <a href="vecino">vecino</a> of San Diego. Linares was court-martialed but was acquitted because he had merely performed his duty as a sentry.

Within a year of the courtmartial Victor Linares had left San Diego and was living near Mission San Gabriel, where his first son Pedro was born on July 30, 1827 and christened the following day. Victor had become a vecino of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> by 1831, when his second son, <a href="Pio%20Linares">Pio</a> was born May 4 and the following day was christened in La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles in the town plaza. A census taken in Los Angeles in 1836 showed Victor living with his wife Micaela his two stepsons Sebastian Villa age 16 and Francisco Villa age 13, and his sons Pedro age 9, Pio age 5 and a third son Fernando age 1.

Ranchero.
The following year in 1837 Victor Linares was granted the two leagues of <a href="Rancho%20Tinaquaic">Rancho Tinaquaic</a> in what is now in <a href="Santa%20Barbara%20County%2C%20California">Santa Barbara County, California</a>. There three more of his children, two daughters Maria and Augustias and a son Raymundo were born, between 1838 and 1841. Located far from a church there are no surviving records known of birth or christening for these children, only later census data for their approximate age. In 1839, Victor Linares was appointed majordomo of the lands of the <a href="Mission%20San%20Luis%20Obispo%20de%20Tolosa">Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa</a> from May to October when he was let go to save the $20 salary and cost of his large family. 

However in on April 22, 1840, Victor Linares as an <a href="Alf%C3%A9rez%20%28rank%29">alférez</a> in the <a href="Monterey">Monterey</a> company of <a href="Militia">auxillaries</a>, was ordered by Governor <a href="Juan%20B.%20Alvarado">Juan B. Alvarado</a> to take charge of a Sargent and 11 men, under the command of Captain <a href="Rancho_San_Carlos_de_Jonata%23History">J. M. Covarrubias</a> to be an escort of Prefect <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Castro">Castro</a> during his mission to take 60 foreign prisoners including <a href="Isaac%20Graham">Isaac Graham</a>, to Mexico City. They were accused with of plotting the overthrow of the government of Alta California. However his detachment was later replaced by a larger number of men under more experienced leaders. 

About 1842, Rancho Tinaquaic came into the hands of <a href="Rancho_Tinaquaic%23History">William D. Foxen</a>, son in law of the grantee of the rancho adjacent to Tinaquaic and later the claimant for Tinaquaic before the Land Commission in 1852. The date of the disceno in the Rancho Tinaquaic Land Cass dates from 1842, the probable year Foxen acquired the grant of Rancho Tinaquaic from Victor Linares. That was the same year, Linares was granted <a href="Rancho%20Ca%C3%B1ada%20de%20los%20Osos">Rancho Cañada de los Osos</a> in <a href="San%20Luis%20Obispo%20County">San Luis Obispo County</a>, perhaps an exchange was made so Linares could have a rancho near his home in <a href="San%20Luis%20Obispo">San Luis Obispo</a> that he had also acquired.

In 1842 Victor Linares was granted a 1,000 <a href="Spanish_customary_units%23Vara_.28unit_of_length.29">vara</a> square lot (165.76 acres) within the Pueblo lands of San Luis Obispo by Gov. Juan B. Alvarado. It was later confirmed to his widow in 1857. 

Victor Linares was also granted the <a href="Rancho%20Ca%C3%B1ada%20de%20los%20Osos">Rancho Cañada de los Osos</a> on December 1, 1842 by Governor Juan B. Alvarado. The rancho lay west of <a href="San%20Luis%20Obispo">San Luis Obispo</a> to <a href="Morro%20Bay">Morro Bay</a> in the <a href="Los%20Osos%20Valley">Los Osos Valley</a>, between the <a href="Irish%20Hills%20%28California%29">Irish Hills</a> to the south and the <a href="Nine%20Sisters">Nine Sisters</a> to the north.

Vecino and Juez of San Luis Obispo.
In 1844, Victor Linares sold his rancho to James Scott and John Wilson who also bought the adjacent <a href="Rancho%20Pecho%20y%20Islay">Rancho Pecho y Islay</a> a strip of Pacific coastal terrace and the <a href="Irish%20Hills%20%28California%29">Irish Hills</a> bordering the terrace from <a href="Pecho%20Creek">Pecho Creek</a> to the east and <a href="Islay%20Creek">Islay Creek</a> to the north. Scott and Willson added it to their Los Osos rancho and combined them in a new 32,431 acre grant, <a href="Rancho%20Ca%C3%B1ada%20de%20los%20Osos%20y%20Pecho%20y%20Islay">Rancho Cañada de los Osos y Pecho y Islay</a> from Governor <a href="Pio%20Pico">Pio Pico</a> in 1845.

In January 1846 Victor Linares was appointed Juez of the Second Instance for San Luis Obispo. On March 7th, Linares ordered Padre Jose Nicolas Gomez, curate of the Mission San Luis, to turn over Mission property to Juez Jesus Pico for James Scott and John Wilson its purchasers. Padre Gomez appealed to the bishop, who asked the Governor to reserve certain storerooms and the mills of the Mission. The Governor promised to investigate. March 10th, Padre Gomez wrote to the Governor, complaining of lack of means of support, also of his mortifications and insults. March 29th, possession given to Jesus Pico. April 18th, Linares, Juez 2nd was reprimanded by the subprefect for insubordination.

The 1850 California census showed Victor Linares living in his home in the town, with his wife, sons Pedro 23, Pio 18, and Fernando 16, and daughters Maria Antonia, 14, Augustias, 12, Maria Olivia, 5, and Teresa, 3. The 1852 California census showed Victor Linares living in his home in the town, with his wife and younger children, [Fernando, 18, Raymundo, 9, Maria Olivia, 7. Pedro and Pio had been married and moved out. Pedro had been married to Maria Antonia Figueroa, in August 16, 1846, but only had his first child in May 1851. Pio had moved out after marrying a widow, Maria Antonia Ortega, May 17 1851.

On June 6, 1853, Victor Linares was buried at Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, having died of a fever.

It is home to 309 undergraduates.

History.
In 1926, the death of William Weir left the University with an estate of £77,500 to build its first hall of residence for male students. Although work began in 1930, the building had to be redesigned when the Napier earthquake struck in February 1931. On 1 March 1933, the governor-general planted a pohutukawa and officially opened Weir House. Sixty-five students took up residence that year in the original William Weir wing and by 1935, there was a waiting list.

In 1968, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20Trade%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Department of External Affairs</a> funded the James Hutchison Wing as part of the <a href="Colombo%20Plan">Colombo Plan</a>. This was later renovated and extended in 1994. After litigation due to the will of William Weir stating his money was to be used for a male hall of residence, female students were finally allowed to take up residence at Weir House in 1979 as the hall had built its extension through government funding. 

The former <a href="Government%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> ambassador's residence was acquired and converted to Andrea Brander House in 1987, accommodating students who wish to live in an alcohol free area. In 2006, a new alcohol-free block called Te Whānau was built and has a glass lounge (named Piringa), which is used as a common area.

Controversies.
In 2017, <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a> proposed that the position of Head of Hall across its six halls be cut, and replaced by three Hall General Managers. The cited reason was due to a survey in which students were claimed to have stated pastoral care was not important.

<doc id="54920223" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54920223" title="Desert Strike (EP)">
Desert Strike (EP)

Desert Strike is the third <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> of <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> musician <a href="Fatima%20Al%20Qadiri">Fatima Al Qadiri</a>. The record is based on "" (1992), a video game that in turn is based on events of <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> of the Gulf War. As a kid who lived in Kuwait during the Gulf War, Qadiri played the game a year after it took place, which messed with how she remembered experiencing the actual war. Given how dark the game portrayed the Gulf War, she intended the extended play to represent a positive and "innocent" view of it by pairing a palette of child-like sounds with war sound effects. Released on 23 October 2012 by the label Fade To Mind, "Desert Strike" garnered generally favorable reviews from professional <a href="music%20journalist">music journalist</a>s and landed on "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" magazine's list of the "Best Dance Albums of 2012." 

Concept.
Fade to Mind's press release for "Desert Strike" described the extended play as "the synthesis of terror and child-like wonder, to the strategies of imagination and gaming." The EP is based on "" (1992), a video game for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> which in turn is based on events of <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> of the Gulf War. She played it a year after she experienced the war personally while living in <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. Playing the game messed with her memories of what she really experienced during the war. Qadiri explained, “it really messed me up in the head, because I was just like ‘how does this exist in a format that I can play?’ I couldn’t even describe how disturbing the feeling was.” 

As a kid, in order to "take hold" of how Qadiri remembered the war, she used a <a href="Casio">Casio</a> keyboard to perform melodies that made fictional worlds and "war games" for her and her sister to be involved in. Similarly when she was an adult, given the dark way the game viewed the war, Qadiri wanted the EP to present a more positive, "deep," and "innocent" perspective of the event. As "Dummy" explained, ""Desert Strike" as a game gave the children the sickening power of being able to see their situation from another, jarring perspective, and so ‘Desert Strike’ as an EP tries to make that active participation something that is actually positive and empowering, rather than a sinister role reversal or trivialisation of a tragedy." Some journalists and Qadiri herself have categorized "Desert Strike" as a major part of a phenomenon coined by writer <a href="Sophia%20Al%20Maria">Sophia Al Maria</a> as "<a href="Sophia%20Al%20Maria%23Gulf%20Futurism">Gulf Futurism</a>."

Composition.
While technically based on the video game of the same name, "Desert Strike" is completely devoid of what Qadiri described as the "ugly" and "unsettling" tone of the game's soundtrack. Instead, it consists of bright, child-like sounds alongside otherwise serious war sound effects. "Dummy" described the record as having "a rough-around-the-edges aesthetic that naively, almost playfully, runs rings around the themes of conflict and aggression." "Desert Strike" follows what writer Rory Gibb described as a "disembodied dance" structure that uses styles of <a href="grime%20music">grime music</a>, <a href="Footwork%20%28genre%29">footwork</a>, and <a href="G-funk">G-funk</a>. 

Similar to Qadiri's previous records, "Desert Strike" has a sound palette primarily consisting of 1980s and 1990s-style digital keyboard replications of instruments such as choirs, horns, steel drums, organs, gunshots and explosions. These are played alongside 8-bit <a href="video%20game">video game</a> textures over what the press release labeled as "sparse, decisive percussion." Jackson analyzed the choir sounds "give the EP a somewhat uneasy feel, serving as either the source of a particular song's eeriness or alternately providing a touch of angelic air to the procession, depending on what they are paired along with." Differences from Qadiri's past records include slower <a href="tempo">tempo</a>s and "more spacious" structures, wrote Glenn Jackson of "<a href="XLR8R">XLR8R</a>".

Release and promotion.
"Ghost Raid" was released on 11 October 2012, and its video, produced by Alex Gvojic of the company Thunderhorse for <a href="MOCA%20LA">MOCA LA</a>, was revealed on 1 February 2013. "<a href="The%20Fader">The Fader</a>" summarized, "Collapsing real life war footage into vintage video game animations and original CGI wizardry, Alex Gvojic depicts an imaginary weapon of mass destruction called the "Ghost," supernaturally animated by djinn, a spirit in Islamic mythology believed to influence the minds and hearts of men by incarnating itself in various living forms." In an interview with "<a href="Rhizome%20%28organization%29">Rhizome</a>", Qadiri stated she was working with Al-Maria on a music video for the EP's title track. However, a music video for the song has not been released. Fade to Mind released "Desert Strike" in digital stores and on vinyl on 23 October 2012.

Critical reception.
Numerous journalists, including Carey Waggoner and Gibb, compared sound the quality of "Desert Strike" to Qadiri's previous release "Genre Specific Xperience" (2011). Reviewing for "<a href="Noisey">Noisey</a>", Waggoner graded the the EP a B+, calling it "extraordinary" but feeling that it wasn't as musically varied or "opulent" as "Genre Specific Xperience". As Gibb opined, "Most tracks here are strong enough to exist by themselves, but lacking the drive of "Genre-Specific Xperience", at times they feel frustratingly fragile, beautiful and absorbing miniatures that could be scattered to the wind within a fraction of a second." Allison Stewart of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" called the EP a "chilly and fascinating work," describing it as a "deceptively mild offering that shouldn’t work — its songs are virtually indistinguishable from each other, it’s impossible to separate its inherent worth from Al Qadiri’s backstory, the Enya-esque backing vocals often make it seem like apocalyptic spa music — but it does, somehow." "Desert Strike" was placed on "Spin" magazine's list of the "20 Best Dance Albums of 2012," where the publication called it the year's most "socially relevant" electronic record.

All applicants must meet eligibility criteria, which requires them to be residents of foreign countries, working for foreign information outlets headquartered in their respective countries. 

The I-1 visa does not grant anyone guaranteed entry to the United States. It initially gives the holder permission to travel to the United States port-of-entry for an interview with a representative of the <a href="United%20States%20Citizenship%20and%20Immigration%20Services">United States Citizenship and Immigration Services</a>, who decides whether or not the holder should be given the right to cross the border and work in the United States. 

Applicants for the I-1 visa must be able to prove that their activities in the United States. are of great value to the employing organization. These activities must not have any commercial motive, such as entertainment or advertising, while the organization itself must represent press, radio, film, print or other types of information media. Any activity that does not rely on the process of gathering information and reporting on actual events that take place within the territory of the United States cannot be considered grounds for obtaining the I-1 visa. 

Every foreign media representative who is willing to visit the United States to engage in the media profession must apply for the I visa. <a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">American immigration law</a> does not allow holders of other visa types or those visiting the United States under any other status or programs, such as the <a href="Visa%20Waiver%20Program">Visa Waiver Program</a>., to work for foreign media outlets without the I visa. The only exception is representatives working for the <a href="United%20Nations%20Organization">United Nations Organization</a>.

Spouses and children of the I visa holder can legally travel to the United States with him or her after obtaining the same type of visa (derivative visa). Immediate family members are allowed to study, but they are not allowed to take any job while staying in the United States.


Duration of status.
The I visa is usually issued for one year. Upon arrival to the US port-of-entry, every I visa holder is provided with <a href="Form%20I-94">Form I-94</a> and a stamp that determines a time frame of his or her authorized stay in the country. I visa holders are not required to leave or re-enter the country during their stay, but must leave the United States on or before the date their permission document expires. 

Visa extension.
The I visa holder has a right to extend his or her stay in the United States for an unlimited amount of time by filing an Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status (<a href="Form%20I-539">Form I-539</a>) and providing the necessary documentation and fees. The procedure of extension does not require the holder of a media visa to leave the country, whereas a visa revalidation can only be processed outside the United States. 

Exceptions.
The following categories of foreign media representatives can visit the United States without applying for the media visa:


The following activities are not considered grounds for obtaining the I visa:

The station would serve the <a href="Portway%20park%20and%20ride">Portway park and ride</a> facility on the <a href="Portway%2C%20Bristol">A4 Portway</a> and form part of the <a href="MetroWest%20%28Bristol%29">MetroWest</a> scheme.

History.
The railway through the site was inaugurated on 6 March 1865 when services began on the <a href="Bristol%20Port%20Railway%20and%20Pier">Bristol Port Railway and Pier</a> (BPRP), a self-contained railway which ran along the north bank of the <a href="River%20Avon%20%28Bristol%29">River Avon</a> to a deep water pier on the <a href="Severn%20Estuary">Severn Estuary</a> at <a href="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a>. The route was standard gauge single track. The BPRP ran into trouble by 1871 when the terminal pier at Avonmouth became difficult to use due to a build-up of <a href="silt">silt</a>. With no prospect of a proper dock being funded without a connection to the national rail network, the <a href="Clifton%20Extension%20Railway">Clifton Extension Railway</a> (CER) was approved. This was a joint venture by the BPRP, <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> and <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a> which ran from Sneyd Park Junction, south of , via , to join up with the national network at <a href="Narroways%20Hill%20Junction">Narroways Hill Junction</a>. The link opened in 1877. Despite the increased traffic the BPRP suffered financially, and was taken over by the CER in 1890. When the railways were nationalised in <a href="Transport%20Act%201947">1948</a>, the line came under the aegis of the <a href="Western%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">Western Region of British Railways</a> and, upon <a href="Privatisation%20of%20British%20Rail">privatisation</a>, transferred to <a href="Railtrack">Railtrack</a> and later <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a>. A <a href="Portway%20park%20and%20ride">park and ride</a> was opened near junction 18 of the <a href="M5%20motorway">M5 motorway</a>, adjacent to the railway, in 2002. 

In 2009 it was proposed that a railway station should be built. The plan was supported by <a href="Friends%20of%20Suburban%20Bristol%20Railways">Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways</a> and the Bristol branch of the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Rail%2C%20Maritime%20and%20Transport%20Workers">National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers</a>. The plan was approved in October 2012. In 2017, £2.23 million was allocated for construction, of which £1.67m came from the government's New Stations Fund, with additional funding coming from the <a href="West%20of%20England%20Combined%20Authority">West of England Combined Authority</a> and <a href="West%20of%20England%20Local%20Enterprise%20Partnership">West of England Local Enterprise Partnership</a>.

Pork.
With respect to the animal, the part where the koteletts are taken from reach from the front to the hind leg.

The middle ones are known as "Stielkotelett" or "Rippenkotelett" (lit. rib kotelett) due to the long and closely fitting rib cage.

Mutton.
Similarly to the veal, koteletts from mutton are taken from the front or middle part of the ribs only.

Beef.
The front kotelett of the beef is known as "Hochrippe" (lit. high ribs) and is usually used as boiled beef, <a href="goulash">goulash</a> or, without the bones, as <a href="steak">steak</a>. The hind kotelett or the beef is known in two variants: with ribs and without. Together with the fillet, it is similar to the <a href="t-bone%20steak">t-bone steak</a>.

Fish.

<doc id="54920507" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54920507" title="Victoria House">
Victoria House

Victoria House is the oldest of the <a href="residential%20college">residential college</a>s of <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a> located in the city of <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. It is home to 182 undergraduates. Opened in 1907 as the Women Student's Hostel Society, Victoria House is the longest established hall of residence at Victoria University of Wellington, and the second hall of residence for women students in New Zealand.

History.
In the early years of the twentieth century Margaret Wallis (the wife of the Bishop Frederic Wallis, Anglican Bishop of Wellington), Jean Gibb (wife of Rev Dr James Gibb, minister of St John's Presbyterian Church) and a group of other like-minded women recognised the need for a hostel for women who had come to Wellington to undertake study at <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a> and the Wellington Teacher's Training College. This group of women formed the Women Student's Hostel Society, and the outcome of their initial efforts was a two-storied wooden building at 282 the Terrace, which accommodated 29 residents. A kitchen, dining and sitting room, and accommodation for the matron - the person who ran the hostel - were included.

Opened in 1907, this building is still part of Victoria House. Almost immediately the building was finished, the Society purchased the cottage next door (280 The Terrace), using it for additional accommodation. This was the first of many acquisitions of adjacent or nearby properties over the next century. In the mid-1950s, the original building was extensively refurbished and extended over the site of the adjacent cottage, providing a few additional rooms, and improved kitchen facilities, dining room and common room.

Then in the early 1970s, a five-storeyed accommodation block – later called Wallis Wing – was built across the back of all the old houses the Society had acquired from 280 to 288 The Terrace. As before, the opportunity was taken to build a new kitchen and dining room to accommodate the greatly increased numbers of residents, and as a consequence the original hostel building was refurbished once again.

Some of the old houses along The Terrace were subsequently removed to enable construction of the modern buildings now known as Pope House (opened in 1993), and the Bennett Houses. Most recently, 9 Maurice Terrace (behind Wallis Wing) was reconstructed as Hutchison House (2013). In 2014 seismic strengthening was undertaken of Wallis Wing and a progressive refurbishment programme for the building was started, the first stage of which was completed in early 2015.

<doc id="54920722" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54920722" title="Chawmos">
Chawmos

Chawmos (cawmōs, ghona chawmos yat, Khowar "chitrimas" from *cāturmāsya, CDIAL 4742) is the most important Kalash festival, which is celebrated for two weeks at winter solstice (Dec. 7-22), at the beginning of the month chawmos mastruk in two weeks.<br>

The Chamois festival is celebrated without using any musical instruments in the Rumbur and Bumborate villages, whereas residents of Birir village do use the musical instruments. Chamois festival is celebrated after the Kalash finish all their fieldwork and store all the sources of their basic needs. By this time of the year cheese, fruit and vegetables and grains are properly stored.<br>

The 1st Week of the Festival (7 to 22 Dec) is a private festival of Kalash People and they don’t allow outsiders to view it, the Kalash Girls select their Bridegroom after some rituals. The entire population remains indoor. It is celebrated by feasting and merry making until the elders, who sit on a hill top, watching the sun reaching the orbit, declare the advent of the New Year. Children go up to the mountain, where they divide into boys and girls, and respectively make a big bonfire.
<br>
Then it comes 2nd week (15 to 22-Dec) in which they thank their God by dance and music. This part of festival is public and they celebrate it at different location one by one and tourist are allowed to view them. It marks the end of the year's fieldwork and harvest. It involves much music, dancing, and the sacrifice of many goats. It is dedicated to the god Balimain who is believed to visit from the mythical homeland of the Kalash, Tsyam (Tsiyam, tsíam), for the duration of the feast. Food sacrifices are offered at the clans' Jeshtak shrines, dedicated to the ancestors.<br>

At Chaumos, impure and uninitiated persons are not admitted; they must be purified by a waving a fire brand over women and children and by a special fire ritual for men, involving a shaman waving juniper brands over the men. The 'old rules' of the gods (Devalog, dewalōk) are no longer in force, as is typical for year-end and carnival-like rituals. The main Chaumos ritual takes place at a Tok tree, a place called Indra's place, "indrunkot", or "indréyin". Indrunkot is sometimes believed to belong to Balumain's brother, In(dr), lord of cattle. Ancestors, impersonated by young boys (ōnjeṣṭa 'pure') are worshipped and offered bread; they hold on to each other and form a chain (cf. the Vedic anvārambhaṇa) and snake through the village.<br>

The men must be divided into two parties: the pure ones have to sing the well-honored songs of the past, but the impure sing wild, passionate, and obscene songs, with an altogether different rhythm. This is accompanied by a 'sex change': men dress as women, women as men (Balumain also is partly seen as female and can change between both forms at will).
The festival is celebrated to welcome the arrival of the New Year. All the Kalash people remain indoors and outsiders are not allowed to enter their settlements for 7 days. The people have a merry time by free wine drinking and they sacrifice goats. People show their thanks by dancing and singing together, enjoying every moment. During the festivals prayers, a procession is made to a high plateau outside the village in Balangkuru where the long night of dancing begins. The festivals continue for many more days moving on to different locations within the valleys. It is the most exciting among all the festivals. Girls dance in cold weather and snowfall and boys play various winter games in the festival. Tourist rarely visit the festival due to blockage of roads and heavy snowfall.

Since 1772 he was a chief architect of duke <a href="Peter%20von%20Biron">Peter von Biron</a>. Since 1795 chief architect of the <a href="Courland%20Governorate">Courland Governorate</a>.

Biography.
Severin Sören Jensen was born in 1723 in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Denmark">Kingdom of Denmark</a>. There is no reliable sources about his early life or education.
In 1766 Jensen arrived in Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and was hired as an assistant of architect <a href="Bartolomeo%20Rastrelli">Bartolomeo Rastrelli</a>. He was a foreman (Kondukteur) and supervised construction of <a href="Rund%C4%81le%20Palace">Rundāle</a> and <a href="Jelgava%20Palace">Jelgava Palace</a>s. Gates and stable complex of Rundāle palace however was built after Jensens own project in 1766-67. Also he supervised construction of <a href="Za%C4%BCenieki%20Manor">Zaļenieki Manor</a> (1769 - 1774).

In 1772 last <a href="duke%20of%20Courland">duke of Courland</a> Peter von Biron promoted Jensen to chief architect of the duchy (Hofarchitekt). Already in 1770 dukes hunting lodge in Pienava was built after Jensens design. In 1780 it got the name "Friedrichlust" in honour of crown prince of Prussia <a href="Frederick%20William%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William II of Prussia</a>. From 1775 until 1785 dukes favorite <a href="Vircava%20Manor">Vircava Manor</a> was built after Jensens design.
In 1773 - 1775 Jensen reconstructed and expanded <a href="Sv%C4%93te%20Palace">Svēte palace</a> near Jelgava. In 1774 - 75 building of "<a href="Academia%20Petrina">Academia Petrina</a>" in <a href="Jelgava">Jelgava</a> was built after Jensens design.
After Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was incorporated into <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> in 1795 Severin Jensen became chief architect of the newly established Courland Governorate.

In 1803 Jensen left Courland and traveled to <a href="Italy">Italy</a> where he participated in the building of <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Caserta">Royal Palace of Caserta</a>.

Just like his early years also his last years is badly documented. Most sources claims that Severin Jensen died after 1809 in Jelgava.
He worked in the style of <a href="Classicism">Classicism</a> which was very popular in Peter von Biron court. In his early works (Stables of Rundāle palace, Zaļenieki manor) interesting symbiosis of <a href="baroque">baroque</a> and classicism can been seen.

Kate Brousseau

Kate Brousseau (April 24, 1862 - July 8, 1938) was an American professor and researcher on mental hygiene, chair of the Psychology Department at Mills College.

Early life.
Kate Brousseau was born on April 24, 1862 in <a href="Ypsilanti%2C%20Michigan">Ypsilanti, Michigan</a>, daughter of Judge Julius Brousseau (1834-1903), born in New York by French Canadian parents, and Caroline Yakeley (1834-1901), of English and German heritage. Brousseau was the older of 4 siblings, the others being: Mabel (1871-1941, a respected music teacher and held Wednesday afternoon Studio teas at her home, 233 Thorn street, Garvanza), Edward P. (1874-1925) and Roy Alfred (1876-1936).
Brousseau was educated at <a href="Los%20Angeles%20High%20School">Los Angeles High School</a> and Los Angeles State <a href="Normal%20school">Normal school</a> (later <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a>). She was valedictorian of her class, the first graduating from Los Angeles State Normal School in 1884. She then studied at <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>, <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Chicago%20Law%20School">University of Chicago Law School</a>, in Germany and in Paris. In Paris she was the only woman in a class of 60 students. She was granted a doctorate with high honors, Ph.D., from the <a href="Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a>, Paris, in 1904.

Career.
Around 1882 Kate Brousseau started her teaching career giving private French lessons at her family home, the Brousseau Mansion, built around 1878 by her father, at 238 South Bunker Hill Avenue, Los Angeles. The house was demolished in 1967.

In 1891 Brosseau taught French at the Los Angeles State Normal School and also translated French literature for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>". From 1897 to 1903 Brousseau was on the faculty at the Los Angeles State Normal School teaching mathematics and psychology. From 1907 to 1928 she was professor of psychology and in the end chair of the Psychology Department at <a href="Mills%20College">Mills College</a>, Oakland.

Brousseau made a psychological survey of the inmates of "Sonoma State Home for the Feebleminded" (later <a href="Sonoma%20Developmental%20Center">Sonoma Developmental Center</a>) in 1914 and 1915, giving tests to about 1400 disabled children and was director of the psychological services at the Institute of Family Relations in Los Angeles.

Brousseau served in the <a href="French%20Army%20in%20World%20War%20I">French Army in World War I</a> from 1917 to 1919, as "directrice des Foyers du Soldat" (director of a soldiers' home), stationed on Lorraine Front; she was with the French Army of Occupation in Germany and in devastated districts of Northern France.

At the end of the war Brosseau helped to rehabilitate traumatized soldiers and was assistant to surgeon Dr. E. Toulouse in examining French women working "traditionally masculine works" as factory workers or street railway employees.

Brousseau was awarded the Medaille Commemorative Francaise de la Grand Guerre by the French Government in 1920.

Brousseau is the author of "L'éducation des nègres aux États-Unis" (1904) and "Mongolism: A Study of the Physical and Mental Characteristics of Mongolian Imbeciles" (1928). In "Mongolism" Brousseau argues that a precursor of the Down Syndrome was to be found in the "furfuraceous cretin" described by <a href="%C3%89douard%20S%C3%A9guin">Édouard Séguin</a> in "Idiocy and its Treatment by the Physiological Method" (1866). The term Mongolism was replaced by a more scientific term only later, in 1961, after <a href="Clemens%20Ernst%20Benda">Clemens Ernst Benda</a> signed a petition on the "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" journal.

Brousseau was treasurer and director of the Southern California Society of Mental Hygiene.

<doc id="54920965" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54920965" title="Propair Flight 420">
Propair Flight 420

Propair Flight 420 (PRO420) was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from <a href="Dorval">Dorval</a>, Quebec to <a href="Peterborough">Peterborough</a>, Ontario. The flight was carried out by <a href="Propair">Propair</a>, a <a href="charter%20airline">charter airline</a> based in <a href="Rouyn-Noranda%2C%20Quebec">Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec</a>, using a <a href="Fairchild%20Swearingen%20Metroliner">Fairchild Metroliner SSA26</a>. On 18 June 1998, the aircraft suffered an in-flight fire shortly after take-off from Dorval and the crew elected to conduct an <a href="emergency%20landing">emergency landing</a>. The intense heat of the fire caused a <a href="structural%20failure">structural failure</a> in the left wing and the aircraft crashed, killing all 11 passengers and crew on board.

The investigation conducted by the Canadian <a href="Transportation%20Safety%20Board">Transportation Safety Board</a> revealed that the left brakes of Flight 420 had overheated during take-off, causing a fire inside the wheel-well which destroyed warning systems, causing the crew to be unaware of the severity of the fire, then ruptured hydraulic pipe-lines and spreading to the left wing.

Following the accident the Canadian <a href="Transportation%20Safety%20Board">TSB</a> issued several recommendations, one of which was a recommendation to the <a href="FAA">FAA</a> regarding the crew training and flight manual, and another being a recommendation to install an overheat warning system inside the wheel-wells of every Metroliner; before the accident warning systems were not required on such aircraft.

Flight.
Propair Flight 420 took off from <a href="Dorval%20Airport">Dorval Airport</a> (now Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport) at 07:01 EDT carrying 9 passengers and 2 crew members. The flight was chartered by General Electric to transport personnel to a GE facility in Peterborough, Ontario. It was foggy at the time with light winds blowing from the right side of the aircraft. Flight 420 was cleared to 16,000 ft.

At 07:13, the crew of Flight 420 informed the tower that there was a decrease on the hydraulic pressure and requested to return to the airport. Dorval Tower cleared Flight 420's request to return and ordered them to descend to and make a 180 degree turn. At the time there was no indication that the flight was in grave danger.

Approximately 30 seconds after Flight 420's request to return, control problems started to occur. The aircraft became harder to control and a warning indicator showed that an engine problem was developing. 40 seconds later, the wing overheat warning system was illuminated. Before the crew had conducted the checklist for handling such an emergency, the warning light went off. 5 minutes later the left engine appeared to be on fire. The crew later shut down the engine.

The aircraft could barely be controlled by the crew; an abnormal right aileron input was needed to keep the aircraft on heading. Dorval Tower then suggested that the crew divert to <a href="Montr%C3%A9al%E2%80%93Mirabel%20International%20Airport">Montréal–Mirabel International Airport</a>. The crew agreed. The fire intensified and the crew could see that fire was coming out from the engine nacelle. The crew then conducted emergency checklist and configured the aircraft for landing.

At 07:23, the crew stated that the fire in the left wing had died out. However, less than four minutes later, they announced that the fire had started again. The aircraft became harder to control and even started to roll. Maximum aileron trim were set by the crew. While Flight 420 was short on final, the landing gear was deployed.

When Flight 420 was near the runway threshold, the severely damaged left wing failed. The aircraft then rotated 90 degrees to the left: fuel spilled from the aircraft and ignited. The aircraft spiralled and crashed, coming to rest on the left side of Runway 24L. All 2 crew members and 9 passengers on board were killed. 2 passengers initially survived the crash, but ultimately died of their injuries.

Passengers and crews.
The flight was chartered by <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> to transport their workers to their facility in <a href="Lachine%2C%20Quebec">Lachine, Quebec</a> and <a href="Peterborough">Peterborough</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. Flight 420 was carrying 9 passengers (initially reported 10). All of them were engineers, working as a team in the design of hydroelectric turbines. All of them were regular commuters.

Speaking on a press conference, Company President of Propair, Jean Pronovost, claimed that both pilots were "very professional".

The pilot of the flight was identified as 35 year old Captain Jean Provencher. He began his pilot career as a first officer on the type in November 1996 to May 1996. He served as captain and as check pilot on similar aircraft types for several air carriers. In May 1996, he was hired
by Propair as company chief pilot. He had accumulated a total flying hours of 6,515 hours, of which 4,200 of them were on the type.

The co-pilot was identified as 35 year old Walter Stricker. Stricker began his pilot career in June 1995. In March 1998, he was hired as a first officer by Propair. He earned his first officer endorsement on May 9 and started his training and line check phase on May 13. He had accumulated a total flying hours of 2,730 hours, of which 93 of them were on the type.

Investigation.
Minutes before the crash, the crew of Flight 420 reported that there was a fire on board the aircraft. Inspection on Flight 420's wreckage confirmed that fire indeed had occurred in mid-flight. Constable Gilles Deziel, who had toured the crash site, stated that "three quarters of the plane was all burned and all black". Investigators then investigated the ignition source of the fire and conducted several tests.

Experiments on the equipments.
Investigators found out that when pressures were added to the brakes, then there would be an increase in drag force and temperature on the assembly. Examination on the brake assembly of Flight 420 revealed that at the time, the brake assembly's temperature were exposed to a temperature of more than 600 degree Celsius, which may indicated that there was a significant amount of drag force at the time of the crash.

Another test was conducted by investigators. This time, they conducted the test to know if hydraulic fluids of Flight 420 would ignite when it contacted the hot surface of the brake assembly. Investigators used two kinds of hydraulic fluids; the contaminated and uncontaminated one. The result was that an intense fire broke out after it contacted with the hot surface. The test also revealed that the contaminated hydraulic fluids have lower ignition point than the uncontaminated one.

Sequence of events.
Investigators noticed that during Flight 420's take off roll, the aircraft was pulled to the left and the crew had to apply right rudder input in order to correct the path of the aircraft. The aircraft also had to take off in much longer time than usual. These indications were consistent with presence of drag force on the left brakes. Examination on the left brakes confirmed this. It revealed that the brakes had been dragged.

The crew did not not notice that the left brakes had been dragged during its take off roll and had overheated. The overheated brakes were retracted by the crew and entered the wheel wells. The wheel wells subsequently closed to secure the wheels. The wheel wells did not have sufficient cooling, and so the temperature of the brakes continued to rise, reaching as high as 600 degree Celsius.

The overheated brakes and wheels then spread the heat to the tires and the surrounding structures. Tests conducted by investigators revealed that when tire fragments came into contacted with overheated brakes they ignited. The tire was exposed to a temperature of 600 Celsius, igniting a fire. The situation was worsened when a Nitrile piston leaked its flammable fluid. The Nitrile Piston would start to degrade when it contacted a surface temperature of 135 degree Celsius. The flammable liquid contacted the fire, causing an intense flame.

A brake overheat warning system should have warned the crew. However, a brake overheat warning system was not required on the type of the aircraft, so the crew of Flight 420 did not know that a fire had developed. Since hydraulic lines were located near the wheel wells, the fire ruptured the aircraft's hydraulic line, which caused the fire to intensify.

An orange warning light then went on to warn the crew that an overheating had occurred on the left wing (as the fire had spread through the left wing). Before the crew initiated the checklist to handle the emergency, the warning light suddenly went off. They thought that the warning had ended. However, this was wrong. The ceasing of the warning was caused by the fire in the wheel wells; the fire had destroyed the warning system's electrical circuit.

The crew never realized the severity of the fire. The fire was already too severe and started to degrade the structural integrity of the lift wing. This caused the crew to hardly be able to control the aircraft. The crew had to apply maximum aileron trim setting due to the reduction of the stiffness of the wing. The left wing then failed upwards, causing the aircraft to roll through 90 degree and crash, subsequently bursting into flames and killing everyone on board.

Neither their first single "No Music On My Radio" (sung by Preston), nor later single "Permanent Hire" (sung by Lyon) equalled the success of "Doctor I Like Your Medicine." Their self-titled album, released in 1981, reached 14 in the national charts. 

Preston left the band in 1981. The band reformed with a new lineup in 1982, but soon afterwards broke up permanently. 

Lyon joined fellow ex-Hello Sailor member <a href="Graham%20Brazier">Graham Brazier</a>'s band The Leigonnaires, which eventually led to a full Hello Sailor reunion. Paul Dunningham joined Mi-Sex. Preston went on to have a lengthy solo career as a boogie-woogie pianist and singer.

Cindy Arlette Contreras Bautista (born ) is a <a href="Peru">Peruvian</a> lawyer and advocate for women. She is an <a href="International%20Women%20of%20Courage%20Award">International Women of Courage Award</a> recipient after a protest (<a href="NiUnaMenos%20%28Peru%29">NiUnaMenos (Peru)</a>) was made in Peru. The protest was at the lax punishment given to a man who assaulted Bautista by pulling her around by her hair. She was also included in the TIME 100 list of the most influential people.

Life.
Bautista was born in the Peruvian city of <a href="Ayacucho">Ayacucho</a>. She came to notice after she was assaulted at a hotel by her boyfriend. Security cameras recorded her being battered and pulled screaming along by her hair. The evidence was sufficient to convict her assailant but a three judge panel decided that he should be given a suspended sentence in July 2016.

She was so annoyed that she took to the media and the press with the video evidence. Her treatment became a rallying point for the <a href="NiUnaMenos%20%28Peru%29">NiUnaMenos</a> demonstration. This was said to be the largest demonstration ever in Peru.

In 2017 her peaceful advocacy was recognised by the US State department who chose her with twelve others to receive an <a href="International%20Women%20of%20Courage%20Award">International Women of Courage Award</a> each in Washington. She was also chosen as an "Icon" by <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a> magazine for their list of the 100 most Influential People.

Philadelphia City Council special election, 1962

Philadelphia's City Council special election of 1962 was held to fill three vacant city council seats. The first was in the 8th district, when <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="Alfred%20Leopold%20Luongo">Alfred Leopold Luongo</a> was appointed to the federal bench in September 1961. A second vacancy that same year occurred in the 10th district when Democrat <a href="John%20M.%20McDevitt">John M. McDevitt</a> resigned in June 1962 to become a Catholic priest. An at-large seat also became vacant when <a href="Victor%20E.%20Moore">Victor E. Moore</a> resigned in September 1962 to become the head of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Gas%20Works">Philadelphia Gas Works</a>. Special elections were scheduled for November 6, 1962, to be held at the same time as <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Pennsylvania%2C%201962">the federal</a> and <a href="Pennsylvania%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201962">gubernatorial elections</a> that year. Democrats held two of the seats but lost the 8th district to a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>.

Background.
<a href="Alfred%20Leopold%20Luongo">Alfred Leopold Luongo</a> was a lawyer who had represented the 8th district in the northwest section of the city since <a href="Philadelphia%20municipal%20election%2C%201959">1959</a>. The district was among the city's most marginal, electing a Democrat in <a href="Philadelphia%20municipal%20election%2C%201951">1951</a> and a Republican in <a href="Philadelphia%20municipal%20election%2C%201955">1955</a>, both times by narrow margins. On September 14, 1961, President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> nominated Luongo to a new seat on the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Pennsylvania">United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania</a> and he was confirmed by the Senate later that month.

In June 1962, <a href="John%20M.%20McDevitt">John M. McDevitt</a> resigned his seat to enter a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="seminary">seminary</a>. Towey had represented the 10th district, which covered much of <a href="Northeast%20Philadelphia">Northeast Philadelphia</a>, since 1955. He had won convincingly in his most recent election, carrying 58% of the vote over his <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> opponent.

In September of that year, at-large councilman <a href="Victor%20E.%20Moore">Victor E. Moore</a> resigned his seat to become head of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Gas%20Works">Philadelphia Gas Works</a>. The at-large seat he held was safely Democratic, as that party's candidates had won the maximum possible at-large seats in each election since the seats were created in 1951. Moore had been first or second in votes in each of those three elections, including his most recent victory in 1959.

Philadelphia officials had anticipated another special election that years, as well, when Mayor <a href="Richardson%20Dilworth">Richardson Dilworth</a> resigned to run for <a href="Governor%20of%20Pennsylvania">Governor of Pennsylvania</a>. According to the city charter, the President of City Council, <a href="James%20H.%20J.%20Tate">James H. J. Tate</a> would serve as acting mayor until a new one was elected at the next general election; however, the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Supreme%20Court">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> ruled that the charter violated state law in calling for a municipal election in an even-numbered year. That decision required Tate to serve for another year as acting mayor, which led to another lawsuit demanding that he vacate his 7th district council seat and call a special election. That case also went to the state Supreme Court, which held that no such vacancy existed under the charter's rules and that Tate could continue to take a leave of absence without legally vacating his seat.

Candidate selection.
Instead of a primary, the nominees were selected by the <a href="Ward%20%28political%20district%29">ward</a> leaders of the wards that made up the councilmanic districts. In the 8th, Republican ward leaders selected <a href="Stanley%20B.%20Smullen">Stanley B. Smullen</a>, a real estate agent who also served as the Republican leader of the 59th ward. Democratic leaders nominated <a href="John%20A.%20Geisz">John A. Geisz</a>, the head of the inheritance tax bureau of the state board of revenue. In the 10th district, Republicans nominated <a href="Joseph%20Leo%20McGlynn%2C%20Jr.">Joseph Leo McGlynn, Jr.</a>, an attorney. Democrats settled on <a href="Robert%20B.%20Winkelman">Robert B. Winkelman</a>, an insurance broker.

For the at-large seat, ward leaders from across the city took part in the selection process. The Republicans selected <a href="James%20T.%20McDermott%20%28judge%29">James T. McDermott</a>, a local lawyer who had previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney. Democrats decided on <a href="Walter%20S.%20Pytko">Walter S. Pytko</a>, the executive director of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Parking%20Authority">Philadelphia Parking Authority</a> and a former state senator and ward leader. Pytko's nomination came as a surprise to many observers of the political scene, and his nomination was believed to be the choice of <a href="William%20J.%20Green%2C%20Jr.">William J. Green, Jr.</a>, the Democratic organization's chairman.

Result.
At the at-large race, Pytko easily defeated McDermott for the seat, winning by more than 140,000 votes in the city-wide election, a reduced but still sizable majority compared with the 1959 at-large vote. In the 10th district, Winkleman retained the seat for his party, dispatching McDermott by more than 10,000 votes, but with a smaller percentage than McDevitt's 1959 total. 

The one surprise result was in the 8th district as Smullen picked up the seat for the Republicans in what the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Daily%20News">Philadelphia Daily News</a>" called "a major upset." The results meant that the Democratic majority on the council was reduced to 13 to 3. All three races showed a roughly five percentage point increase in the Republican vote, in line with the increases in row office elections <a href="Philadelphia%20municipal%20election%2C%201961">the previous year</a>.

Aftermath.
Pytko remained on city council until 1967, when he retired. His opponent, McDermott, ran for mayor <a href="Philadelphia%20municipal%20election%2C%201963">in 1963</a>, but was unsuccessful. He was appointed to a judgeship on the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Court%20of%20Common%20Pleas">Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas</a> in 1967 and was elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1981. He and Pytko in died the same week in June 1992.

Winkelman and Smullen both saw their election results reversed the following year when a Republican won the 10th district and a Democrat won the 8th. Smullen remained active at the ward level and in his business but, after an unsuccessful attempt at a state house seat in 1964, never ran for office again. Winkelman ran again in 1967 and for an at-large seat in 1971, but was unsuccessful. Both of their opponents later became judges: McGlynn on the federal bench and Geisz on the Court of Common Pleas.

<doc id="54921237" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54921237" title="James Keating">
James Keating

Sir James Keating (died after 1491) was an Irish cleric and statesman of the fifteenth century. He was Prior of the Irish house of the <a href="Knights%20Hospitallers">Knights Hospitallers</a> and a member of the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20Ireland">Privy Council of Ireland</a>. Despite his political eminence he was a man of ruthless character and violent temper who once tried to <a href="murder">murder</a> a senior judge, and was directly responsible for the death of his designated successor as Prior. After a long and turbulent career he was removed from office for his <a href="treason">treason</a> in supporting the Simnel Rebellion of 1487 and died in poverty.

Biography.
He was born in <a href="Bree%2C%20County%20Wexford">Bree, County Wexford</a>. He joined the Order of Knights Hospitallers, rose rapidly through its ranks and in 1461 became Prior of the Order's Irish house at <a href="Kilmainham">Kilmainham</a>. 

Almost immediately after his appointment as Prior, he committed a crime which might well have ended his career and even his life. At <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> 1462 Sir <a href="Robert%20Dowdall">Robert Dowdall</a>, the <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20Irish%20Common%20Pleas">Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas</a>, came on a <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to Kilmainham. Keating attacked him with a sword and appears to have had every intention of killing him. The motive for the attack is unknown although crimes of violence, even among the ruling class were not uncommon in that era: twenty years earlier another senior Irish judge, Chief Baron <a href="James%20%20Cornwalsh">James Cornwalsh</a>, had been murdered.

Keating was arrested and <a href="arraigned">arraigned</a> for trial before Parliament, but the charges were dropped on condition that he pay Dowdall damages (although it seems that he never actually did so). This was probably due to the influence of the powerful magnate <a href="Thomas%20FitzGerald%2C%20%207th%20Earl%20of%20Kildare">Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare</a>, who acted as Keating's patron. For the next few years he seems to have run the Order smoothly enough. He was later accused of bankrupting the Irish house: in his defence he pointed out that his superiors in Rhodes in 1467 had increased the annual payment due to them from Ireland from £40 to £70 without consultation or any regard to the Irish house's ability to pay, and he was hard put to find the extra money.

Politics.
As Prior of Kilmainham he was entitled to sit in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Parliament of Ireland</a> and on the Privy Council and was expected to play a key role in Irish politics. During the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, the dynastic struggle between rival branches of the English Royal family, Keating in common with almost all the Anglo-Irish nobility favoured the <a href="House%20of%20York">House of York</a> over the rival <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">House of Lancaster</a>. The victory of York over Lancaster in the year Keating became Prior should therefore have increased his standing. However he was in temporary disgrace when in 1467 King <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a> sent the notoriously ruthless <a href="John%20Tiptoft%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Worcester">John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester</a> to be <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a>."" Worcester held a Parliament at <a href="Drogheda">Drogheda</a> where he proceeded to deal with those whom he regarded as his enemies, including the Earl of Kildare, who fled abroad, and Keating, who was imprisoned.

Lord Grey.
His fortunes improved after the House of Lancaster, which had briefly regained the throne in 1470-1, were finally crushed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tewkesbury">Battle of Tewkesbury</a>. Among the defeated Lancastrians to suffer death as a result was Sir John Langstrother, Prior of the English Hospitallers. Keating by contrast was commended by the victorious Yorkists for his loyalty. In 1478 however he clashed again with the English Crown when King Edward, to strengthen his authority, sent <a href="Henry%20Grey%2C%204th%20%287th%29%20Baron%20Grey%20of%20Codnor">Lord Grey of Codnor</a> to be Lord Lieutenant. The Anglo-Irish nobles, led by <a href="Gerald%20FitzGerald%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Kildare">Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare</a> and his father-in-law <a href="Baron%20Portlester">Baron Portlester</a>, simply refused to recognize his authority: Keating who had assumed the role of Constable of <a href="Dublin%20Castle">Dublin Castle</a>, apparently by force, played a key role in these events by refusing Lord Grey entry to the Castle. After a few months of deadlock, the King yielded and Grey returned to England. leaving Keating and his allies triumphant.

Marmaduke Lumley.
The next threat to his position came from his own superiors in <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, who were outraged by his refusal to give any assistance against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Rhodes%20%281480%29">Siege of Rhodes (1480)</a>. In 1482 he was removed from office and replaced by an English member of the Order, Marmaduke Lumley, who obtained <a href="Papal">Papal</a> approval for his election. Keating however was not a man to submit lightly to such a decision, and when Lumley landed at <a href="Clontarf%2C%20Dublin">Clontarf, Dublin</a>, Keating led a large force which captured and imprisoned him, and later put him in chains. Both the <a href="Papal%20Legate">Papal Legate</a> Octavio de Palatio, and the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Dublin">Archbishop of Dublin</a>, <a href="John%20Walton%20%28bishop%29">John Walton</a>, expressed their outrage and demanded Lumley's release. In 1484 they even sent a force to free him, but Keating, who was a trained soldier like all his Order, easily defeated it. Lumley died in prison soon after. Keating was excommunicated for his actions, but true to his character, simply ignored the <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a>.

Downfall.
The downfall of the House of York at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bosworth">Battle of Bosworth</a> in 1485, and the establishment of the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor dynasty</a> under King <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a> was unwelcome news to the pro-Yorkist <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> nobility, led by the Earl of Kildare and Lord Portlester, and their resistance to the House of Tudor led to Keating's ultimate ruin. In 1487 Kildare, Portlester, Keating and their allies made the mistake of supporting the claims of the <a href="pretender">pretender</a> <a href="Lambert%20Simnel">Lambert Simnel</a>, who claimed to be <a href="Edward%20Plantagenet%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick</a>, the rightful heir of the House of York. Simnel was an imposter, but was said to strongly resemble the real Warwick, who was a prisoner in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. 
Simnel was crowned in Dublin and invaded England with a large army, only to be crushed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stoke%20Field">Battle of Stoke Field</a>.

Henry VII was remarkably merciful in victory: Simnel became a royal servant and almost all of the Anglo-Irish nobility received a <a href="royal%20pardon">royal pardon</a>. The one notable exception was Keating, whose record of violence, and defiance both of the Crown and his own superiors evidently made it impossible for the King to trust him. The Crown chose to regard him as the "prime instigator" of the rebellion, although historians usually give that role to the Earl of Kildare. Despite repeated pleas he was refused a pardon and deprived of office once more. With all his old stubbornness he refused to leave Kilmainham, but was finally ejected in 1491. He died in poverty soon afterwards.

Oshkosh Alpha

The Oshkosh Alpha is a <a href="MRAP">Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected</a> vehicle created by Oshkosh Corporation together with Protected Vehicles Incorporated. It is considered as a Category I MRAP vehicle.

The Alpha was marketed to eventually phase out the use of the <a href="Humvee">Humvee</a>.

History.
The Oshkosh Alpha was first revealed to the public in September 12, 2006 at the Modern Day Marine show in Quantico, Virginia with the <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Systems%20Command">US Marine Corp Systems Command</a> awarding a contract for 100 Alphas for USD$30.6 million. Oshkosh announced on February 26, 2007 that it would supply the MRAPs within 120 days. 

During its production, the vehicle was given the codename of "Bulldog". 

MCSC announced on June 29, 2007 that the contract was cancelled due to design concerns, such as ergonomic and automotive deficiencies as well as questionable vehicle survivability. It's mentioned that the time needed to give the Alpha a redesign would delay future production orders.

As of 2017, Oshkosh has halted sales of the Alpha since PVI went bankrupt in 2007. Most Alphas made prior to the tender being discontinued have been transferred to units of the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>, the <a href="Naval%20Criminal%20Investigative%20Service">Naval Criminal Investigative Service</a> and the <a href="U.S.%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>.

Design.
Oshkosh and PVI worked together to create the vehicle with Oshkosh handling production capabilities and engineering experience while PVI created its armored chassis. The MRAP has a capacity for a total of 8 persons with a V-shaped hull with a monoque layout used to deflect mine and other explosive blasts. It's also capable of being transported to the field by air transport.

The MRAP is equipped with ShieldAll armor made in cooperation with Batelle. ShieldAll is based on available components, including FlexAll hyperplastic material. ShieldAll is made with the weight being one-third lighter and less bulky than steel. Depending on operational needs, the Alpha can have add-on armor added. 

The Alpha's armored body was created based on research done for NASCAR while developing ShieldAll, in part due to its shock-absorbing properties.

The Alpha has all-round protection against 7.62mm bullets. It can also withstand <a href=".50%20BMG">.50 BMG</a> bullets. During Explosively Formed Projectile tests, it was able to survive against multiple EFP explosives.

It can be equipped with either 7.62-mm/12.7-mm machine guns or 40-mm automatic grenade launcher on the roof.

Judy Hornby

Judy Hornby, also known as Judith Hornby, is a British-born American-based former model, fashion designer and boutique owner. In 1971 one of her ensembles, designed for her by <a href="Graziella%20Fontana">Graziella Fontana</a>, was chosen as the <a href="Dress%20of%20the%20Year">Dress of the Year</a>. She then went on to become a successful American fashion designer.

Career.
Hornby was originally a model, before entering fashion design and retail. She commissioned samples and garments from freelance designers such as <a href="Graziella%20Fontana">Graziella Fontana</a>. The <a href="Fashion%20Museum%2C%20Bath">Fashion Museum, Bath</a> asked <a href="Serena%20Sinclair">Serena Sinclair</a>, voted Fashion Writer Of The Year in 1970, to choose the defining look for 1971 to add to their <a href="Dress%20of%20the%20Year">Dress of the Year</a> collection. Sinclair selected one of Fontana's <a href="Liberty%20%28department%20store%29">Liberty</a>-print cotton <a href="hotpants">hotpants</a> ensembles for Hornby as her womenswear look, alongside a <a href="Blades%20%28boutique%29">Blades</a> man's suit.

As a designer, Hornby enjoyed mixing printed textiles, and in 1972, the unisex quality of some of her work was noted by "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>". By 1975, due to export regulations, she had left the United Kingdom to live and work in the United States. She opened a small boutique with only one in-house seamstress on East 60th Street, Manhattan, called Hornby of Plenty, in September 1975, which was well-received by buyers who had formerly had to travel to London to see her wholesale collections. Hornby of Plenty swiftly gained a good reputation due to its dedicated customer service and willingness to alter and even make new garments to fit clients at no extra cost, meaning that by December 1975, Hornby had to employ eight additional seamstresses to meet demand. In 1979, Hornby was selling her work to over 40 shops across the United States, and was described as a master of unexpected colour and pattern mixes which looked anything but haphazard. By the 1980s, she was considered a leading designer alongside <a href="Zandra%20Rhodes">Zandra Rhodes</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Burrows%20%28designer%29">Stephen Burrows</a>. "<a href="Women%27s%20Wear%20Daily">Women's Wear Daily</a>" reported in 1994 that Hornby had stepped in to take over the Chicago-based <a href="Becky%20Bisoulis">Becky Bisoulis</a> brand after Bisoulis fell ill.

Later life.
By 2005, Hornby had moved to Connecticut and opened an antiques shop there, also offering antique-buying trips to France for American collectors. Her husband, Jerry Larrabue, is a vintage watch dealer.

He earned his <a href="Masters%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Masters of Fine Arts</a> degree in <a href="painting">painting</a> from Howard in 1976.

Background.
Gerald Williams was born in 1941 on the south side of Chicago, Illinois. He grew up on South Evans Street, a block from <a href="Oak%20Woods%20Cemetery">Oak Woods Cemetery</a>, in the Woodlawn neighborhood, in a house he shared with his mother, his father and 11 siblings. His father worked in the steel mills at <a href="South%20Works">South Works</a> that were then prevalent around the area where the <a href="Calumet%20River">Calumet River</a> meets <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>. In 1963, midway toward receiving his accounting degree from Roosevelt University, Williams left college and joined the United States Air Force as an illustrator. He did his basic training at <a href="Lackland%20Air%20Force%20Base">Lackland Air Force Base</a> in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, and was then assigned to the graphics shop at <a href="McChord%20Air%20Force%20Base">McChord Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma, Washington</a>.

After leaving the Air Force in 1966, Williams returned to Chicago to finish school. While working toward his BA at Chicago Teachers College, he met an artist named <a href="Jeff%20Donaldson%20%28artist%29">Jeff Donaldson</a>, who was on the faculty there. Donaldson invited Williams to join him and several other black artists who had started getting together casually once a week to discuss aesthetics. At the time, Williams was also renting studio space in a coach house in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20Chicago">Hyde Park</a>. After attending the first meeting with Donaldson and the others, Williams realized that, unbeknownst to him, another member of the group, <a href="Wadsworth%20Jarrell">Wadsworth Jarrell</a>, was the artist who was renting the other side of the coach house. Over the course of the next few years, Williams, Donaldson, Jarrell, along with <a href="Jae%20Jarrell">Jae Jarrell</a> and Barbara J. Jones, became the nucleus of AfriCOBRA, one of the most influential, transnational black art movements of the <a href="20th%20Century">20th Century</a>.

Jana Kolarič

Jana Kolarič (born 17 September 1954) is a Slovene author and translator. She is the author of plays and novels for both children and adults, and has been recognised as an exceptional artist by the Ministry of Culture. She has won a number of literary awards.

Career.
Jana Kolarič was born on 17 September 1954 in <a href="Maribor">Maribor</a>, where she attended elementary and secondary school.
In 1979 she completed her AGRF ("Akademija za Gledališče, Radio, Film") course in <a href="Ljubljana">Ljubljana</a> with a degree in film and TV directing.
She worked in a variety of jobs after completing her studies, including as consultant for educational TV, lecturer in art education, mentor of a drama group, cultural animator, journalist and editor of school books for a publishing house.
As of 2010 she was working as a translator of literature, particularly poetry and fairy tales, and by lecturing.
She is married and the mother of four children.

Literary activity.
Jana Kolarič has regularly published poems and plays.
In 1976 she created a successful play for children, "Salon Expon".
While working for the Tuma publishing house she was responsible for "Primadona", a collection of 12 plays with detailed staging instructions adapted to schools.
She joined the <a href="Slovene%20Writers%27%20Association">Slovene Writers' Association</a> (DSP: "Društvo slovenskih pisateljev") in January 2004. 
She received recognition as a leading artist from the Ministry of Culture in October 2004.
In 2004 she published a drama for adults, "Kdo le so oni?", and in 2005 a collection of puzzles, "Ugibanke male, oblecene v šale".
Kolarič drew the puzzles in this book, which was designed for children.

Kolarič's novel "Izpred kongresa" received special mention by the jury in a 2004 modern Slovene novel competition run by the Mladinska Knjiga publishing house.
The science fiction book was Kolaric's debut novel, based on adults being cloned at a huge clinic, and was published by Mladinska Knjiga in 2006.
She translated two children's picture books for the Miš publishing house: "Moja sestra Zala" and "Kuštravi Slave z Mlekarske pristave".
She published a collection of short dramatic scripts "Dobro jutro, lutke" (2007) for the Genija publishing house.
In 2008 she published her second novel, co-authored with Tatjano Kokalj, "Draga Alina, draga Brina".
As of 2010 her second co-authored novel was ready for publication, "Zima z ognjenim šalom".

In a 2009 interview Kolarič noted that the market for Slovene literature was small and it was hard to make money.
Most writers had a full-time job, usually in education, and wrote when they had the time.
She had to take whatever work was available, including teaching, translating, writing books, editing and sometimes helping stage plays.
She felt that the media raised impossible expectations of a woman's role, describing a super-woman with a stylish way of life who is the perfect professional artist, who supports her children, husband and parents, and who is a breadwinner and markets their own books.
She felt that women writers had to overcome prejudice against negative views of emotional aspects of their work, labeled as "sentimental", "melodramatic" or "weak".
She had won competitions only when she consciously adopted a male style of writing.

Selected awards.
Kolarič's radio play "Upanje na bogastvo" won third prize at the 60th anniversary competition of Trieste Radio Studios.
Trieste Radio Studios staged the play in 2007.
Her radio play "Odiseja 3000" won first prize in the 2007 Radia Slovenija competition, and was staged by <a href="Radio%20Slovenija">Radio Slovenija</a> in 2008.
The children's play is about life on different planets and what is new on earth. 
Her short story "Barva marsovskih hlac" was selected in the <a href="International%20Board%20on%20Books%20for%20Young%20People">International Board on Books for Young People</a> Slovene section as representative of Slovenia in the March 2009 world youth anthology in India.
In 2011 her story "Goli goli" won third place in a competition organized by Ljubljana's Student Publishing Company.
In 2013 Jana Kolaric won the first <a href="Literary%20Death%20Match">Literary Death Match</a> competition in Ljubljana, where she read a short story with a tragic and unexpected end about a woman babysitting her niece.

NGC 5460

NGC 5460 is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> in the constellation <a href="Centaurus%20%28constellation%29">Centaurus</a>. It is a bright but loose cluster of intermediate age located approximately 2,300 light years away from Earth. It is located nearly 2 degrees east-southeast of <a href="Zeta%20Centauri">Zeta Centauri</a>.

Observation history.
NGC 5460 was discovered by <a href="James%20Dunlop">James Dunlop</a> in 1826. He descripted it on May 7, 1826 as "a curiously curved line of small stars, of nearly equal magnitudes; two stars of 7th magnitude to the east" and added it to his catalog as number 431. <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> descripted as "a region of large bright stars of 8, 9... etc. magnitude; a very coarse cluster" and added it to General Catalogue as No. 3555. In the <a href="New%20General%20Catalogue">New General Catalogue</a> it is descripted as "very large, very little concentrated, stars 8th magnitude and fainter". 

Characteristics.
NGC 5460 is a loose open cluster, of Trumper type II3m. There are 272 probable member stars within the angular radius of the cluster and 96 within the central part of the cluster. The tidal radius of the cluster is 4.1 - 8.2 parsecs (13 - 26 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 5460, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core.

A photometric study by Barrado and Byrne in 1995 studied 353 stars near the core of the cluster and identified 25 members and 27 possible members. They estimated the age of the cluster to be 110 mys and its distance to be 740 pc and identified three stars, members and possible members, as <a href="variable%20star">variable</a>. A spectographic study of the cluster by Fossati et al. (2011) estimated the distance of the cluster to be 720 ± 50 pc, its age log t=8.2 ± 0.1 and the mean radial velocity −17.9 ± 5.2 km/s. The <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> of the cluster is slightly higher than the solar one (Z = 0.013). 

The brightest of the members is HD 123226 (mag. 8.98, B8), which is also the hottest star of the cluster. One more star, HD 122983, (mag. 9.77, B9.5IV/V) has been found to be variable, with period 3.4 days. It is a <a href="Chemically%20peculiar%20star">He-weak star</a>. Other chemically peculiar stars within the cluster are HD 123182 (He-weak star of an unclear type, mag. 9.88, spectral type B9), and UCAC 11105038 (mag. 11.59, A8). Also, the hotter component of the HD 123225 system may be an HgMn star.

This movement was based on traditional occults practices originated from the <a href="kingdom%20of%20kongo">kingdom of kongo</a> in central <a href="Africa">Africa</a>.

Prima Curia was criticized to be a dangerous <a href="cult">cult</a> from African <a href="sorcery">sorcery</a> and <a href="fetishes">fetishes</a> mostly passed from word of mouth.

According to Pastor Jonas<a href="http%3A//www.mcreveil.org/Francais/sorcellerie/pstjonas_fr12.html"></a> who claimed to be an ex satanist and ex member of Prima Curia, this occult movement had led to commit terrible mistakes in his life. Also, some political members in the time of Mobutu, have used the name Prima Curia to identify this cult.

Today

Today Prima Curia movement continues to exist secretly in central and southern African countries.
According to Vitriol who claimed to be the modern "leader and revolutionary of Prima Curia", this movement is not affiliated with any other religious group. But traditional practices of Prima Curia still existing in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="New%20Orlean">New Orlean</a> in the <nowiki><a href="US">US</a></nowiki> and other southern American countries.

Belief

Followers of Prima Curia believe in <a href="magick">magick</a> and spirituality with purpose of healing and better life on earth. The teachings are divided in to two:

The African traditional spirituality such as the use of natural plants, African gods and worship.

And the western magick style such as Hermetic, and the study of Solomonic magick. 

Leader

John Kalambay, also known as 'Vitriol Master' a very controversial Christian Evangelist, author and current leader of Prima Curia in southern African countries and central. 

He is the man who says to have revolutioned the movement by documenting, promoting and recruiting members. He also baptized Prima Curia a religion of " new age".

Book: "The amazing questions and spiritual techniques of Magick, a book of 70 rituals".

His <a href="motto">motto</a> V.I.T.R.I.O.L<a href="https%3A//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_formula"></a> is a magical formula known in <a href="Thelema">Thelema</a> meaning: "Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultem Lapidem". (Visiting the interior of the Earth, rectifying comes the Occult Stone). Ancient alchemical formula.

Vitriol claimed Prima Curia to basically be a traditional Congolese religion founded in the years 1706 by a high priestess known as <a href="Kimpa%20Vita">Kimpa Vita</a>. He illustrated Kimpa Vita as one of the most powerful <a href="spiritual">spiritual</a> woman who had mastered the secrets of this tradition. He also added kimpa Vita on the list of <a href="saints">saints</a> to be worshipped in the modern Prima Curia.

In Vitriol’s non published book "L'histoire de Prima Curia", it is said: 

"Mobutu was known to be a very spiritual man and continued to seek <a href="spirituality">spirituality</a> until death". And that Mobutu's entourage, friends from Europe had a time of discussing and sharing their spiritual <a href="knowledge">knowledge</a>. It was from that moment the " court des grands" movement started to expand, followed by the <a href="Mobutism">Mobutism</a> <a href="ideology">ideology</a>.

It contains a variety of famous burials and a number of <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a> connected features. The site is at 110 Dallas Avenue approximately 0.7 mile west of downtown Selma. (GPS coordinates: 32.405306, -87.032028) 


Confederate Circle.
The graves of soldiers are to the south of the Confederate Soldier Monument with cannons pointing north, forever protecting the deceased Confederates. Elodie Todd Dawson, buried nearby, was head of the Ladies Memorial Association (later the <a href="United%20Daughters%20of%20the%20Confederacy">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a>) and spearheaded the effort to build the $5,500 Confederate Monument in the cemetery. 155 soldier bodies were moved from elsewhere to be around the monument.


Elodie Todd Dawson Monument.
The Elodie Todd Dawson Monument marks the graves of Elodie Todd Dawson (April 1, 1844-NOv 14, 1881) and her husband Confederate Brig. General <a href="Nathaniel%20H.%20R.%20Dawson">Nathaniel H. R. Dawson</a> (1829-1895). Elodie Todd Dawson was the half-sister of <a href="Mary%20Todd%20Lincoln">Mary Todd Lincoln</a> the wife of President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Her parents were Robert Smith Todd (1791 - 1849) and Elizabeth L Humphreys Todd (1800 - 1874) and she had 17 full or half siblings. Elodie Dawson was a staunch Confederate supporter who spearheaded the effort to erect the Confederate Soldier Monument.

After his wife's death, Col. Dawson ordered the sculpture of his wife from Italy, but when it arrived he was dissatisfied with the hair which he judged to be less beautiful than his wife's hair, so he sent the statute back to Italy for a rework. In addition to the much photographed sculpture, Col. Dawson procured many of the magnolia and live oak trees in the cemetery from Mobile in 1879.

After the war Dawson was appointed U.S. Commissioner of Education, the first from Alabama. Dawson also served as a member of the Alabama legislature which included serving as Speaker of the House. He was an organizer in the Democratic Party. Dawson was considered a leading citizen of Selma who raised money for Selma's Charity Hospital and Dallas Academy. He was a church leader at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, where his funeral was held.

In 2015, the Elodie Todd Dawson sculpture was named one of Alabama's "most photographed cemetery monuments".

The Pigeon House.
A structure also called the Spring House, but now used for storage, sits near the Confederate Soldier Monument. The unusual name arises from the gables that were designed as bird houses, since closed to preserve the structure. The building was used <a href="Confederate%20Memorial%20Day">Confederate Memorial Day</a> band concerts and programs each Spring.

Albion (1800 ship)

Albion was launched at Topsham, Devon, in 1800. She spent most of her career sailing between London and Jamaica. After 1814 she held a license from the British <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> to trade with India, but she does not appear to have availed herself of the option before she was condemned at Charleston, South Carolina, and broken up in 1816. In 1814 the American privateer "Brutus" captured "Albion", but the British recaptured her within a few days.

Career.
"Albion" first appears in "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" in 1800.

Capture and recapture.
On 25 December 1814, towards the end of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, the American privateer schooner "Brutus" captured "Albion", "Skoulding", master, off the coast of Ireland as "Albion" was sailing to Bermuda from England. "Brutus" was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 120 men. Even so, "Albion" resisted for some two hours.

"Brutus", of Boston, was under the command of Captain William Austin. American records indicate that at the time of capture "Albion", of 350 tons, was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 15 men. Her captors estimated the value of "Albion"s cargo at $200,000. Austin put a prize crew on board her and sent her to America.

However, on 7 January 1815 "Harlequin", Allen, master, recaptured "Albion", "Scolding", master, at and sent her into Liverpool.

Fate.
As "Albion" was sailing from Jamaica to London, Curry had to put into Charleston as she was in some distress. At Charleston the surveyors condemned her as unseaworthy. She was sold on 11 January 1816 for breaking up. Her cargo was put on "Commerce", Wilson, master.

Trumpeter Hino played there in 1969. In 1970, the standard entrance charges were 450 Yen for the 2pm show and 500 Yen for the 7pm one, with one drink included. It was described as "A comfortably dingy, often smoke-filled niche for the serious jazz fan [...] over the years it had been home to performances and recordings by some of the world's greatest jazz musicians". In January 1992, it was forced to close, as the building it was part of was being demolished.

Second Shinjuku Pit Inn.
The Pit Inn reopened in July 1992, at a new location in Shinjuku. It continued to offer an afternoon and an evening performance, with the former being for less-well-established musicians.

A34 crash

On 10th August 2017 at approximately 17:10BST, a lorry collided with a number of other vehicles. As a result four people died and twelve were injured, one seriously injured. The case was significant as it lead to the penalty for using a mobile phone whilst driving being doubled.

The crash.
A 44 tonne (44,000kg) lorry was travelling at approximately 50mph (80kph) along the A34 in Buckinghamshire, England. It smashed head on into eight vehicles in front. Everyone in the third car died due to the fact that it had been crushed to a third of its usual size by the lorry. The victims were; Tracy, Ethan and Joshua Houghton, as well as Aimee Goldsmith.

Police investigation.
The lorry driver was arrested pending further inquiries. Witnesses said that the driver made no effort to stop until it was too late. When questioned on this , the lorry driver said that he had tried to stop but the brakes would not work. Examination of the lorry showed that the brakes were not faulty, so the police checked the dash cam to see what had happened. It showed footage of the driver scrolling through music on his phone moments before the crash, he did not notice the tailback of traffic I front of him.

Charges and sentencing.
As a result of the evidence, the CPS decided to charge Tomasz Kroker with four counts of causing death by dangerous driving and one count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
He appeared at the local magistrates court of 9th September 2016, where he was remanded in custody.
On 10th October 2016, Kroker pleaded guilty to all charges against him.
On 31st October, Kroker was jailed for 10 years on each count of causing death by dangerous driving and four years for causing serious injury by dangerous driving. The sentences were to run concurrently meaning that they will be served at the same time. Tomasz Kroker will be able to apply for parole on 10/10/2021.

Aftermath.
Due to the fact that the penalties for using a mobile phone whilst driving did not seem to deter people from doing it, the government passed legislation to double the penalty for using a phone whilst driving from 3 points and £100 fine to 6 points and £200 fine. These new rules came into force on 1st March 2017 and mean that new drivers lose their license for 6 months when caught. Experienced drivers can be banned for 6 months if caught twice.
Parliament also announced a review of the sentencing for causing death by dangerous driving, the maximum sentence could potentially be increased to life imprisonment in the future.

Since 28 November 2016 she has been her country's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Health%20%28Denmark%29">Minister of Health</a>.

Life.
Provenance and early years.
Ellen Trane Nørby was born in <a href="Herning">Herning</a>, a midsized manufacturing and administrative town in the centre of <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a>. She grew up in <a href="N%C3%B8rre%20Nissum">Nørre Nissum</a>, a large village on the edge of <a href="Lemvig">Lemvig</a> along country's west coast. Jørgen Andreas Nørby, her father, is a biologist and secondary school teacher who served as municipal mayor of Lemvig between 1998 and 2006. Her mother is an architect. Nørby attended school in Nørre Nissum between 1985 and 1995, then moving on to the <a href="Gymnasium%20%28Denmark%29">Gymnasium (Upper School)</a> at Lemwig. She enrolled at <a href="Copenhagen%20University">Copenhagen University</a> where from 1998 she studied <a href="Art%20History">Art History</a>, with a side module between 1999 and 2001 on political sciences. She concluded her university level studies in 2005 with a "Master of Arts" degree.

While still a student she had already worked at the <a href="Christiansborg%20Palace">Christiansborg Palace</a>, home to <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>'s <a href="Politics%20of%20Denmark">government</a> and <a href="Folketing">national parliament</a>.

Political career.
She joined the <a href="Venstre%20%28Denmark%29">Venstre</a> party and its youth organisation in 1995. In 1999 she became vice-president of the <a href="European%20Liberal%20Youth">European Liberal Youth</a> organisation comprising, for the most part, the youth wings of members of the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe%20Party">Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party</a>. Between 2002 and 2004 she was the . In 2004 she stood for <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202004">election to the European parliament</a>. Her 24,380 votes were not sufficient to win her a seat in the assembly, however.

She stood for <a href="Danish%20general%20election%2C%202005">election to the national parliament in 2005</a>. <a href="Venstre%20%28Denmark%29">Venstre</a> had been in power as the largest party in a coalition government since <a href="Danish%20general%20election%2C%202001">2001</a>, and although their support slipped in 2005 they remained the largest party. Nørby won 5,073 votes which was enough to secure her a seat in <a href="Folketing">parliament</a>. She became her party's spokesperson for culture and the arts. Support for <a href="Venstre%20%28Denmark%29">Venstre</a> slipped again in <a href="Danish%20general%20election%2C%202007">2007</a>, but they were still, by a small margin, the largest party. Nørby's own support increased to 12,804 votes in her <a href="South%20Jutland">South Jutland</a> electoral district. In this parliamentary session her focus was on social issues and gender equality. Her vote level increased again in <a href="Danish%20general%20election%2C%202011">2011</a>, this time to 18,059 votes. This was the highest number of votes received by any of the <a href="Venstre%20%28Denmark%29">Venstre</a> candidates in 2011. Her 12,012 votes in the <a href="Danish%20general%20election%2C%202015">2015</a> election were again comfortably more than were won by most (if, this time, not quite all) of her fellow Venstre candidates. Between 2006 and her first ministerial appointment, in 2015, Ellen Trane Nørby was her party's spokesperson on "new media" questions.

On 28 June 2015 she was appointed <a href="Education%20Minister%20of%20Denmark">Minister for Children, Education and Equality</a> in the <a href="Lars%20L%C3%B8kke%20Rasmussen%20II%20Cabinet">Lars Løkke Rasmussen minority government</a> formed that year. On 28 November 2016, when that government was replaced by the <a href="Lars%20L%C3%B8kke%20Rasmussen%20III%20Cabinet">Lars Løkke Rasmussen coalition government</a>, she was transferred to the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Health%20%28Denmark%29">Ministry of Health</a>.

Media profile.
In Autumn 2012, as an opposition spokesperson, Ellen Trane Nørby submitted 696 parliamentary questions to <a href="Uffe%20Elb%C3%A6k">Uffe Elbæk</a>, the <a href="Culture%20Minister%20of%20Denmark">Minister for Culture and The Arts</a>. This performance earned Nørby the soubriquet "Spørge-Ellen" (""Questions Ellen"") from the mass-market tabloid newspaper <a href="BT%20%28tabloid%29">BT</a>.

A more negative press encounter came about in January 2013 when the <a href="BT%20%28tabloid%29">BT</a> journalist reported the allegation that student supporters working for Nørby had made more than thirty changes to her <a href="Danish%20Wikipedia">Danish Wikipedia</a> entry since March 2011. She reacted promptly and fiercely, asserting that she was being subjected to a "journalistic campaign of personal hatred" from the tabloid <a href="BT%20%28tabloid%29">BT</a>, which was then being picked up and reported without critical evaluation by other press outlets.

Personal.
Ellen Trane Nørby is married and has a daughter.

Rokko Junior and Senior High School

Rokko Junior and Senior High School in Kobe City, <a href="Hy%C5%8Dgo%20Prefecture">Hyōgo Prefecture</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> school founded in 1937, was the first <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> secondary school in Japan. It offers an integrated middle and high school education for boys and does not recruit at the high school level.

History.
The <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> had opened <a href="Sophia%20University">Sophia University</a> in 1913. Its next educational venture was Rokko middle school in 1937. With the completion of a wooden building it was named Rokko Junior High School in 1938. It accepted 12-year-olds for a 5-year program leading to the secondary school degree. There were 15 on the staff and 135 first-year pupils in 1938. The Hansen <a href="List%20of%20floods%231930s">flood in 1938</a> damaged the building and grounds. In 1941 a four-story reinforced concrete building was completed.

Amidst the war crisis of 1945, in April classes were interrupted but students were encouraged to study privately. The school was damaged by an air raid that hit <a href="Kobe%20University">Kobe University</a>. The war ended on August 13 and classes resumed in September. The following years saw numerous adjustments in the junior/middle school program. The school continues to follow the seven-year, pre-<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> system.

In 1950 the school foundation was renamed Rokko Academy School. Construction continued through the '60s and '70s: an auditorium and gymnasium (1957), <a href="Mount%20Tate">Mount Tate</a> camp (1961), building expansion (1965), science building (1966), 36-km walking course (1967), swimming pool (1968), Kumihama beach school building (1971), annex and chapel (1974). In 1976 the baseball club won the 31st National (Wakasugi, Saga Prefecture) championship. Further improvements: Tateyama Hutte (1979), clubhouse and archery field (1981), new auditorium and completion of gymnasium (1987). Trips to India began in 1985, a student training institute in 1988, New Zealand language training in 1992. In 2010 a temporary school building was utilized as the old one was replaced with a new one occupied in 2012. A camp at <a href="Tokashiki%2C%20Okinawa">Maejima, Okinawa</a>, replaced the one at <a href="Kumihama%20Station">Kumihama</a> in 2017. 

In April 2016 five Jesuit academies joined into a new corporation, called the Sophia Academy Corporation, to consolidate their efforts and strengthen their Jesuit identity, as through common programs for teachers. The corporation is centered at Sophia University, which will lend its assistance to the schools. In this way, with the declining number of Jesuits, the Jesuit influence is more likely to endure. These schools are <a href="Hiroshima%20Academy%20Junior%20and%20Senior%20High%20School">Hiroshima Academy</a>, Rokko Academy, <a href="Sophia%20Fukuoka%20Junior%20and%20Senior%20High%20School">Sophia Academy</a>, Taizon Academy, and <a href="Glory%20Academy%2C%20Kamakura">Glory Academy</a>, along with <a href="Elisabeth%20University%20of%20Music">Elisabeth University of Music</a>. 

The school is situated on a <a href="promontory">promontory</a> overlooking <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a> and <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Seto Inland Sea</a>. It is a 25-minute walk from Rokko station on the Hankyu Railway line, and a 10 and 15 minute walk from two Kobe city bus stops.

Academics and activities.
The school pursues the Jesuit ideal of training "men for others." Special aspects of its program include close contact with parents, active learning with projects outside school, and group language studies. Total enrollment is around 1,100. 

There is no examination for admission to high school except to fill vacancies. While all English classes aim at entrance to <a href="Kyoto%20University">Kyoto University</a>, students can choose from three levels of mathematics education. 

The alumni join together in the Rokko Friends Association.

Gymnastics are included in the program during the winter months. Students assist with the cleaning of the school. A sports festival is held in June, third-year students attend Tateyama camp in July, and they along with second year high do community service in August. A visit to India program is run every other year. A Cultural Festival is held in September, Extracurricular Learning in October, and Walking Competition in November. In December there is a ski training camp for middle 2. A spiritual reflection day is held each January. High school graduation is in February and middle school in March.

Activities take place three days a week and most first year high school students take part. Archery is an activity in which the students have competed at the national level.

Community service.
Social outreach includes a monthly collection for Damian Social Welfare Center in India; community service days during summer vacation (middle 3 to high 2); day to think about life in January; and monthly religious lecture (<a href="Magis">Magis</a> day).

Student Council.
Students are elected to this organization which has a voice at school staff meetings. It includes various committees: training and discipline, community service, library, gymnastics, and for the junior high school.

Tatsutagawa stable

Tatsutagawa stable was a <a href="heya%20%28sumo%29">heya</a> of <a href="sumo">sumo</a> wrestlers, part of the Tokitsukaze "<a href="ichimon">ichimon</a>" or group of stables. It was active from 1971 until 1988.

History.
The stable was founded in 1971 by the former "<a href="yokozuna">yokozuna</a>" <a href="Kagamisato%20Kiyoji">Kagamisato</a>. He had become head coach of the <a href="Tokitsukaze%20stable">Tokitsukaze stable</a> in 1968 upon the death of the previous stablemaster, <a href="Futabayama%20Sadaji">Futabayama</a>, but was forced out because Futabayama's widow (who retained the rights of the stable and its premises) wanted the former "<a href="ozeki">ozeki</a>" <a href="Yutakayama%20Katsuo">Yutakayama Katsuo</a> in charge instead. Kagamisato took the <a href="toshiyori">elder</a> name of Tatsutagawa (which had previously been used by several "<a href="gyoji">gyoji</a>" but had remained vacant since 1961) and set up the stable without taking any recruits with him from Tokitsukaze stable. He was joined by Tatsutayama Oyakata, the former "ozeki" <a href="Ouchiyama">Ouchiyama</a>, who worked as a coach at the new stable until his death in 1985. The stable was unable to attract many promising wrestlers and Kagamisato reached the <a href="Japan%20Sumo%20Association">Japan Sumo Association</a>'s mandatory retirement age of 65 in April 1988 without having produced any top division wrestlers, and just one "<a href="sekitori">sekitori</a>," <a href="Morinosato%20Harushige">Takamichi</a>, who reached a highest rank of "<a href="j%C5%ABry%C5%8D">jūryō</a>" 9. 

Following Kagamisato's retirement the stable was taken over by the former "<a href="sekiwake">sekiwake</a>" <a href="Aonosato%20Sakari">Aonosato</a> who moved from the parent Tokitsukaze stable. He produced the "sekitori" <a href="Fukunosato">Fukunosato</a>, <a href="Shikishima">Shikishima</a>, <a href="J%C5%ABmonji%20Masayasu">Jūmonji</a> and <a href="Ry%C5%ABh%C5%8D%20Masayoshi">Ryūhō</a>. The stable folded upon Aonosato's retirement in November 2000 upon reaching 65 years of age, with the remaining wrestlers and personnel transferring to <a href="Michinoku%20stable">Michinoku stable</a>.

Re Peachdart Ltd

Re Peachdart Ltd [1984] Ch 131 is a judicial decision relating to <a href="Title%20retention%20clause">retention of title clauses</a>, and the extent to which the vendor of raw material can seek to assert title to good into which those raw materials are subsequently worked. The court held that seeking to assert title to the subsequently worked goods had the effect of creating an equitable charge, which was void for non-registration under the Companies Act.

Facts.
The company, Peachdart Ltd, carried on the business of manufacturing leather handbags. The company had granted a debenture to <a href="Barclays%20Bank">Barclays Bank</a> which contained a <a href="floating%20charge">floating charge</a> over all of the company's assets. That floating charge was duly registered under the <a href="Companies%20Act%201948">Companies Act 1948</a>.

Freudenberg Leather Co Ltd supplied substantially all of the leather used by the company. The leather was sold under contracts of sale which included a retention of title clause. That clause provided not only did title to the leather remain vested in Freudenberg after delivery up until they time that they were paid, but that Freudenberg could trace their title into any goods into which the leather was worked.

The company began to experience financial difficulties, and on 10 August 1981 Barclays Bank <a href="receivership">appointed receivers</a>. A dispute then arose as to which creditor had better title to the leather - Barclays Bank under the floating charge, or Freudenberg under the retention of title clause. The receivers challenged the clause on the basis that the power to trace title into subsequent products meant that the arrangement was effectively an equitable charge, which was <a href="void%20%28law%29">void</a> for non-registration.

Decision.
The case came before <a href="John%20Vinelott">Vinelott J</a>.

The parties acknowledged that these issues had come before the courts several times, most notably in the leading cases of "<a href="Aluminium%20Industrie%20Vaassen%20BV%20v%20Romalpa%20Aluminium%20Ltd">Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd</a>" [1976] 1 WLR 676, "<a href="Re%20Bond%20Worth%20Ltd">Re Bond Worth Ltd</a>" [1980] Ch 228 and "<a href="Borden%20%28UK%29%20Ltd%20v%20Scottish%20Timber%20Products%20Ltd">Borden (UK) Ltd v Scottish Timber Products Ltd</a>" [1981] Ch 25. However counsel for Freudenberg sought to distinguish those cases, arguing that in the case of a leather handbag, the leather was still readily identifiable. It had simply been cut and restitched, but clearly not been destroyed by the process.

Vinelott J rejected that argument. He held that at law the manufacturing process essentially created a new species of property, and that an attempt to trace title into that property took effect as an <a href="Security_interest%23Equitable_charge">equitable charge</a>, and accordingly, that provision in the contract of sale was void for non-registration under the mandatory statutory provisions applicable to company charges.

Authority.
The case is still accepted as authoritative today.

Qarnot computing is a French company offering High-Performance computing through a PaaS (Platform as a service) model on a distributed infrastructure made of hybrid computing-heating devices.

Company.
Qarnot computing was founded in 2010 and is based in Montrouge, France. The company raised €4.5M in two funding rounds closed in 2014 & 2016.

Products and technology.
Qarnot computing provides on-demand cloud computing, heating and smart home services based on the Q.rad, a wall-mounted radiator using embedded microprocessors as a heat source . The CPUs embedded in the Q.rad radiator heat up by processing compute-intensive tasks like financial simulations and 3D rendering. An aluminium heat sink dissipates the heat. Instead of using data centers, the computing capacity is dispatched in the form of heaters in buildings to reduce cost and carbon footprint .

Qarnot sells both Q.rads and on-demand cloud computing service. Connected to the Internet, the heaters form a decentralized network of computing nodes and the electricity consumed by every heater is refunded to the companies or individuals hosting them . Qarnot also provides Platform as a Service and Software as a Service to companies that require massive remote processing power, like banks and animation studios . .

In 2013, Qarnot installed 350 Q.rads in a social housing building in Paris, providing heating for 110 households .

In 2016, Qarnot presented a new version of the Q.rad and won the <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">CES</a> <a href="Popular%20Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a>’ Editors’ Choice Award in 2016 identifying the 10 most forward-thinking designs .

GT8

The three-part eight-axle <a href="Tram%23Articulated">articulated trams</a> used on <a href="Trams%20in%20Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg im Breisgau's tram</a> network are the GT8s. From 1971 to 1991, they were exclusively produced for the <a href="Freiburger%20Verkehrs%20AG">Freiburger Verkehrs AG</a> by the <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorfer%20Waggonfabrik">Düsseldorfer Waggonfabrik</a> in three series, which is why they are defined as "Typ Freiburg". They have been designed to be used <a href="Uni-directional%20vehicle">uni-directionally</a>. 

Construction.
The structural requirements of Freiburg made it necessary for their own tram type to be created. This was because conventional trams with <a href="Jacobs%20bogie">Jacobs bogies</a> were not suitable for the partially narrow curved radii. Freiburg's trams were based on the type used in Mannheim, also produced by Duewag and built from 1969. This was based on the classic Duewag articulate tram from 1956. In contrast to conventional articulated trams, however, the centre of gravity of Freiburg's trams were not the Jacobs bogies, but underneath the middle section, into which two tram end parts were attached. In addition to the all-axle drive, which was easier to implement, a better structure gauge was also used, totalling 34 metres of length.

After the twelve-axle tram were manufactured by the Rhein-Haardtbahn company, Freiburg's trams were regarded as the second longest tram car in the world. 

Series.
First Series (1971/72).
Between the years of 1971 and 1972, the Freiburger Verkehrs AG initially obtained four vehicles using so-called "Geamatic" controls. They were given operating numbers 201-204. Carriage 202 (externally distinguishable bu its central double head light) was the first to receive an automatic set point adjuster. From the outset, they were designed for travel without <a href="Conductor%20%28rail%29">conductors</a> and replacing some of the obsolete and personal-intensive vehicle-type sidecars from the early 1950s, which were still based on the War Tram Cars. 

They were originally equipped with a head light and cream lacquer. During the middle part of the 1980s, they were adjusted to normal trams and had two headlights installed, which were fitted to the central part next to each other. At the same time, they were repainted red and white in 1981.

In 2001, they were decommissioned for use in Freiburg. They were later used across <a href="Trams%20in%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">Łódź's tram network</a>, where they were served by Międzygminna Komunikacja Tramwajowa on line 46 to <a href="Ozork%C3%B3w">Ozorków</a>. Tram 2-4 was later scrapped during this period.

Second Series (1981/82).
After good experiences with the first four trams and the decision to expand the network, ten more trams were ordered towards the end of 1970s. These were commissioned in 1981 and 1982 and were given the numbers 205-214, also referred to as GT8K. They were lacquered in red and white and had two central front head lights. On journeys, there was no need for a conductor and the last type of trams with sidecars were discarded.

At a length of 2.32 metres, they are twelve centimetres wider than the trams from the first series, which in some curves of the network, required new track to be laid. An example of this was at the <a href="Schwabentor%20%28Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau%29">Schwabentor</a>. The larger width made it possible to make trams slightly bigger than the first series. Both storeys across the two series were very high, but were now accessible in the second series by means of three normal steps. The seats were also laid out 1+2 enabling more standing passengers to board the tram.

Instead of the mechanics of the first series, the second series used a <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> controller, which was operated via a set point transmitter. It enabled acceleration and deceleration to take place without jerking. In comparison to the first series, which had scissor <a href="Pantograph%20%28transport%29">pantographs</a>, the second series used single-armed pantographs.

Tram 205 is now used as an historic motor coach, tram 207 was scrapped in 2007 and trams 208 and 209 were sold to <a href="Trams%20in%20Ulm">Ulm's tram network</a>, where they were merged to form number 17 and used as a <a href="Bi-directional%20vehicle">bi-directional</a> <a href="Railgrinder">rail grinder</a>. From 2012, trams 206 and 210-214 were used full-time due to the refurbisment of the GT8Zs. Previously, they were only used during peak hours and for transporting spectators to <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a> home matches. Tram 206, which had already been marketed for sale, was now reactivated. In addition, they were all equipped with LED indicators. They are the only trams, alongside the Combinos, to have fitted LED indicators. The remaining trams were still being used until the completion of the GT8Z refurbishment and the delivery of the new <a href="Urbos">Urbos</a> in 2017.

Third Series (1990/91).
In 1990 and 1991, a further eleven motorised trams were obtained with numbers 221 to 231. In contrast to the second series, they were equipped with a <a href="Low-floor%20tram">low-floor</a> middle section. Because of their low-lever, they are also referred to as GT8N. Otherwise, they differ from their predecessor series by means of shear current pickups. They replaced the <a href="GT4%20%28Stuttgart%29">GT4</a>, now used in Stuttgart, in the short-term. All vehicles of this series were fitted with a <a href="dot-matrix%20display">dot-matrix display</a> in 2001 and run on lines 1, 3 and 5.

Oscar (bull)

Oscar #16 (d. 1983) was a <a href="ProRodeo%20Hall%20of%20Fame">ProRodeo Hall of Fame</a> <a href="bucking%20bull">bucking bull</a>. The ProRodeo Hall of Fame inducted Oscar in its 1979 inaugural class of inductees. To date, only seven bulls have received this honor, which is the highest honor a bucking bull can receive in the <a href="Professional%20Rodeo%20Cowboys%20Association">Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association</a> (PRCA). The <a href="California%20Rodeo%20Salinas">California Rodeo Salinas</a> inducted Oscar into its hall of fame in 2013. In over 300 attempts, only eight <a href="%20bull%20riding">bull riders</a> made qualified rides of the requisite eight seconds on Oscar. Eight-time world champion <a href="Bull%20riding">bull rider</a> <a href="Don%20Gay">Don Gay</a> made the highest-scored ride on him, earning 97 points, just 3 points short of a perfect score. Oscar's owners retired him in 1979 as a living exhibit to the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in <a href="Colorado%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Colorado Springs, Colorado</a>. He remained at the hall until his death in 1983.

Background.
Bob Barmby, a well-known innovator in breeding bulls and a stock contractor, bred and raised Oscar at his ranch in <a href="Lockeford%2C%20California">Lockeford, California</a>. Barmby named Oscar after his trainer and handler, Oscar Heard. According to an original owner of Rodeo Stock Contractors (RSC) and Barmby's son, Oscar's sire was Wirley Gig. Wirley Gig was himself a remarkable bull whom Barmby hauled and bucked. Even at the ranch, Oscar had a reputation for tossing cowboys in the dirt. He was a <a href="Brahman%20%28cattle%29">Brahma</a> bull who was gray in color.

Oscar was smaller in stature than most professional-level bucking bulls, weighing in at about . He was known for his violent spin to the left when first bucking. When he was a young bull, first beginning bucking, he attempted to hook dismounted riders with his horns. Later as he matured, he came to ignore them.

PRCA Career.
In 1972, Barmby sold his second rodeo string, including Oscar, to RSC. This was his final sale of bucking stock, and he retired from contracting.

Oscar bucked in the PRCA for his entire career, which began with RSC shortly after they bought him. For the first five years, over 100 bull riders attempted to get a qualified ride on him. Not one made the whistle at eight seconds. To sweeten the pot, RSC offered a bronze statue of Oscar to the first rider to obtain a qualified ride. 

In 1973, Oscar made his debut in a documentary film due to a challenge from a Mexican <a href="charro">charro</a> named Elias Arriolla. The documentary was a <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> film titled "<a href="The%20Great%20American%20Cowboy">The Great American Cowboy</a>." An attempt was made to handicap the bull by allowing Arriolla special privileges. Arriolla was permitted to use both hands (bull riding rules specify one hand) and he only needed to stay on for five seconds instead of the normal requirement of eight seconds. However, all was in vain as Oscar tossed him in less than two seconds. The entire venture only added to Oscar's reputation.

Finally, in 1975, John Davis succeeded in being the first bull rider to ride Oscar and win the bronze statue. Davis conquered Oscar in July of 1975 at the California Rodeo Salinas. Davis also won the championship gold buckle that day. Also in 1975, Randy Mager obtained one of his two rides from Oscar at the <a href="National%20Finals%20Rodeo">National Finals Rodeo</a> when he finished as the Reserve World Champion. Even after these rides, Oscar still was ridden very infrequently.

In 1977, Oscar's highest scored ride in his career came at the <a href="Grand%20National%20Rodeo">Grand National Rodeo</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco, California</a>, at the <a href="Cow%20Palace">Cow Palace</a>, when Don Gay rode him for 97 points, just 3 points short of a perfect score. The score was a record in the PRCA for any livestock ride (<a href="bronc%20riding">horse</a> or bull) at the time. The ride also won Gay the bull riding event and the bull riding world championship that year. Gay, an eight-time World Bull Riding Champion, ultimately managed to get three qualified rides on Oscar during the bull's career. Some of the few other bull riders that got a qualified ride on Oscar include Randy Magers, Jerome Robinson, Allan Jordan, and Guy Barth. Magers and Jordan each got qualified rides twice from Oscar. There is some conflict in the accounting of qualified rides; the ProRodeo Hall of Fame counts 10 qualified rides. Ultimately, only eight qualified rides are accounted in Oscar's career in the 300+ attempts taken. In 1978, Allen Jordan, a prominent judge for several bull riding circuits including the PRCA, <a href="Professional%20Bull%20Riders">Professional Bull Riders</a>, and the American Bucking Bull, Inc., won a challenge with the bull. He marked a high score of 96 on Oscar.It was not uncommon in those days for bull riders to fill in as judges and vice versa. "He was just so fast," remembers Jordan. "He was small enough that you could lose him."

Retirement and honors.
When RSC retired Oscar in 1979, he was sent to live at the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he spent his years in retirement as a living exhibit there until his death in 1983. Oscar became one of the most influential sires in breeding for Barmby, for many of the west coast's breeding operations, and for the American Bucking Bull, Inc., registry.

One of Oscar's sons, originally named Oscar II, Barmby later renamed Oscar's Velvet and branded him #34. Barmby sold Oscar's Velvet for $10,000 to Christensen Brothers Rodeo Company.This sale must have occurred at some point before 1972, at which time he had sold his second string, and liquidated his stock contracting business. At the time, that amount was unheard-of However, when Oscar's Velvet won the PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year,it more than paid off for the buyer. Oscar's Velvet went on to produce a line of sons that became notable bucking bulls. These included bulls such as Whitewater Skoal, a well-known breeding bull; Troubadour, a notable bucking bull; Reindeer Dippin', a notable bucking bull in his own right and father of the famed Bushwacker; and Trick or Treat, a PRCA Bull of the Year. Oscar is also great-great grandsire to <a href="Bushwacker%20%28bull%29">Bushwacker</a>, the : Brand of Honor bull.

The ProRodeo Hall of Fame inducted Oscar in its inaugural class in 1979. The California Rodeo Salinas inducted Oscar into its hall of fame in 2013. Oscar was inducted the same year as his then-owners, Bob and Nancy Cook, who owned RSC. Reminiscences of his career included comments from longtime rodeo announcer Wayne Brooks, who recalled, "He was about 1,400 pounds of the wildest fury you ever saw in your life. He had more life than the guys who rode him." Oscar bucked immediately out of the chute, making his already remarkable speed more challenging. "Usually when people tried to ride, they didn’t ride him for more than a jump or two," Bobbie Cook of RSC said. "He came out of the chute very quickly and kicked over his head."

The Reh Inscription of Menander is an inscription on a pillar discovered in <a href="Reh">Reh</a>, <a href="Fatehpur%20district">Fatehpur district</a>, <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, in the <a href="Ganges">Ganges valley</a> 96 km west of <a href="Kausambi">Kausambi</a> and 350 km south-east of <a href="Mathura">Mathura</a>, on the left bank of the <a href="Yamuna%20river">Yamuna river</a>. It is thought that it mentions the <a href="Indo-Greek">Indo-Greek</a> king <a href="Menander%20I">Menander I</a>. The inscription was first published by <a href="Allahabad%20University">Allahabad University</a> historian <a href="G.%20R.%20Sharma">G. R. Sharma</a> in 1980.

The inscription is in the Brahmi script, and is the only known inscription of Menander in northern India. The inscription, in original <a href="Prakrit">Prakrit</a> reads:

According to Sharma, the inscription is an exact and word-for-word translation of a Greek version:

<a href="Paleography">Paleographically</a>, the inscription is said to be early post-Mauryan, corresponding to the known dates of the reign of Menander.

In 2004, R.C. Senior also published a similar reading of the inscription, with an English translation:

The inscription tends to confirm that Menander was at the head of the Indo-Greek forays into northern India, probably reaching with his armies the capital city of <a href="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a>.

Some authors however have pointed that the reading of Menander is questionable. Others recognize the reading, but consider that the inscription is posthumous.

Destruction of Kausambi.
<a href="G.%20R.%20Sharma">G. R. Sharma</a> further conducted an archaeological survey in nearby <a href="Kausambi">Kausambi</a>, 96 kms to the east of the Reh inscription.

The survey showed that Kausambi had been completely destroyed at one point, and that the archaeological layer corresponding to the destruction contained numerous double-tanged and some triple-tanged arrows, consisting in an adaptation of Western socketed designs rather than Eastern designs, and previously associated with the Greeks in <a href="Taxila">Taxila</a>. These arrows can therefore be associated with the Indo-Greek invasion in the 2nd century BCE. Such arrowheads have also been found at Sonkh (near <a href="Borapa">Borapa</a>) and <a href="Mathura">Mathura</a>.

Similar destruction layers corresponding to the same time period were also found in <a href="Ujjain">Ujjain</a> and <a href="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a>, also suggesting destructions brought by the Indo-Greeks. Carbon dating confirmed the general time period of the destruction layers.

David Assarson

Berndt David Assarsson (born January 14, 1892 in Lund - died December 31, 1955 in Helsingborg) was a Swedish Catholic <a href="Priest">priest</a> in Helsingborg and Stockholm, <a href="Monsignor">monsignor</a>, historical author and psalmist. His efforts for the development of Roman Catholicism in Sweden were significant and in Denmark he is famous for his efforts for a reassessment of <a href="Sk%C3%A5neland">Skåneland</a>'s history.

Family Background and Career.
Assarsson was born in Lund in 1892 as the son of <a href="Professor">professor</a> of jurisprudence Pehr Assarsson and Gustafva Flensburg, and he was Lutheran Bishop Wilhelm Flensburg's grandson, as well as brother of Vilhelm Assarsson, a Swedish diplomat.

Assarsson became a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> at <a href="Lund%20University">Lund University</a> in 1912. He started to study <a href="Theology">theology</a> here and soon converted to Roman Catholicism in the same year and entered in the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> Order in Ordrup, Denmark. He studied further at the Jesuit Priest <a href="Seminary">Seminary</a> in <a href="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a> and was ordained priest in 1917. Assarsson then became a <a href="Chaplain">chaplain</a> at <a href="St.%20Eric%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Stockholm">Saint Eric Catholic Church</a> in Stockholm and became the bishop's secretary. He also remained in office after bishop Albert Bitter left and bishop Johannes Müller took over. In 1927 Assarsson was appointed permanent chaplain of the church and became in the same year a Chamberlain papal of nobility with the title of Monsignor. He was also the first priest church of Saint Clement's Catholic Church in Helsingborg.

Author and Editor.
He wrote the book of the Fathers Church: A program (1918), which was a missionary representation of Catholic faith and a backdrop of what he considered prejudices and mistakes in the Swedish public's assessments of it. The book title borrowed from a psalm from Lutheran bishop Johan Fredrik Eklund, but appealed specifically to the Catholic Church. In 1920 he agreed to start to edit the Catholic magazine Credo, and became its editor till 1937. He was later also involved in the Catholic Academic Association Academic Catholicum.

Assarsson was the editor of Psalms for the Church in 1937, the first attempt to make a Catholic hymn book related to the Swedish hymn tradition. In 1950, according to the same principles, he edited a new version of the Cecilia psalm book, which is the official hymn book of Stockholm's catholic poems (covering the whole of Sweden). He reaffirmed the English Cardinal <a href="John%20Henry%20Newman">John Henry Newman</a>'s Psalm in 1922, "Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom" to "Light, Light, Light, Dark World," which is also found in the <a href="Church%20of%20Sweden">Church of Sweden</a>'s hymn today.

Catholic activist.
During the controversy about the rather negative representation of the Catholic faith in Swedish school books, he wrote to the bishop Bitter in the back a Catholic schoolbook attachment that was distributed to public schools across the country. This initiative prompted a great resurrection in the Swedish press, and with few exceptions was rejected everywhere. It was argued that the Swedish schools had to remain confessional and found that the Swedish textbooks gave a confidently colored look of Catholicism. The polemic anti-Catholic newspapers on the occasion was the strongest since the 1890s; Even though the authorities rejected the Catholic views, it came from <a href="Swedish%20Social%20Democratic%20Party">Swedish Social Democratic Party</a>, some more comprehensible comments, and later published textbooks were somewhat muted in their characteristics.

He also committed himself to the Swedish ban on the creation of Catholic monasteries at the same time, referring to public statements about freedom of religion, and to Norway and Denmark admitted to such monasteries.

His other important works were The Skånska problem", published by Credos Förlag, Stockholm in 1923, "<a href="Sk%C3%A5neland">Skåneland</a>'s history in Skåneland's schools" in 1949, distributed by Killberg's Bookstore in Helsingborg. He was also editor of the Roman-Catholic Swedish-language Psalm Book Cecilia published in 1950.

Assarson also committed himself to the celebration of the Saint <a href="Ansgar">Ansgar</a>, which helped to strengthen the national roots of Swedish Catholicism. This happened several years before the Swedish Church start to celebrate Ansgarsfeiringen, which might be a reaction to the celebrations of this "Nordic apostle" by the Catholics as their own.

Historian.
In addition to his ecclesiastical work, Assarsson is also known for his efforts that <a href="Sk%C3%A5neland">Skåneland</a>en's history should be reproduced with focus on the Danish past of the region and the tough disappearance of the region after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Roskilde">Roskilde</a> peace in 1658. In his time, Swedish history books ignored the Danish past, the Skåne countries disappeared as unproblematic and did not mention Swedish attacks against the people of the country. Assarsson was appalled for his views in Swedish academic circles, but continued his lecture and writing. His main work became the Skåne problem (1923), emphasizing the importance of Skåne's history being considered in a Scandinavian perspective and taking into account the Danish background of the country. Subsequently, he published Skåneland's history in Skåneland's schools (1949), which was sent to all schools in the region as a supplement to the historically incorrect history of his opinion. Assarsson's efforts led to an increased interest in the Skåne country's Danish history and inspired later Swedish-critical historians within the Skåneland Movement.

Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument (Indianapolis)

The Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument (or Garfield Park Confederate Prisoner of War Monument) is a large <a href="granite">granite</a> monument that sits at the south entrance of <a href="Garfield%20Park%20%28Indianapolis%29">Garfield Park</a> in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> to commemorate the Confederate <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> that died at <a href="Camp%20Morton">Camp Morton</a>. At tall and located in the city's oldest public park, it is the most prominent of the very few Confederate memorials in the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> state of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>.

Background.
Shortly after the start of the Civil War, the original <a href="Indiana%20State%20Fair">Indiana State Fairgrounds</a> site in present-day <a href="Herron%E2%80%93Morton%20Place%20Historic%20District">Herron–Morton Place Historic District</a> was converted into a Union mustering ground and training camp known as Camp Morton. In 1862, the U.S. government assumed control of the camp and established a prison camp for Confederate soldiers. It quickly became one of the largest prison camps in operation; at its height in 1864, it housed nearly 5,000 prisoners. Due to poor conditions—which included overcrowding, lack of sanitation, malnutrition, disease, and lack of medical care—the mortality rate was high. By the end of the war, more than 1,700 prisoners had died at Camp Morton.

Origin and placement.
A small number of the Confederate dead from Camp Morton were identified and returned to their families after the war, but 1,616 soldiers were buried in a mass grave at <a href="Greenlawn%20Cemetery%20%28Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana%29">Greenlawn Cemetery</a>. It was here, in 1912, that the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument was first commissioned and placed by the U.S. federal government. However, with Greenlawn Cemetery set to close, the bodies and monument were later moved with the help of the Southern Club of Indianapolis. In 1928, the monument was separated from the grave and moved to its present location near an entrance of <a href="Garfield%20Park">Garfield Park</a>. The Confederate dead were reinterred, between 1928 and 1931, at a new plot known as the Confederate Mound in <a href="Crown%20Hill%20National%20Cemetery">Crown Hill National Cemetery</a>, with a small grave marker bearing no names.

Description.
The monument is located within a circular walking path north of Pagoda Drive, just within Garfield Park's south road entrance on East Southern Avenue. 

It is made of white granite, and measures tall and wide. On its north face, the granite shaft contains the following inscription: "ERECTED BY THE UNITED STATES TO MARK THE BURIAL PLACE OF 1616 CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS WHO DIED HERE WHILE PRISONERS OF WAR AND WHOSE GRAVES CANNOT NOW BE IDENTIFIED". Six wide bronze plates along the north and south sides of the base list the names and regiments of the dead.

Recent developments.
In the early 1990s, the local <a href="Sons%20of%20Confederate%20Veterans">Sons of Confederate Veterans</a> organization began lobbying federal officials to move the monument from Garfield Park to Crown Hill Cemetery to mark the actual Confederate grave site, which had no names listed. While ultimately unsuccessful in moving the monument, the effort resulted in a new memorial being installed in 1993 at Crown Hill's Confederate Mound that includes a all of the soldier's names and regiments on 10 new markers with bronze plaques.

In 2014, the local Sons of Confederate Veterans organization partnered with Indy Parks and the Indy Parks Foundation on a plan to restore the monument, which had fallen into disrepair. While some members expressed dissatisfaction with the monument, the Indy Parks board ultimately voted unanimously for the proposal to allow SCV to raise funds for the project on behalf of the Indy Parks Foundation.

In 2015, the Friends of Garfield Park, with funding from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust, launched a new audio tour throughout the park, which includes two soundbites discussing the monument. Vista markers shaped like <a href="phonograph">phonograph</a> speakers are at tour sites within the park, including one northwest of the monument.

In 2017, there was renewed public interest in the monument in the wake of the <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville</a> <a href="Unite%20the%20Right%20rally">Unite the Right rally</a> and the <a href="Removal%20of%20Confederate%20monuments%20and%20memorials">removal of Confederate monuments</a> in other cities. On August 17, <a href="Indianapolis%20City-County%20Council">City-County Council</a> President Maggie A. Lewis released a statement expressing a desire to start a conversation about the monument's location in Garfield Park. Monroe Gray, the Council's <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> majority leader, separately stated that he does not believe Garfield Park is an appropriate location, and noted that the monument "holds no historical significance to President <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">Garfield</a>," the park's namesake. Lewis and Mike McQuillen, Council's <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> minority leader, suggested an inventory of all public monuments in <a href="Marion%20County%2C%20Indiana">Marion County</a> be conducted, so there can be a better understanding of their content, and whether they might cause offense. Following councilors' remarks, the city's Department of Parks and Recreation stated that the monument was "not in a location appropriate for its original purpose," and that it intended to work with the Council and partners to "explore all available options to remove the monument from Garfield Park" so that it can be displayed in a setting that provides historical context.

On August 19, 2017, a man was reportedly arrested in the act of vandalizing the monument with a hammer.
