Doki River

The Doki River (土器川 "dokigawa") begins in the town of <a href="Mann%C5%8D%2C%20Kagawa">Mannō</a> (Kagawa Prefecture, <a href="Nakatado%20District%2C%20Kagawa">Nakatado District</a>) within the Asan Mountains and ends in the city of <a href="Marugame%2C%20Kagawa">Marugame</a>. It is the only <a href="Class%20A%20river">class a river</a> within <a href="Kagawa%20Prefecture">Kagawa Prefecture</a>. The river was named after Doki Village (土器村 "dokimura") which is presently known as the Doki vicinity or neighborhood within Marugame. Doki Village was located at the source of the river, and clay from there used to be taken and was made into earthenware goods. The Japanese word ""doki"" (土器) means “pottery” or “earthenware." The central portion or the river is called "haraikawa" (祓川) which is a river in which worshippers purify themselves before praying. The population around the river basin is around 35,000 people.

 Geography.
The source of Doki River is located on Mt. Ryuo (town of Mannō, Katsuura vicinity) in the <a href="Sanuki%20Mountains">Sanuki Mountains</a>. It flows north along <a href="Japan%20National%20Route%20348">Japan National Route 438</a> through the Marugame Plain until it reaches both the Northern Doki River and Fujimi Vicinities within Marugame where it merges into the <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Seto Inland Sea</a>. At times parts of the river dry up due to the dry climate in Kagawa and a man-made channel modification which shortened the river.

Notch (engineering)

A Notch in mechanical and materials engineering refers to a deliberately introduced v-shaped, u-shaped or circular defect in a planar material whereby stress is concentrated. Notch geometries play an important role in <a href="fracture%20mechanics">fracture mechanics</a> and <a href="materials%20characterisation">materials characterisation</a>. Notches are most often found in impact testing of materials where the presence of a crack origin of controlled morphology in necessary in order to achieve standardised characterisation of fracture toughness. This is most commonly realized using the <a href="Charpy%20impact%20test">Charpy impact test</a> , in which the impact of a pendulum hammer (striker) with a horizontal notched specimen and the height of its subsequent swing-through is used to infer the energy absorbed in fracture of the specimen. Impact testing of notched bars is also applied in the <a href="Izod%20impact%20strength%20test">Izod impact strength test</a>, typically applied to a cantilever configuration with a vertically positioned specimen. Charpy testing is conducting with U- or V-notches whereby the striker contacts the specimen directly behind the notch, whereas the now largely obsolete Izod method involves a circular notch facing the striker. Notched specimens find use in other characterization protocols, including tensile testing and fatigue.

Types of Notches.
V-Notch.
Sharp tipped V-shaped notches are often used in fracture toughness testing for materials of high ductility and for the characterisation of weld strength. 

Crack Repair.
Drilling a circular hole at the tip of a propagating crack can be used as a method for reducing crack tip stress concentration and preventing further propagation.

History.
Coyle was first mate aboard the "St. John", a fish-hauler <a href="Pink%20%28ship%29">pink</a> under Captain Benjamin Hartley. At <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a> they took aboard American John Richardson a new ship’s carpenter. Richardson had been a thief, con man, and womanizer. Together they conspired to take over the ship, and off <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> they staged a mutiny. They attacked Hartley with an axe, a <a href="blunderbuss">blunderbuss</a>, and even a feed trough, chasing him across the deck and through the rigging. Finally they threw him overboard where he clung to a rope until they hit him with an axe, causing him to fall into the sea and drown.

Coyle was elected captain of the "St. John" but was rebuffed by the crew when he proposed sailing for <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. Instead they sailed for <a href="Minorca">Minorca</a> before foul weather forced them to the <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> island of Foviniano. They lacked the proper paperwork to dock and were refused entry. Two boys on the ship took a boat to shore and informed the authorities, who sent out troops to apprehend Coyle and crew. Richardson and Coyle set sail before the troops arrived.

They headed for <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a>, where Richardson was arrested. He told the governor a story of being lost at sea; the governor believed him, put him up in a house, and have him some money. Richardson shared the money with Coyle, who got drunk and let slip the truth of their piracy. Coyle was arrested and sent to <a href="Marshalsea">Marshalsea</a> prison in <a href="London">London</a>. Richardson escaped, using cover stories to make his way to <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. There he was recognized by a captain who’d lived at Ancona and arrested.

Richardson was tried and convicted for Hartley’s murder and was executed. While awaiting his sentence he learned that Coyle had also been convicted and had been hung some months earlier. Coyle had tried to paint himself as an innocent man, victim of accidents and circumstances, but testimony from several other crewmen sealed his fate.

HEWI London

HEWI London is a global online marketplace, focusing on luxury and designer items for buying and selling. The company offers menswear, womenswear, children's clothing, bags, shoes and accessories, and targets the high fashion market. Memberships are available to everyone.

HEWI is an acronym of Hardly Ever Worn It, the company's former name. A re-brand was undertaken by Alan Aboud, previously of <a href="Zara">Zara</a> and <a href="ASOS">ASOS</a>.

History.
Beginning as a concept in 2009, Hardly Ever Worn It was formed in 2011 by Sharon Wolter-Ferguson. She was inspired by being asked by one of her friends "How much money is trapped in your wardrobe?". 
To grow the business, Wolter-Ferguson, with a group of investors including fund manager Artemis and advertiser Sir John Hegarty investing over £1 million, primarily in technology.

One year later, hardlyeverwornit.com was created and launched by Sharon, along with her two daughters, Natalya and Tatiana at their home in Marylebone, London. The site sold 600 of Sharon's own belongings to start, with subsequent years seeing it now sell £15 million worth of items, and having 17 people in employment at its base in Manchester Square, London.

October 2016 saw the company take on it's current guise as HEWI London, operating as Hardly Ever Worn It since 2012.

Financial.
Initially selling 600 of Sharon Wolter-Ferguson's own items, the company has a 76 per cent year-on-year growth rate, turning in over £4.5 million a year.

Press.
HEWI has received high levels of attention in the press in recent years. The Telegraph, Harpers Bazaar and The Daily Mail including the site in lists of 'best of' fashion resale sites, with El Pais naming it number one.
Sharon Wolter-Ferguson's person profile has also risen in recent years. Launching the company after divorcing and moving away from Monaco and back to London, she had zero business experience. Ultimately, she found herself setting up HEWI, and the rest is history.

Key figures.
Sharon Wolter-Ferguson is the CEO and Founder of HEWI. Advertising Consultant Sir John Hegarty acts as the company's Non-Executive Director, along with Stuart Higgins (PR Consultant and former newspaper editor), Richard Price and Simon Wickham also the company's Non-Executive Directors. Founder of lastminute.com and Moshi Monsters Tom Teichman acts as Chairman.

He is principally known for his flower and fruit still lifes. He collaborated with figure painters in the creation of allegorical and mythological scenes with an important still life element.
Life.
Little is known about the life of Jacob Melchior van Herck. His birth place and birth date are unknown. He was registered in the guild year 1691-1692 at the Antwerp <a href="Guild%20of%20Saint%20Luke">Guild of Saint Luke</a> as an apprentice of <a href="Gaspar%20Peeter%20Verbruggen%20the%20Younger">Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger</a>, a leading still life painter in Antwerp. Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger was also his half-brother or possibly, his brother-in-law. 

In the guild year 1694-1695 van Herck was registered as a master in the Antwerp Guild. In 1720 he became a deacon of the Guild, a position which he held for two years. He became a deacon again in 1734 and 1735. He is last mentioned in the records of the Guild in 1735.

Cornelis Moniaert was registered as his apprentice in the guild year 1698-1699.

It is not clear where or when he died but is must have been in or after 1735.

Work.
Jacob Melchior van Herck was a painter of flower and fruit still lifes. He regularly collaborated with figure painters in the creation of allegorical and mythological scenes, which incorporated important still life elements. His collaborators included <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Liberti">François Liberti</a> and possibly, <a href="Peter%20Ykens">Peter Ykens</a>. Several of these collaborations feature putti in an outdoor setting or allegorical figures. He also collaborated on portraits such as the (At Christie's, 13 December 2002, London, Lot 262). The portrait was likely painted by François Liberti while van Herck took care of the still life elements.

The compositions and motifs of van Herck were closely related to the opulent flower still lifes of his master Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger. His work is also regularly mixed up with that of his master's father <a href="Gaspar%20Peeter%20Verbruggen%20the%20Elder">Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Elder</a>.

Franjo Tomašić

Franjo Ksaver Tomašić was a Croatian <a href="baron">baron</a> and a <a href="Lieutenant%20Field%20Marshal">Lieutenant Field Marshal</a> of the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>'s Army who served as a First Governor of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Dalmatia">Kingdom of Dalmatia</a> between 1815 and 1831.

Early life and education.
Baron Franjo Ksaver Tomašić was born in a port-town of <a href="Rijeka">Rijeka</a> on October 2, 1761 in a noble Croatian family that is connected to the famous <a href="Mogorovi%C4%87%20%28nobility%29">Mogorović</a> family. At the age of 15, he entered the <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> "Army Academy of Engineering" from which he graduated as one of the most capable cadets. At the age of 20, Tomašić became a cadet at the Men's Choir. He soon became an officer and expressed his diligence in the construction of the <a href="Josefov%20Fortress">Josefov Fortress</a> in present-day <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>.

Career.
Tomašić demonstrated his courage for the first time in a war defending <a href="Le%20Quesnoy">Le Quesnoy</a> Fortress in 1793, in which he participated as a <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> of the Engineering Corps. During the conflict, Tomašić was captured by French who condemned him to death by a <a href="guillotine">guillotine</a>. He eventually survived thanks to the end of <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> and help by the Fortress commander, Colonel Beck who praised him before the emperor Francis II for his courage and merit.

In 1797, he was promoted to the rank of <a href="Major">Major</a> in the Engineering Corps and was, as a sign of special Emperors' confidence, appointed associate of the Austrian ambassador to the court of Russian Emperor <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul I</a> and has thus moved to the <a href="Petrograd">Petrograd</a>. However, he did not stay long on the position because he was given the command to join general <a href="Alexander%20Suvorov">Alexander Suvorov</a>s' units that Russia sent to Italy to assist France during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>. Tomašić was assigned to the corps of general <a href="Franz%20Seraph%20of%20Orsini-Rosenberg">Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg</a>, and had participated in all the events of the conflict.

In the 1800s, he demonstrated his heroism at a Fayle Hill. Namely, on April 11, in an attack on the Italian fortress Bochetto, Tomašić, in order to encourage his troops, stood at their forehead and had skillfully and bravely led them to the attack. However, he was almost mortally wounded through his chest. His wound was hard to heal and left him consequences of which he suffered for the rest of his life. On April 30, 1802, he was awarded the <a href="Military%20Order%20of%20Maria%20Theresa">Military Order of Maria Theresa</a> on the 68th promotion, and was promoted to the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a>, and afterwords <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a>. On July 29, 1808, he was given a title of the baron, which was also transferred to his younger brother Nikola, who was at the time army major, and later colonel.

At the time of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> in 1809, at the Siege of Palmanus', Tomašić was assigned to the main Austrian army headquarters and promoted to the rank of Major General on August 22. After French occupied parts of the Austrian Empire, from which they created <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Illyria%20%281816%E2%80%9349%29">Kingdom of Illyria</a>, he was named commander of <a href="Leopoldstadt">Leopoldstadt</a>, and become a member of a commission, led by general baron Knežević, that set new borders between France and Austria on the Croatian territory. After that, Tomašić became the commander of <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> which was at the time an important border point between Austrian and French territories.

During the 1813-14 <a href="War%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Coalition">War of the Sixth Coalition</a>, Tomašić was given a tough task to reclaim <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>. He had very few people and weak resources available. In October 1813, he started his campaign with 2,900 soldiers. On the night of October 29 to October 30, he occupied the lower part of the town of <a href="Knin">Knin</a> with one of the battalions composed of man from <a href="Lika">Lika</a> under the commend of colonel Popović, and called for French soldiers that barracked themselves in the <a href="Knin%20Fortress">Knin Fortress</a> to surrender. The Fortress was surrendered on October 31, and all soldiers in French service were allowed to leave freely. On November 3, he came with his units before the city of <a href="Zadar">Zadar</a>, the capital of Dalmatia, which was defended by French general César Antoine Roize. After weeks of fighting, general Roize proclaimed capitulation on December 6. On December 15, Tomašić sent his adjutant, general Bogdan Milutinović with two battalions and one additional troop to reclaim <a href="Kotor">Kotor</a>, <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a> and <a href="Fort%20Norin">Fort Norin</a>. The campaign was successful. He eventually expelled all the French troops led by three generals from Dalmatia and sent them as prisoners of war to Italy.

On December 26, 1813, Tomašić was awarded <a href="Order%20of%20Leopold%20%28Austria%29">Order of Leopold</a>, promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Field Marshal, and appointed provisional governor of Dalmatia (which included <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a>, <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bay of Kotor</a> and parts of <a href="Albania">Albania</a> as well). In 1816, Emperor named him the second owner of the 22nd Infantry Regiment of <a href="Leopold%2C%20Prince%20of%20Salerno">Prince Leopold Sicilian</a>.

Baron Tomašić died in Zadar on August 12, 1831, not receiving the last confession by the Emperor, who awarded him the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Iron%20Crown%20%28Austria%29">Order of the Iron Crown</a> shortly before his death.

<doc id="54731308" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54731308" title="Hofstatt">
Hofstatt

The Hofstatt is a <a href="shopping%20mall">shopping mall</a> that opened in 2013 in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>'s old town. The core of the building is the former site of the <a href="S%C3%BCddeutscher%20Verlag">Süddeutscher Verlag</a>, whose historical edifices are part of the design by architect <a href="Max%20Littmann">Max Littmann</a> on the <a href="Sendlinger%20Stra%C3%9Fe">Sendlinger Straße</a> and the brick printing press building was also incorporated into the project.

Under the name of Hofstatt, which originates from a main road, almost the entire road block was developed between Sendlinger Straße, Färbergraben, Hotterstraße and Hackenstraße. Apart from the commercial buildings, it also includes residential buildings on Hotterstrasse and Hackenstraße and is grouped around several inner courtyards.

Shopping mall.
The Hofstatt opened in April 2013 on an area between Sendlinger Straße, Hackenstraße and Färbergraben. It covers 15,500 m² of <a href="fashion">fashion</a> and furnishing stores as well as gastronomic establishments and 18,000 m² of <a href="office">office</a> space as well as 69 apartments. Similar to other shopping malls (for example, <a href="F%C3%BCnf%20H%C3%B6fe">Fünf Höfe</a>, <a href="Karlsplatz%20%28Stachus%29">Stachus-Passage</a> or Kaufingertor-Passage), it is close to the central Munich intercity junctions between <a href="Marienplatz">Marienplatz</a> and <a href="Sendlinger%20Tor">Sendlinger Tor</a>.

Architecture.
The three-armed shopping mall connects Marcel Meili's new building, completed in 2013, with a partly <a href="Cultural%20heritage%20management">protected historical</a> portion. This way, the 1905/06 facade designed by Max Littmann, was used for the 1945-2008 editorial building of the Süddeutsche Zeitung and then the completely emptied core of the building was integrated. A central point is the "Lichthof", which owes its name to a glass dome, which had covered the printing building of the <a href="S%C3%BCddeutsche%20Zeitung">Süddeutsche Zeitung</a>. On the curved passages, <a href="Display%20window">shop windows</a> made of curved glass panes, are to be seen.

The previously inaccessible inner courtyards of the site have been open to the public since the reopening.

There are offices in the upper floors of the commercial buildings. With the shopping mall, apartments were also built on the property, but in separate buildings on Hofstatt street and the corner of Färbergraben.

Economical.
The building was erected by the real estate agency of <a href="Landesbank%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Landesbank Baden-Württemberg</a> and the American real estate company <a href="Hines%20Interests%20Limited%20Partnership">Hines Interests Limited Partnership</a> and was acquired by Quantum Immobilien AG after its opening at the end of 2013, and who has marketed it since then and acts as the owner's representative. The purchase price was around 400 million euros.

The originally planned completion date at the end of 2010 could not be sustained, among other things, due to the elimination of contaminated sites (residues of the former <a href="Printer%20%28publishing%29">printer</a>s of the Süddeutsche newspaper) and financing questions.

<a href="Anchor%20store">Permanent renter</a> is <a href="Abercrombie%20%26amp%3B%20Fitch">Abercrombie & Fitch</a>, which operates one of eight of its German branches at Sendlinger Straße 8.

Regent, Royal and Carlton Terrace Garden

The Regent, Royal and Carlton Terrace Garden (previously known as the Carlton Hill Pleasure Ground, the Large Garden and Regent Gardens) is a private communal garden in the <a href="New%20Town%2C%20Edinburgh">New Town</a> area of <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="EH%20postcode%20area">EH7</a>. The garden lies over a sized site on the east side of <a href="Calton%20Hill">Calton Hill</a>. The garden has been listed on the <a href="Inventory%20of%20Gardens%20and%20Designed%20Landscapes">Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes</a> as part of the New Town gardens heritage designation since March 2001.

The garden cannot be publicly seen except from the properties adjacent to it. The garden is the largest of the gardens in Edinburgh's New Town that are still in private ownership; they are managed by the Regent Royal and Carlton Terrace Gardens Association. The garden has occasionally been publicly accessible through the annual Doors Open Days scheme.

The management of the garden is governed by a <a href="Local%20and%20personal%20Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Local Act of Parliament</a>, the Regent, Royal and Carlton Terrace Gardens, Edinburgh Order Confirmation Act 1970, which received <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> in May 1970.

Design and history.
The Regent, Royal and Carlton Terrace Garden forms a triangular plot bordered by the individual domestic gardens of Regent Terrace and Carlton Terrace.

The garden was created between 1830 and 1832; the <a href="Feu%20%28land%20tenure%29">feu</a> having been granted after an agreement that the ground be used for pleasure gardens. The garden was laid out with the help of the naturalist and gardener, <a href="Patrick%20Neill%20%28naturalist%29">Patrick Neill</a>, and botanist <a href="Robert%20Graham%20%28botanist%29">Robert Graham</a>, the <a href="Regius%20Keeper%20of%20the%20Royal%20Botanic%20Garden">Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden</a>. The layout of the garden has remained largely unchanged since its inception.

The layout of the garden is broadly divided into a large 7 acre lawn area and a smaller 5 acre woodland area. The lawn area is planted with several different species of trees with a terrace of lime trees set near a <a href="ha-ha">ha-ha</a> near the Calton Hill boundary wall at the top of the garden. Various paths covered by trees surround the large lawn area. The woodland area is planted with crocuses, daffodils and bluebells. A survey of the trees in the garden in 1984 recorded several species including cherry, sycamore, black poplar and sweet chestnut trees.

Two tennis courts were laid in the north west part of the garden between 1882 and 1883; these were replaced by a more permanent court in 1889.

The journalist and editor Arnold Kemp wrote of his experiences serving on the committee in the 1970s in a 1993 article for the "<a href="Glasgow%20Herald">Glasgow Herald</a>".

Cameroon Press Photo Archive

The Cameroon Press Photo Archive (CPPA-B) is a photographic archive located in <a href="Buea">Buea</a>, the regional capital of the <a href="Southwest%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">South West Region</a> of <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>. It holds around 120,000 negatives and 14,000 proof sheets (templates on which up to 16 contact prints were mounted for the purpose of reference) in total, granting an impressive view of Anglophone Cameroon’s history for the time period 1955 to 2000. Between 2013 and 2015 <a href="http%3A//www.african-photography-initiatives.org">African Photography Initiatives</a> digitized 25,000 negatives and all 14,000 proof sheets. A copy of the digitized material is in the possession of the Ministry of Communication, the authority in charge of the photo archive. The CPPA-B is considered an endangered archive.

History.
The CPPA-B was founded in 1954 by the British colonial administration when Southern Cameroons was granted quasi regional status and started operating in November 1955. The person responsible for the setting up of the archives (more precisely the Photo Section within the Southern Cameroons Information Service) was <a href="Emmanuel%20Moanga%20Mbwaye%20%281928-2016%29">Emmanuel Moanga Mbwaye (1928-2016)</a> who had trained as a photographer in the Colonial Film Unit while working with the Cameroon Development Cooperation (C.D.C.) which had been formed in 1947 with the objective of developing and running plantations of tropical crops in Cameroon. Mbwaye worked alone from the early years but joined in 1961 by Scott Fominyam. The latter was an assistant-photographer to Mbwaye and, in 1974, was transferred to Bamenda to set up the North West regional office of the Photographic Section. Mbwaye was frequently sent out of office to cover events. Scheduling clashes meant he was unable to effectively do the work alone and this necessitated the contracting of studio photographers such as Batanwi Photos (South West in Victoria now <a href="Limbe%2C%20Cameroon">Limbe</a>) and CC Sports (North West in <a href="Bamenda">Bamenda</a>). The mandate of the photographers of the Press Photo Agency was to follow any governmental or otherwise socially relevant events throughout its territory (today’s Northwest and Southwest Regions).

The activities of the Photographic Section continued after 1961 when it became the West Cameroon Photographic Section (part of the Federal Republic) and thereafter, under the United Republic of Cameroon (formed after a referendum in 1972). The photographers working for the Information Service produced not only photographs but also movies, which were subsequently shown by mobile cinemas units in rural and urban areas all over the territory. These movies' primary purpose was the information and education of the population about matters such as health, hygiene or the importance of schooling. These photographers were also responsible for covering the Presidents’ and Prime Minister’s activities as well as any official events of public interest. From its inception and through the 1980s the Photographic Division was active and able to preside directly over all the phases of photo production, from shooting to development and print.

The first photographer of the Information Service, Emmanuel Moanga Mbwaye, retired in 1987 after being transferred to the Cinematography Division in 1983. Until his retirement, the Photographic Division was well-staffed overall: one librarian, several photographers and two persons in the darkroom worked there full-time. None of these were replaced after retirement. As a result, the photographic archives have been left with progressively fewer staff and remained practically abandoned at the beginning of 2001, when the last photographer retired.

Since 2001, the CPPA-B has been permanently closed. Under such conditions, photographic archives are at constant risk as they are exposed to <a href="Conservation%20and%20restoration%20of%20photographs%23Types%20and%20Causes%20of%20Deterioration">factors of deterioration</a> such as humidity, termite infestation and <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a>.

Premises.
The premises of the CPPA-B is part of the old administrative centre of Buea Town and located in an old wooden colonial building. The administrative organ responsible for the management of the CPPA-B is the Ministry of Communication whose Regional Delegation’s office is nearby. The building next to the CPPA-B hosts the National Archives Buea, which is under the authority of the Ministry of Arts and Culture. With the abolition of the Federal system in 1975, <a href="National%20Archives%20of%20Cameroon">Cameroon's national archives</a> were centralised in <a href="Yaound%C3%A9">Yaoundé</a>, the capital of the United Republic of Cameroon. The photographs (negatives, <a href="contact%20print">contact print</a>s and proof sheets) which are kept in the CPPA-B cover the years from November 1955 to 2000. With the retirement of the last photographer who worked in that service in 2001, the CPPA-B was locked down and abandoned. Some renovations of the exterior were carried out on the building just a few days before the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Anglophone and Francophone Cameroon in February 2014. Inside the building itself, however, nothing was done. In its present state, the CPPA-B lacks the building integrity, security, fire protection, and air quality control that are basic requirements for a long-term archive.

Contents.
Due to the rigorous system of archiving put in place by the British administration in the mid-50s, which was maintained by the archive's librarian, Martha Mosinga, after independence, the contents of the CPPA-B are in relatively good shape. However, under the present climatic conditions the holdings are jeopardised by high humidity and temperatures. The Archives contain approximately 120,000 negatives, 14,000 proof sheets (templates on which up to 16 contact prints were mounted for the purpose of reference) and 12 register books. Generally, approximately 500 negatives that are packed in paper envelopes are stored in small wooden boxes. Some of the negatives in the CPPA-B present visual evidence of events such as, among many others, the Governor General’s tour of the Southern Cameroons in December 1957, the Premier’s arrival from the UNO Conference in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on 16 March 1959, United Nations Secretary General <a href="Dag%20Hammarskj%C3%B6ld">Dag Hammarskjöld</a>’s arrival at <a href="Tiko%20Airport">Tiko airport</a> from Yaoundé, views of Victoria’s Barclays Bank building, and the Commonwealth Youth Sunday Celebrations in Buea and Victoria.

Access.
To gain access to the Press Photo Archives in Buea one is required to write an application to the corresponding authorities. There are no hard copies of photographic prints as the archives contain only negatives and proof sheets. There is no equipment to print the negatives. It is also difficult to access the material that was <a href="digitization">digitised</a> by <a href="http%3A//african-photography-initiatives.org">African Photography Initiatives</a> with support from the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>’s Endangered Archives Program and the Swiss <a href="Federal%20Office%20of%20Culture">Federal Office of Culture</a>. With the support of a team six Cameroonians and in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication between 2013 and 2015, over 25,000 negatives and 14,000 proof sheets were digitised, a database established and conservation measures carried out. There is a pending offer of the British Library to make the digitised material available on their website but permission by the Ministry of Communication had not been granted by early 2017. <a href="University%20of%20Bamenda">Bamenda</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Buea">Buea</a> Universities have requested copies but no permission for this was yet forthcoming.

This impasse resulted in the Yaoundé Declaration of November 9, 2016 through which African Photography Initiatives and other subscribers intended to generate a greater understanding of the value of photographs and films and analogue as well as digital archives for the studies in historic, human and social sciences. The declaration calls on the government and other stakeholders in Cameroon to make every effort in order to protect and make accessible for public use the country’s photographic and cinematographic heritage. As a first step, the Yaoundé Declaration recommends the recognition of the CPPA-B and the National Photo Library Yaoundé as cultural property as intended in the law on Cultural Heritage in Cameroon from 18 April 2013.

She notes that "one nevertheless feels in filigree a permanent conviction, a sincerity without fault and a completely refreshing commitment ".

Biography.
Richard Baker was born in Chicago on May 2, 1916. He began playing piano at two-and-a-half years of age By age four he was playing piano for his mother at musical engagements. He attended high school at <a href="J.%20Sterling%20Morton%20High%20School%20District%20201">Morton</a> and <a href="Fenger%20Academy%20High%20School%20%28Chicago%29">Fenger</a> in Chicago, where he was known to cut classes for musical opportunities. He joined a local 12-piece band, and had occasional gigs as a pianist, master of ceremonies, and singer. He met his wife when he was 20 years old, and married her shortly afterwards.

His full-time professional entertaining career began in 1938, playing for night clubs with notable dates at the <a href="Chicago%20Theater">Chicago Theater</a> and the <a href="Riverside%20Theater%20%28Milwaukee%29">Riverside</a> in Milwaukee.

It was early in his radio career that he was given the entertainment name "Two Ton" by a fellow radio-station employee. He quit WJJD in 1943 and concentrated on his nightclub work, but he was given his own radio show entitled "One Man Show" on station <a href="WGN%20%28AM%29">WGN</a> in 1944. For the next several years Baker was closely associated with that station, and vice-versa.

The next day was WGN's first full day of programming which included Baker's show "Wonder House", a puppet program hosted in conjunction with Art Nelson. "Wonder House" was aired five days a week at 7:30PM. The program featured a marionette made to look like Baker, named "Half-Ton". The show was one of the most popular early television shows in Chicago, and it was stated that Baker was "made for TV". The show was praised for Baker's performances and a well-placed set, but it suffered from poor script writing and microphone placement. Although drawing an adult audience as well as the children it was aimed at, "Wonder House" was cancelled after five months because of the excessive production costs. Baker gained national radio exposure when "The Two Ton Baker Show", originating from WGN, was carried across the Mutual network.

His recordings on Heartbeat were released as late as 1973. Baker's final employment was at Mangam’s Chateau where he was engaged for five nights each week.

Robert Ray (artist)

Robert Ray (October 24, 1924 – March 29, 2002) was an <a href="American%20people">American</a> artist, active in the middle to late twentieth century.

Early life, travel and education.
Robert Donald Ray was born in <a href="Denver%2C%20Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a> in 1924; one of two sons raised by Irene and Carl J. Ray, Sr. Ray graduated from Denver East High School and enrolled at <a href="Drake%20University">Drake University</a>. His studies were interrupted by <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, during which he enlisted in the Navy, serving in South Pacific and Japan. After the war, he completed his studies in visual art at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> in Los Angeles, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1950. He then received a <a href="Master%20of%20Fine%20Arts">MFA</a> degree from the <a href="Centro%20de%20Estudios%20Universitarios">Centro de Estudios Universitarios</a> in 1952.. Following graduation, and travel to Europe, Ray moved to Taos in 1954.

Work.
Over the course of his career, Ray worked in a wide variety of media. In 1968, Ray’s work was described by Robert A. Ewing, former curator of <a href="New%20Mexico%20Museum%20of%20Art">Fine Arts Museum</a> of <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a> in the following words: “There is in his work the magic of a court jeweler working with materials of our time. Whether it be the masterfully controlled intricacy of drawing or the compelling power of sculpture in which one discovers surprises from the natural world in combination with elements as unexpected as shattered glass, there is a delight and timelessness in the Southwestern Odyssey of Robert Ray.” 

As stated by Phaedra Greenwood in a review of a retrospective show near the conclusion of Ray’s life: “Rarely has a one-person show displayed such a range in wood, metal, glass and oil on linen, timeless abstracts polished to a gem like finish. He’s a minimalist of the highest order; nothing is wasted or overdone. Each piece is a classic statement of elegance, tension and pure essence.”

Ray’s early work consisted of graphite, ink, wood-cut prints and oil, and ranged from portraits to abstract prints to still-life and semi-representational landscapes. Shortly after arriving to Taos in 1954, Eulalia Emetaz invited Ray to show in her Galeria Escondida (The Hidden Gallery) in Taos, which led to a two-year residency grant from the Wurlitzer Foundation, 1954-1956.” During this time, Ray painted numerous portraits including "The Honorable Dorothy Brett" which helped Ray to establish a local following. “[A]fter I did Dorothy Brett’s portrait, others wanted one, I’m sorry that Frieda Lawrence died just before I was going to paint her. And Georgia (O’Keefe) couldn’t sit still long enough; she was better suited to photography”. 

Writing in "Prize Winning Oil Paintings and Why they Won the Prize", author Margaret Harold quotes David Gebhard, director of the <a href="Roswell%2C%20New%20Mexico">Roswell</a> Museum and Art Center:
"Ray represents an interesting case in current American painting, in that he generally retains reference to subject matter, although he is by no means a representational painter... [H]is major asset is in his tactile quality, and the subtle aspect of his color. These two aspects are combined together to produce a really 'Classic' quality in all of his painting which I have experienced."

Ray earned his first award in “The Midwest Third Biennial Exhibition” held at the Joslyn Art Museum, 1954. This showing was followed by awards in Brooklyn, New York; Dallas, Texas; Columbia, South Carolina; and the Museum of New Mexico. In 1959 Mr. Ray was selected in “Painting - New Talent in the U.S.A.” by the magazine "Art in America". Ray also maintains the distinction of being the only artist to exhibit in each of the “Taos Moderns” annual exhibitions held. In 1961, Ray was described locally as “one of the outstanding young artists in America today,” and in 1964, Ray exhibited artwork in the Southwestern America presentation at the World’s Fair in New York. Ray won further recognition in 1969 for sculpture (Wood & Glass), and 1972 in graphics.

In 1961, Ray stated his view on art sales:
"the best method [to determine art pricing] is through auction, except for a living artist’s works; the contemporaries must sell through supply and demand.”

Having established a strong reputation in the 1950s and 1960s, Ray shifted focus to his role as an artisan and citizen of Taos, serving on “just about every art related board in Taos that ever existed.” As summarized by Robert Ellis, Harwood Museum Director, in a 2000 retrospective:
"Robert Ray, since arriving in Taos in 1954, has played a vital role both as an artist and as a resident. Over the years the Taos community and the Harwood have benefitted from Bob’s many years of service on the non-profit boards that include the Little Theater Board (he also designed stage sets), The Taos Art Association, Taos Public Library, and the Taos School of Music (currently)".

Following retrospective shows in 1999 and 2000, Ray resumed a prolific pace of painting, creating numerous series of representational and abstract watercolors prior to his death in 2002.

Ray's work was included in an exhibition along with Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, many of the Taos Moderns and other notable Taos artists in a show produced in part, by Dennis Hopper. The show was titled “Taos collects the Modern since 1900”.

Eight of the Taos Moderns created works selected by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) for use in a traveling exhibition that accompanied a graduate recruiting campaign in the early 1960s. The approach was unique: “LASL is a pioneer in the use of contemporary art in recruiting ads and is perhaps the first to use finished line art for that purpose.” The art from the show was used in the LASL recruiting booth at the National Science Convention, included in the LASL publication “A-R-T Spells Science” and selected on basis that the art “fit an idea LASL wanted to express.”

Helen Huntington Hull

Helen Huntington Hull (April 9, 1893, <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, New York - December 11, 1976, <a href="Staatsburg">Staatsburg</a>, New York) was an American socialite, patron of the arts and political hostess.

Early life.
Helen Dinsmore Huntington was born on April 9, 1893, to Helen Gray Dinsmore (1868-1942) and <a href="Bob%20Huntington">Robert Palmer Huntington</a> (1869-1949), an independently wealthy architect and tennis champion. She had one brother, Robert Huntington Jr, and a sister, Alice Huntington Juta (1898-1966). Helen Huntington grew up in <a href="Rhinebeck%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Rhinebeck</a>, New York, at both her paternal mansion, Hopeland House, designed by her own father, and maternal mansion, Staatsburg on Hudson.

Huntington attended schools in <a href="Dobbs%20Ferry%2C%20New%20York">Dobbs Ferry, New York</a>.

Marriages.
On April 30, 1914, Huntington, age 21, married <a href="Vincent%20Astor">William Vincent Astor</a> (1891-1959), son of Lt.-Col. <a href="John%20Jacob%20Astor%20IV">John Jacob Astor IV</a> and <a href="Ava%20Lowle%20Willing">Ava Lowle Willing</a>; they knew each other since they were children; the Astor family mansion, Ferncliff, was just a few miles from Bob Huntington's property at Staatsburg, Hopeland House, a thirty-five room Tudor Revival mansion.

The press described Huntington as "a charming American girl". Huntington asked Astor to choose as their main residence the Hudson Valley mansion, Ferncliff, because she did not care for society life. The wedding took place at Hopeland House and the nearby little country church. After the marriage, they went on a cruise on the <a href="USS%20Noma%20%28SP-131%29">Noma</a>, Vincent Astor's yacht that was later loaned to the U.S. Army during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

On April 15, 1941, Huntington married Lytle Hull (1882-1958), a real estate broker and an old friend of Vincent Astor.

Career.
As a patron of arts.
Huntington was a lover of music and opera (she attended her first opera when she was two) and therefore helped to found the New York City Center and the New York Opera Company. She was a patron of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> on Broadway Street. She owned two boxes, one she used herself and one she kept for her guests. In 1966 she was among those who attended the closing gala at the Met on Broadway Street, and helped found its re-opening at the <a href="Lincoln%20Center">Lincoln Center</a>. She attended the inauguration gala night at <a href="David%20Geffen%20Hall">The Philharmonic Hall</a>, directed by her friend <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>.

Huntington was on the board of directors of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Ballet">New York City Ballet</a>, The Metropolitan Opera, the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a> and the <a href="Lincoln%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</a>. She was a trustee of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. She created the Musicians' Emergency Fund to support musicians, creating teaching and performing jobs.

Also an accomplished piano-player, in 1942 Huntington performed at the <a href="Poughkeepsie%20High%20School">Poughkeepsie High School</a> in the presence of <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a>. This was her only public performance. After that, she continued to play into her 70s, often with her Locust-on-Hudson's neighbor, pianist <a href="Rudolf%20Firku%C5%A1n%C3%BD">Rudolf Firkušný</a>.

"Among the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California" is a 1868 oil painting by <a href="Albert%20Bierstadt">Albert Bierstadt</a>. It was acquired in 1873 by William Brown Dinsmore, Huntington's grandfather; when Huntington inherited the painting, she had it directly glued to a wall of the second floor of her new mansion, Locust-on-Hudson. When she died in 1976, she bequeathed the painting to the <a href="Smithsonian%20American%20Art%20Museum">Smithsonian American Art Museum</a>.

Huntington was a good friend of <a href="Elsa%20Maxwell">Elsa Maxwell</a>, <a href="Cole%20Porter">Cole Porter</a>, <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> and <a href="Maury%20Henry%20Biddle%20Paul">Maury Henry Biddle Paul</a> aka <a href="Cholly%20Knickerbocker">Cholly Knickerbocker</a>.

Political hostess.
In 1941 Huntington inherited Staatsburg on Hudson from her maternal grandfather, William Brown Dinsmore II, head of Adams Express Company, a railroad and shipping concern. She demolished the previous mansion to build a much lighter house, <a href="Locusts%20on%20Hudson">Locusts on Hudson</a>, designed by architect John Churchill in the Neobaroque style. At Locust on Hudson, she held her gala fundraising events and raised her six dogs. At Hopeland House, she hosted her political fundraising events, attended by the likes of <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> and <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>.

The <a href="Huntington%20family">Huntington family</a> had deep roots in politics; Huntington's relatives includes: <a href="Elisha%20Mills%20Huntington">Elisha Mills Huntington</a>, Indiana State Representative 1832-1836, Indiana Circuit Court Judge 1837-1841, Judge of the U.S. District Court of Indiana 1842-1862, delegate to the Democratic National Convention 186; Nathaniel Huntington, Indiana State Representative 1827-1828; James Huntington, member of New York state senate 25th District, 1856–57; <a href="Samuel%20Huntington%20%28Connecticut%20politician%29">Samuel Huntington</a>, Connecticut Superior Court Judge 1773-1785, Delegate to the Continental Congress from Connecticut 1776-1784, Deputy Governor of Connecticut 1784-1786, Governor of Connecticut 1786-1796; <a href="Samuel%20H.%20Huntington">Samuel H.

They are among the founders of <a href="Huntington%2C%20Indiana">Huntington, Indiana</a>, and for this reason, the town paid a tribute to the memory of its founder by sending a handsome cedar chest to Helen Dinsmore Huntington in occasion of her wedding to Vincent Astor.

When, in 1913, Vincent Astor was asked if his future wife, Helen Huntington, believed in suffrage for women, he replied that she was far too sensible for that.

Blagaj Castle

Blagaj ( is a <a href="medieval">medieval</a> ruined castle located on the right bank of the <a href="Korana">Korana</a> river in modern <a href="Karlovac%20county">Karlovac county</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>. Around it formed an eponymous village, <a href="Blagaj%2C%20Croatia">Blagaj</a>. It has a rectangular floorplan, and was once one of the larger castles in the region, with a central tower, similar to <a href="Belaj%20castle%2C%20Karlovac%20county">Belaj</a>, <a href="Karlovac%20county">Karlovac county</a>. The old parish church of Sv. Duh is proposed to have been situated not far from the ruins, where there are today two churches next to each other.

Geography.
The castle shares its name with several others in the <a href="Dinaric%20Alps">Dinaric area</a>. One is <a href="Blagaj%20Castle%20%28Sana%29">Blagaj</a> on the <a href="Sana%20%28river%29">Sana</a> in modern <a href="Bosnia">Bosnia</a>. The other is Blagaj Fort on the <a href="Buna%20%28Neretva%29">Buna</a>, also in Bosnia
Blagaj is a castle of the <a href="Kordun">Kordun</a> region, a low karst plateau. The Korana river cuts through the Kordun, flowing from its source at the beginning of the <a href="Plitvice%20Lakes%20National%20Park">Plitvice lakes</a> to its confluence with the river <a href="Kupa">Kupa</a>.

Several notable ruins of other objects lie in the vicinity of the ruined castle. An hour's walk in the direction of Veljun on the Korana is the church of Sv. Ivan. Also nearby are the ruins of the castle (mentioned in 1500) and parish church (mentioned 1334, 1501) of Stojmerić, over the hill to the east. On the left bank of the Korana, opposite the castle, are the remains of the parish church of Sv. Kuzma i Damjan in Hrapavci (mentioned 1334, 1501). The Turks destroyed all these older churches in <a href="Ottoman%20wars%20in%20Europe">their invasions</a>.

The ruins can be difficult to find, but they are open to the public. The surrounding region is completely free of landmines, according to the interactive map on the website of the Croatian Mine Action Centre, as accessed July 2017.

History.
At the time of the first mention of Blagaj, it was owned by the Babonić family, who presumably built it, naming it after Blagaj on the Sana, which they had built in 1240. At the time, Blagaj on the Korana was usually called Blagaj Turanj. In 1266, the lords Petar, Matija, and Kristan Babonić, sons of Roland, <a href="Ban%20of%20Croatia">Ban of Croatia</a>, received the lands on the right bank of the Korana around Stojmerić, in exchange for a portion of their Vodička županija by the <a href="Una%20%28Sava%29">Una</a> by <a href="Hrvatska%20Kostajnica">Kostajnica</a>, giving up the ban's lands in Žirovac, Bojna, and Stojmerić.

After this, there is no information on the castle of Blagaj, nor on its dependents, Stojmerić, and Hrapavci around Kuzma (mentioned 1273 as a possession of Stijepan and Radoslav), until the XV century. In Blagaj, the new parish of Sv. Duh was formed, which survived the Turkish raids until at least 1574. The lords of Blagaj lived mostly in <a href="Ozalj">Ozalj</a>, <a href="Steni%C4%8Dnjak">Steničnjak</a>, <a href="Zrin%20Castle">Zrin</a>, and <a href="Ostro%C5%BEac%20Castle">Ostrožac</a>. In the XV. century, they lived mostly in the castle of <a href="Brubanj">Brubanj</a> by Bojna. Since the Turks conquered all that territory up to the XV. century, including the original home of the family, Blagaj on the Sana (about 1540), the Blagaji relocated to their lands on the Korana; Hrapavci and Stojmerići became dependent on Blagaj for defense. The lords, Juraj and Antun were sentenced to loss of property by the abbot of <a href="Topusko">Topusko</a>, but the decision was never finalised, and the king himself confirmed their possession of Stojmerić. Stijepan Blagaj bought the castle of <a href="Smr%C4%8Dkovi%C4%87">Smrčković</a> near the source of the <a href="Glina%20%28river%29">Glina</a> between <a href="Kloko%C4%8D%20castle">Klokoč</a> and Stojmerić.

The Blagaj family fought unusually long against the Turks. In 1563, the regional general wrote that lord Franjo Blagaj guarded his castle "Turanj" on the Korana in person, and in 1572, a permanent guard was approved for his domain. In 1574, Franjo Blagaj and Nikola Frankopan complained to the general that the soldiers sent were pillaging, and so the general gave Blagaj and Bosiljevo castle the right to resist the soldiers. In 1576, <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Bosnia">Kapidži ban</a> invaded the Korana with a force 2000 strong and carried off 170 people from around Blagaj-Turanj and Skrad in the winter, and both strongholds were destroyed in the battles. In 1582, the general planned for the rebuilding of Blagaj, but because of the attack of Hasan paša in 1584, the castle remained deserted.

Stijepan Blagaj had already fled to <a href="Kranj">Kranj</a> in 1547, receiving the castle of <a href="Ko%C4%8Devje">Kočevje</a>. The last Blagaji, Franjo and Stjepan the younger, continued to resist, but they too had to flee to <a href="Kieselstein%20Castle">Kranj</a>, from where they continued to fight on the Ottoman front. After the death of Franjo Slunjski, there was a push to make Franjo Blagajski the Ban of Croatia, led by the ban and Cardinal <a href="Juraj%20Dra%C5%A1kovi%C4%87">Juraj Drašković</a>, and the Croatian nobility made him the chief of defense of the region south of the river <a href="Kupa">Kupa</a> in 1574, and he died in 1583. Stjepan Blagajski served as a captain in the army of <a href="Karlovac">Karlovac</a>, but he died in a battle with the Turks by <a href="Zve%C4%8Daj">Zvečaj</a> in 1598. Grgur Blagaj, son of Franjo, was also in the army, and died in 1590.

The Blagaji had received permission to return to their possessions should they be recaptured, and when after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Karlowitz">Treaty of Karlowitz</a> in 1699 the castle was repaired for military purposes, Eberhard Blagaj came from Kranj to Croatia and cared for those possessions in the time of king Leopold of Austria. The house of Blagaj never fully returned from Kranj, even after selling the Kočevje in 1619 and buying <a href="Bo%C5%A1tanj">Boštanj castle</a> on the other side of the Sava (which they held until the end of the 19th century when the male line died out). By the year 1700, the square tower in the centre of the castle was only half the height. Soldiers were stationed in the ruins of Blagaj until 1865, but after that, it was left to fall apart.

The Irish hopes rested with Ivy Hall Flash the beaten English Derby favourite and finalist, <a href="1970%20Irish%20Greyhound%20Derby">defending champion</a> Monalee Pride, <a href="Gay%20McKenna">Gay McKenna</a>'s Postal Vote, the 1970 Irish greyhound of the year Mark Anthony, and coursing champion Hack up Fenian.
With such a star studded line up, the competition seemed destined for great things and in the very first round Ivy Hall Flash recorded 29.10. Ante-post favourite Postal Vote and <a href="Corn%20Cuchulainn">Corn Cuchulainn</a> winner Fleur des Lis also won. There was a <a href="Ger%20McKenna">Ger McKenna</a> double, after both Mr Lir and Hopeful Hope won but there was a big shock as Moordyk Champion failed to qualify.
Heavy rain prevailed during the second round but Ivy Hall Flash impressed again in a time of 29.53. Clerihan Venture won again and Postal Vote qualified finishing second in his heat. Other winners included Duval Prince, Monalee Pride and Butlers Glen. 

Before the semi-finals Ivy Hall Flash and Postal Vote were both quoted at short odds of 7-4 to win the competition. Clerihan Venture was withdrawn injured before the English challenger Sole Aim ran superbly beating Postal Vote in a time of 28.99. Gahans Wood claimed the next semi-final pushing Time Up Please into second place in 29.37 and the final heat saw Butlers Glen overtake and beat Ivy Hall Flash in a shock result timed at 29.45. 

The final featured three big names and it was the same trio that took the first three places. Postal Vote was first out of traps and gained a decent lead. By the second bend Sole Aim had forced his way on the inside of Postal Vote taking the lead at the third bend before coming home to win the Derby. Sole Aim had won the event for England, home track <a href="Walthamstow%20Stadium">Walthamstow</a> and owner Mrs Frances Chandler. Postal Vote held off Ivy Hall Flash for second place.

He was born in the Changle province of <a href="Fujian">Fujian</a> to a prestigious family. He was considered a “Treasure” and a key figure in China's history of art.

At the age of eight, he fell off a <a href="Hillock">swell</a> and lost his hearing as a result of his injuries.

Airport Surface Surveillance Capability

Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC) is a <a href="runway">runway</a>-safety tool that displays aircraft and ground vehicles on the airport surface, as well as aircraft on approach and departure paths within a few miles of the airport. The tool allows <a href="air%20traffic%20controller">air traffic controller</a>s and air crew in cockpits equipped with <a href="Automatic%20Dependent%20Surveillance-Broadcast">Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast</a> (ADS-B) to detect potential runway conflicts by providing detailed coverage of movement on runways and <a href="taxiway">taxiway</a>s. By collecting and fusing data from a variety of sources, ASSC is able to track vehicles and <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a> on <a href="airport">airport</a> surfaces and obtain identification information from aircraft ADS-B <a href="transponder">transponder</a>s.

ASSC provides similar capabilities and displays as <a href="ASDE-X">ASDE-X</a>, as both systems provide real-time tracking information of ground movements using the same set of instruments. <a href="San%20Francisco%20International%20Airport">San Francisco International Airport</a> was the first domestic airport to implement ASSC in October 2016.

Operation.
Like ASDE-X, ASSC receives inputs from a variety of sensors, including:

After the inputs are collected, the ASSC controller performs automated conflict detecting and alerting using the same human-machine interface as implemented in the 35 ASDE-X sites. ASSC is part of ADS-B, which is one of the key elements of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) <a href="Next%20Generation%20Air%20Transportation%20System">Next Generation Air Transportation System</a> implementation.

The nine ASSC sites used the Airport Surface Detection Equipment, Model 3 radar (ASDE-3) to provide <a href="Airport%20Movement%20Area%20Safety%20System">Airport Movement Area Safety System</a> (AMASS). The similar ASDE-X program also used ASDE-3 radar, but the primary difference between ASSC and ASDE-X is that ASSC does not require ASDE-3 input.

Pardo Venus

The Pardo Venus is a painting by the Venetian artist <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, completed in 1551 and now in the <a href="Louvre%20Museum">Louvre Museum</a>. It is also known as Jupiter and Antiope, since it seems to show the story of <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Antiope%20%28mother%20of%20Amphion%29">Antiope</a> from Book VI of the "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>" (lines 110-111). It was the first major mythological painting produced by the artist for <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> and was long kept in the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20El%20Pardo">Royal Palace of El Pardo</a> near <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="Prado">Prado</a>, a purpose-built museum), hence its usual name. 

Analysis of its style and composition shows that Titian modified a Bacchanalian scene he had begun much earlier in his career by completing the landscape background and adding figures. For <a href="Sydney%20Joseph%20Freedberg">Sidney Freedburg</a> it was "probably in substance an invention of the later 1530s, though significantly reworked later; it is full of motifs and ideas that have been recollected from an earlier and more Giorgionesque time, ordered in an obvious and uncomplicated classicizing scheme."

Though meeting the basic definition of Titian's famous "poesie" series, mythological scenes from <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> painted for Philip, the painting is typically not counted in the series, presumably as it was begun well before Titian used the term in a letter to Philip. 

Description.
The painting is very large, and the figures somewhat disconnected, the composition divided into two by the tree at centre. In the right foreground we have a scene that would have been familiar to well-educated Renaissance viewers as Jupiter, having taken the form of a <a href="satyr">satyr</a>, creeping up on the sleeping nymph Antiope, and lifting her drapery to view her naked. He will shortly rape her. Possibly the situation is only borrowed from this story, but all Titian's other mythological paintings for Philip show scenes from Ovid, where Antiope's story features. The painting can be compared to his "<a href="The%20Bacchanal%20of%20the%20Andrians">The Bacchanal of the Andrians</a>" of 1523-24 (<a href="Prado">Prado</a>), where an apparently unconscious nude in a version of the "Dresden Venus" pose shares the picture space with a group of revellers in a mixture of nudity, contemporary and classical dress. 

Antiope sleeps as yet undisturbed, not only by the voyeur, but a hunting scene above her, where hounds have brought down a stag, and immediately left of her, a satyr or <a href="faun">faun</a> with the legs of a <a href="goat">goat</a> seated on the ground, in conversation with a lady in contemporary dress. Immediately beside them stands a hunter, with large dogs, and at far left another huntsman blows a horn.

Over Venus' head, <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a> perches in a tree, with an arrow in his bow, apparently pointed at Jupiter. In the middle distance a naked couple kiss on the banks of a river.

Meaning.
Art historians have struggled somewhat in trying to find a coherent meaning for these disparate elements. Their incongruous combination makes it something of a test case for a long-running dispute over the extent to which Titian's mythological paintings (and to some extent those of Venetian painters in general) carry "great complexity of allegorical meanings", in the way that some works of other Renaissance artists are generally accepted to do. 

<a href="Harold%20Wethey">Harold Wethey</a> was not impressed by the idea that the different elements represented different modes of life: "active" in the hunters, "voluptuous" in Venus and Jupiter, and "contemplative" in the couple sitting on the grass. Another line of thinking is to compare Venus to the stag brought down by the hounds, the stag then becoming a "cerf fragile", in an old Gothic visual metaphor with the hunted stag representing the life and trials of <a href="Christ">Christ</a> or man. This draws on a wealth of imagery in religious writings, ultimately going back to "<a href="Psalm%2041">Psalm 41</a>/42": "As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God..".

Titian's reclining nudes.
The painting is a development of Titian's compositions with a reclining female nude in the Venetian style. The pose of the "Pardo Venus", with one arm drawn up to support the head and the other resting near the crotch, is essentially the same as that in <a href="Giorgione">Giorgione</a>'s "<a href="Dresden%20Venus">Dresden Venus</a>", which after his death in 1510 was completed by Titian. The pose apart, the paintings offer a strong contrast, with the noisy and hectic scene in the "Pardo Venus" completely different from the tranquil and deserted landscape in Dresden. Around 1534 Titian had painted the "<a href="Venus%20of%20Urbino">Venus of Urbino</a>", and a repetition of this from 1545, perhaps a lost recorded "Venus" sent to Charles V, "was the basis" for the "<a href="Venus%20and%20Musician">Venus and Musician</a>" series, which exists in several versions. Unlike the others, the Cupid in most versions of "Venus and Musician", and probably in the "Pardo Venus", does allow a clear identification of the female as Venus, despite the modern decor. 

Otherwise the paintings are in danger of falling into the category showing <a href="courtesan">courtesan</a>s, though these are also often described as "Venus", if only to retain some propriety. In all an unembarassed Venus is completely naked, except for a gauzy cloth over her crotch in some versions, but wears several pieces of very expensive jewellery, typical aspects of courtesan pictures. 

<a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a> described the "Pardo Venus" as a "laboured attempt to recapture his early style", and the Dresden/Urbino pose here "much coarsened". A more original composition and physique, also begun in the mid-1540s, but with versions painted in the 1550s and perhaps 1560s, is used in the <a href="Dana%C3%AB%20%28Titian%20series%29">series of "Danaë" paintings</a>, which Clark sees as Titian adopting the conventions for the nude prevailing outside Venice; "in the rest of Italy bodies of an entirely different shape had long been fashionable". 

For Clark, the Venus of the "Venus and Musician" versions, where the head changes direction but the body remains exactly the same, is "entirely Venetian, younger sister of all those expensive ladies whom <a href="Palma%20Vecchio">Palma Vecchio</a>, <a href="Paris%20Bordone">Paris Bordone</a> and <a href="Bonifazio%20Veronese">Bonifazio</a> painted for local consumption."

History.
In 1574 Titian had still not been paid for the painting, according to a list he sent Philip's secretary and <a href="favourite">favourite</a> <a href="Antonio%20P%C3%A9rez%20%28statesman%29">Antonio Pérez</a>. The painting was still in El Pardo when most of the palace burnt down in 1603, with the loss of several Titians and other important art. <a href="Vicente%20Carducho">Vicente Carducho</a> (1576/78–1638), an Italian-born court painter in Spain, records that when he heard the news, the first question of King <a href="Philip%20III%20of%20Spain">Philip III of Spain</a> was to ask if the Venus had been lost. Told that it survived, he is said to have commented "I am satisfied, for the rest will be redone". 

Despite this prestige, the painting was given to <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I of England</a> in 1623 when, as <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, he made a quixotic, unauthorized and unplanned visit to <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> to try to acquire a Spanish bride. After Charles' execution the valuers assessing his collection in <a href="Whitehall%20Palace">Whitehall Palace</a> found the "great Lardge and famous peece" in the "Second and Middle Privie Lodging Roome", along with the "<a href="Venus%20and%20Musician">Venus and Musician</a>" now in the Prado, and valued them at £500 and £150 respectively. They were both bought on the same day in 1649 at one of the sales of Charles' art collection by <a href="John%20Hutchinson%20%28Roundhead%29">Colonel John Hutchinson</a>, who paid £600 and £165. Hutchinson was buying as an investment, and as the major continental collectors realized the situation and organized agents, he sold all his major purchases within a few years. 

<a href="Alonso%20de%20C%C3%A1rdenas%20%28ambassador%29">Alonso de Cárdenas</a> the Spanish ambassador, managing purchases in England a year or two later, declined to buy the "Pardo Venus", preferring <a href="Correggio">Correggio</a>'s "<a href="Venus%20with%20Mercury%20and%20Cupid%20%28%27The%20School%20of%20Love%27%29">Venus with Mercury and Cupid ('The School of Love')</a>" (now <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>), as "no es tan profano como la otra, Venus dormido y el Satyro" ("it is not as profane as the other, Venus sleeping and the satyr"). In 1653, Hutchinson skillfully negotiated Bordeaux-Neufville, who combined the roles of French ambassador and <a href="Cardinal%20Mazarin">Cardinal Mazarin</a>'s art agent, into paying £1,200 for it. It was acquired from Mazarin's heirs in 1661 by <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a>, and remained in the French royal collection until this passed to the Louvre Museum.

Dr. D’Hondt’s research program investigates microbial communities in subseafloor sediments, with projects looking at the global distribution of cells, the energetics of subseafloor communities, ancient sedimentary DNA, and the acidification of estuaries due to human impact. In a 2009 study, his group examined sediments from below the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Gyre">South Pacific Gyre</a>, an area of ocean between Australia and South America where little organic matter falls to the seafloor. They discovered very low numbers of microbial cells and the presence of oxygen several meters down. Sediments with greater numbers of microbes lack oxygen at these depths. In a 2015 study, D’Hondt led a research group that demonstrated that oxygen penetrates the entire sediment column in as much as one third of the world’s oceans. This oxygen likely affects microbial metabolism in these sediments and may be transported into the underlying <a href="Mantle%20%28geology%29">mantle</a>.

White Bear Tavern

White Bear Tavern () is a former <a href="kafana">kafana</a> in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, in the municipality of <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a>. First mentioned in 1658, it is the oldest surviving edifice on the territory of modern Belgrade, not counting the <a href="Belgrade%20Fortress">Belgrade Fortress</a>. However, Zemun developed completely independently from Belgrade for centuries and for the most part during the history two towns belonged to two different states. Zemun became part of the same administrative unit as Belgrade on 4 October 1929, lost a separate town status to Belgrade in 1934 and made a continuous built-up area with Belgrade only since the 1950s. Hence, the <a href="House%20at%2010%20Cara%20Du%C5%A1ana%20Street">House at 10 Cara Dušana Street</a> in Belgrade's downtown neighborhood of <a href="Dor%C4%87ol">Dorćol</a> is usually named as the oldest house in Belgrade, while the White Bear Tavern is titled as the oldest house in Zemun.

Location.
The house is located in the neighborhood of <a href="%C4%86ukovac">Ćukovac</a>, at 10 "Vasilija Vasilijevića" street, not far away from <a href="Muhar">Muhar</a> and Zemun's main street, "Glavna".

History.
It is not recorded when the house was built, but it is believed that it originates from the first half of the 17th century. French traveler Michel Quiclet visited Zemun in 1658, then part of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. He mentions the house as the largest of three <a href="Khan%20%28inn%29">khans</a> in town. The house is also depicted on the 1663 military map of Zemun, made by the German cartographer Heinrich Ottendorf in 1663. House is mentioned in 1717, when <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Prince Eugene of Savoy</a> dwelled in it, preparing for the <a href="Siege%20of%20Belgrade%20%281717%29">siege of Belgrade</a>. The object was later named the "Zartaken" and as such appeared on the oldest urban plan of Zemun from 1740. The plan numbered 550 objects in town, in 13 streets.

During the 18th century, the ground floor was turned into kafana. In the late 19th century it was owned by Naum Nikolić, who then sold it to Todor Marić Gačula while in 1927 Marko Todorović Čanak bought the premises. It is not known when and how the kafana got its name. It was originally called only "Kod medveda" ("Bear's"). The kafana was noted for its "cimer", a hanging tin plaque with an image of the standing bear. As the town's <a href="House%20painter%20and%20decorator">house painters</a> gathered in the kafana, celebrating their <a href="guild">guild</a>'s festivities, they often painted the "cimer", changing the color of the bear, into black, grey or white. As they mostly painted it in white, the locale became known as the "White Bear". Though named after the paint, white bear is Serbian name for <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a>. Todorović, who was nicknamed Marko Medved after the kafana, owned the tavern until 1948 when the state nationalized it, leaving the Todorović family to live in the residential area on the first floor. Until the early 1960s, when it was closed, the tavern was quite popular.

Architecture.
The house is the only remaining example of the typical Balkan architecture in the <a href="Old%20Core%20of%20Zemun">Old Core of Zemun</a>, from the period of Ottoman rule (16-17th century). It is one-storey edifice, built in the "bondruk" manner, with timber construction filled with unbaked bricks. It had commercial venues on the ground floor with residential rooms above. It is the oldest surviving edifice on the urban territory of Belgrade and was location of the first kafana in Zemun.

Underground.
A two-forked underground corridor, called "lagum", was dug beneath the house. One is and the other is long. The walls are laid with bricks. While the house served as the kafana, they were used as a refrigerator. During the winters, when the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> would freeze, the ice was cut with the saw and brought into the "lagum". The food and drinks where kept in the layers of ice and straw. They were called "ledenica" ("ice room") and were usually allowed to be entered only once a day. As the corridors had good ventilation and a proper temperature, they were used as the <a href="wine%20cellar">wine cellar</a>, too. There are additional "lagums" around the house. One, which is directly accessible from the living room of the present tenants on the first floor, is used as the <a href="larder">larder</a>, since the temperature is constant throughout the year, at .

Today.
The house is placed under the "preliminary protection", but it hasn't been kept by the city or preserved in any way.

Marantette House

The Marantette House is a private house located on Simpson Road in <a href="Mendon%2C%20Michigan">Mendon, Michigan</a>. It is significant as an impressive vernacular version of <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival architecture</a>, and as one of the few local examples of a riverfront orientation of a house, dating from when river traffic dominated area transportation. The house was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1973.

History.
In 1829, brothers Peter and James Godfroy established a trading post on this site, which was then called Notawasepe, to trade with the local <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a>. Their father, Col. Gabriel
Godfroy, was the Sub Agent of Indian Affairs for the <a href="Michigan%20Territory">Michigan Territory</a>. The Godfroys themselves remained in their home in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, and Frances Mouton worked as their agent here at Notawasepe. The Godfroys owned a second trading post at <a href="Coldwater%2C%20Michigan">Coldwater</a>; their agent there was James's brother-in-law, Patrick Marantette. In 1833, Marantette replaced Mouton at Notawasepe. However, that same year the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Chicago">Treaty of Chicago</a> was signed, which took most of the land owned by the local band of Potawatomi. Although some land was left to them, the US government was encouraging Native Americans to move west of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, and the writing was on the wall.

In 1835, Marantette married Francis Mouton, the daughter of Frances Mouton. That same year, he began working on constructing this house. He continued to provide supplies to the local band of Indians, but in 1840, the government decided to force the Indians to move. Negotiations to effect the move were undertaken at the Marantette House. The Potawatomi were persuaded to move, and Marantette was instructed to provide them with supplies totaling several thousand dollars. The US government failed to reimburse him for the expense until 1850, leading him to sell off much of his surrounding land to cover the costs.

Patrick and Francis Marantette raised their family in this house, and lived there until their deaths. It passed on to their descendants, and Marantette family members continued to own it through at least the early 1970s.

Description.
The Marantette House is a two-story, frame, <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival</a> house located on a bluff overlooking the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">St. Joseph River</a>. The river side has porches on both stories overlooking the river. A small entryway faced the road. The windows have six over six lights.

<doc id="54732627" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54732627" title="Naualko">
Naualko

The Naualko were an <a href="indigenous%20Australian">indigenous Australian</a> people of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>.

Name.
The name Naualko derives from their word for ‘yes’("naua/nawa" (so written by <a href="Norman%20Tindale">Norman Tindale</a>). The word is now reconstructed as "nhaawu", and thus their <a href="endonym">endonym</a> means 'the people who utter "nhaawu" when they say 'yes.'
Language.
The Naualko language, which was spoken in the <a href="Wilcannia">Wilcannia</a> area, became extinct very early on as colonization began. <a href="Luise%20Hercus">Luise Hercus</a> and others now consider that it is probably related more to <a href="Kurnu%20language">Kurnu</a> than to <a href="Paakantyi%20language">Paakantyi</a>. It has recently been argued, though no certainty attaches to the hypothesis, that the language of the <a href="Milpulo">Milpulo</a> was a dialect of Naualko.
Country.
The Naulko moved over their tribal terrain's 10,000 sq. miles, in the <a href="Far%20West%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">far western sector</a> of New South Wales, from Dunlop to Murtee on the <a href="Darling%20River">upper Darling River</a>. They were also around the lower <a href="Paroo%20River">Paroo River</a> north to Lake Tongo.

People.
It has been suggested that the Naualko might be classified as a northern branch of the <a href="Paakantyi">Paakantyi</a>. Norman Tindale, taking into consideration the distinctive word for 'yes' in their <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a>, argues that the probabilities lie with their being an independent tribe. In addition, early settlers like <a href="Frederic%20Bonney">Frederic Bonney</a>, familiar with the area's tribes, treated them as a discrete group.

Douglas County Courthouse (Illinois)

The Douglas County Courthouse is a government building in <a href="Tuscola%2C%20Illinois">Tuscola</a>, the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of <a href="Douglas%20County%2C%20Illinois">Douglas County</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Completed in 1913, it is the third <a href="courthouse">courthouse</a> in the history of Douglas County.

Douglas County's first pioneers arrived in 1829, although occasional <a href="squatting">squatters</a> had been present beforehand. The widespread prairies were deemed a barrier to early settlement, so the population of the area (then part of <a href="Coles%20County%2C%20Illinois">Coles County</a>) remained low into the 1850s, and Douglas County was formed in 1859. The bill providing for the creation of the county permitted an April 1859 public vote on the location of the seat, and candidate communities included Tuscola, <a href="Arcola%2C%20Illinois">Arcola</a>, <a href="Camargo%2C%20Illinois">Camargo</a>, and <a href="Hackett%27s%20Grove%2C%20Illinois">Hackett's Grove</a>. The county court quickly annulled this vote, due to gross <a href="electoral%20fraud">electoral fraud</a> (the number of votes from both Tuscola and Arcola was ten times the number of voters in the two towns), and only after a second vote one month later could the seat's assignment to Tuscola be settled.

The county's first court session was held in an <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Railroad">Illinois Central</a> depot, and later sessions in two different commercial buildings, including one rented by the county recorder. The initial purpose-built courthouse was a small wooden building, which was erected at private expense. Construction began in 1864 on the second courthouse, a two-<a href="storey">story</a> brick building with sheriff's house and jail in the basement. O.L. Kinney, the Chicago architect responsible for the design, projected a $15,000 cost, but the final cost amounted to nearly three times that estimate. Further costs appeared on an annual basis, due to numerous problems that required expensive maintenance, and the placement of the jail inside the courthouse was eventually deemed unsafe to use. Consequently, the current courthouse was built in its place over a two-year period, beginning in 1911 and being completed in 1913. A stone <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical</a> structure with a three-part facade featuring <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic</a> columns in the center, it cost approximately $170,000 to complete.

Many of Ankhefensekhmet's ancestors bore the title of "Chief of master-craftsmen", more commonly referred as "<a href="High%20Priest%20of%20Ptah">High Priest of Ptah</a>". <a href="Robert%20K.%20Ritner">Robert K. Ritner</a> suggested that the mention of pharaohs of the <a href="Hyksos">Hyksos</a> period (<a href="Apepi%20%28pharaoh%29">Apepi</a>, the otherwise unknown <a href="Sharek">Sharek</a> and Aaqen) should reflects the continuity of the sequence of ancestors, rather than an acceptance of the Hyksos rule by the indigenous people of Egypt; in fact, the name "Aaqen", which means "Valiant ass", looks like an intentional misspelling of "Strong of valour". Still earlier, <a href="Alan%20Gardiner">Alan Gardiner</a> also suggested that Aaqen may be a mocking name for Aaqenenre ("Great and strong is Ra"), which is one of Apepi's throne names.

Henry Orange Glidden

Henry Orange Glidden was an architect, artist, and dedicated supporter of the arts who lived and worked in eastern Massachusetts during the first three quarters of the 20th century.

Biography.
Henry was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, on April 5, 1891 to Charles Henry Glidden and May Grace Orange. He was thus a member of the eighth generation of the Glidden family in the United States. He graduated from the <a href="Cambridge%20Rindge%20and%20Latin%20School">Rindge Manual Training School</a> in Cambridge, MA, in 1909. Thereafter, he attended the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) where he graduated at the head of his class in 1913 with a Bachelor of Science degree. In 1914 he was awarded a Master of Science degree, also from MIT.

Henry married his first wife, Dorothy Ayer, in Cambridge on June 15, 1916. They had two daughters, Dorothy (Jackson, MI), May 15, 1917 and Frances (Melrose, MA), December 17, 1921. Dorothy Ayer died tragically at age 31 in Arlington on August 5, 1921. He was married twice more, first to Ethel L. and finally, in 1958, to Jane Doughty.

His first job out of MIT was with the Carr Fastener Company in Melrose Highlands. During the depression he worked on a <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">WPA</a>-sponsored project which required accurate copies of famous old buildings in New England. Some of his work done at that time is in the files of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Later he worked as an architect for the Turner Construction Company. He was a member of the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Rockland, a member of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountain%20Club">Appalachian Mountain Club</a>, and a 50-year member of the <a href="http%3A//www.columbianlodge.org">Columbian Masonic Lodge, A.F. & A.M.</a>

Henry died on March 16, 1978 and was interred in the Mount Vernon Cemetery in Abington, MA.

Artwork.
Most of all, however, Henry loved art. In 1913, while a senior at MIT, he agreed to draw the poster for the school's annual Tech Show, a vaudeville-style production of song and dance. See thumbnail left. In later life, he was one of the founders of the Abington Art Association, its president for three years, executive committee member, and secretary. He was also a member of the Brockton Art Center, now known as the <a href="Fuller%20Craft%20Museum">Fuller Craft Museum</a>, and for many years a member of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Boston">Boston Museum of Fine Arts</a>.

Over his life, he exhibited in many art shows which included Abington, Norwell, Duxbury, Weymouth, Braintree, Scituate, Cohasset and Concord Art Associations, State Federation of Women's Clubs and Visual Art Club of Bridgewater State College. He had one-man shows at the Universalist-Unitarian Church in Brockton, Oyster Harbor Club, Osterville, North Quincy Public Library, Utica Mutual Insurance Company, IBM Building, Waltham, and Milton Hill House, Milton. In 1963 his watercolor "Rocky Coast" received the highest popular vote in this class at the annual Jordan Marsh Exhibition by New England artists, winning the Richard Mitton Gold Medal Award.
Gallery.
Although Henry did some work with oil and pastels, most of his extant paintings are water colors. His subjects were diverse, ranging from portraits to sea- and landscapes, and even the occasional still life. Here are some examples:

James Hobrecht

James Friedrich Ludolf Hobrecht (31 December 1825 in Memel - 8 September 1902 in Berlin) was an influential Prussian director for urban planning. His development plan of 1862 for a million-sized Berlin was soon to be simply called the <a href="Hobrecht-Plan">Hobrecht-Plan</a>. His main focus was on modern sewer systems for which he was well known in the late 19th century.

Biography.
Hobrecht was born as the son of the estate owner Ludolph Hobrecht and his wife Isabella (born Johnson) in East Prussian Memel. He has an elder brother Arthur Hobrecht who would later become the mayor of Berlin. In 1834 his father was called to the royal economic council and the family moved to <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>. In 1841, Hobrecht broke off his school education and began an apprenticeship as geodesist (professional <a href="Surveying">land surveyor</a>) for which he passed examination in 1845. Until 1847 he was engaged in separation work (clearing the pathway of transportation projects from rocks and hills) in East Prussia as well as the <a href="Cologne-Minden%20Railway%20Company">Cologne-Minden Railway</a>. During the <a href="German%20revolutions%20of%201848%E2%80%9349">German revolutions of 1848</a> he served in the student guards at the <a href="Berlin%20Palace">Berlin Palace</a>.

By 1947 he had started studies at the Berlin <a href="Bauakademie">Bauakademie</a> (one of the institutes that would later form the <a href="Technical%20University%20of%20Berlin">Technical University of Berlin</a>). While at the building academy he was an active member of the "Akademischer Verein 'Motiv'" student association. The fraternity was originally a loose group of students interested in arts and philosophy founded in 1847 as a chorus. Along with the rise of the academy it quickly grew by size and influence on contemporary architecture. Being at the academy he attended a variety of courses until his examination as "Bauführer" (academic <a href="site%20manager">site manager</a>) in 1849. Right after examination he joined the "Architekten- und Ingenieur-Verein zu Berlin" professional association of architects in Berlin. He held different management positions in the circle until he was called off to the infantery regiment in the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Hesse">Electorate of Hesse</a> in 1850.

His first professional work is recorded with the building of the "Packhof" in Königsberg 1in 1851, being back in Eastern Prussia. In 1852 there are records of managing the Dirscheim estate in <a href="Sambia%20Peninsula">Samland</a>. On 4 February 1853 he did marry Henriette Wolff. The couple had three sons and four daughters in the coming years.

James Hobrecht continued his studies in <a href="civil%20engineering">civil engineering</a> with records of field placements at the <a href="Prussian%20Eastern%20Railway">Prussian Eastern Railway</a> in 1857. In 1858 he passed examination in transporation planning (Wasser-, Wege- und Eisenbahnbaumeister) and he found an employment at the royal-prussian urban planning police (Baupolizei) in the same year. In that role he was commanded in 1859 to head the commission on creation of a land-use plan for Berlin and its environs. As part of his job he traveled to Hamburg, Paris and London in 1860 to learn about the contemporary development status in urban planning especially their sewer systems. Before the plan was finished the city came to an amalgamation of its suburbs on 1. January 1961. Based on the just finished land surveys and existing land-use proposals James Hobrecht constructed a map showing a possible land-use for a city at a projected size of 1.5 to 2 million inhabitants. The map of building lines was soon to be called the <a href="Hobrecht-Plan">Hobrecht-Plan</a> but he was not able to continue on the details due to his dismissal on 15. December 1861, even before the resolution of the planning works on 18. July 1862.

The reasons for the job termination are unknown. He went to <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a> to construct the water supply system for the city and to create plans for a modern sewer system that would started to be built by 1870. Before the project was realized in Stettin, he was able to return to Berlin in 1869 where he was commissioned to build a sewer system for the city. This was enabled by his brother <a href="Arthur%20Hobrecht">Arthur Hobrecht</a>, who would become lord mayor of Berlin in 1972, and <a href="Rudolf%20Virchow">Rudolf Virchow</a>, who had already been a famous medical doctor and influential liberal politician. He layed out plans for a radial system of 12 main routes of canalization from the city to new <a href="sewage%20farm">sewage farm</a>s on the outskirts of Berlin. Soon after his brother took office the grand pipes were constructed from 1873 until the last one in 1893. While the works were ongoing we was called to help with the planning of the sewer systems of as many as 30 German cities and the sewer systems in Moscow, Tokyo and Cairo.

From 1872 to 1874 he had a teaching assignment at the Bauakademie. In 1885 he was elected to head the municipal urban planning departement, a position that he held for twelve years. Most of the embankments of the river <a href="Spree">Spree</a> were built under his leadership allowing larger ships to pass through the city. In 1897 he retired for health reasons. In the same year he was honored with the title of "Stadtältester von Berlin". He remained in the city until his death in 1902. His grave can be found on the <a href="Friedhof%20II%20der%20Sophiengemeinde%20Berlin">Friedhof II der Sophiengemeinde Berlin</a>.

Influence and Legacy.
When James Hobrecht was commanded to head the urban planning commission for Berlin in 1859 he was just 34 years old and he had only minor experience compared to the size of the project which included 14 chapters. Actually he was just replacing a colleague who had fallen sick at the time. The shortcomings of the crowded <a href="tenement%23Berlin">Mietskaserne tenement blocks</a> were largely attributed to that fact by historians in the early 20th century. Even the deadly street fights of fascist and communist squadrons in those area have been traced back to the Hobrecht-Plan that he created at that time. Modern historians are more favourable as his writings do also include chapters on estimates of the social consequences and his planning was good enough for later reformations that allowed Berlin to grow successfully.

In 1868 he published the influential paper "Ueber öffentliche Gesundheitspflege und die Bildung eines Central-Amts für öffentliche Gesundheitspflege im Staate" (on the public health issues and the founding of a central office in the governement) that was spawned by a Cholera epidemic at the time. He is still favouring the "Durcheinanderwohnen" (mixed class housing) in the tenement areas but criticizes the catastrophic housing conditions that had developed in the <a href="Wilhelmine%20Ring%20%28Berlin%29">Wilhelmine Ring of Berlin</a>. He finds support from Rudolph Virchow who had the same agenda on improving public health and housing conditions. With his wide knowledge on sewer systems and land-use for its pipes, he is the technician being in need to bring these reform ideas into reality.

Soon after his return to Berlin he is one of the founders of the "Deutsche Vierteljahrsschrift für öffentliche Gesundheitspflege" (Quarterly Magazine on Public Health) in 1869. Between 1870 and 1879 he publishes 13 issues of "Reinigung und Entwässerung von Berlin. Einleitende Verhandlungen und Berichte über mehrere auf Veranlassung des Magistrats der Königlichen Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin angestellte Versuche und Untersuchungen" (water treatement and sewer systems of Berlin. Introduction and reports on experiments and studies on request of the municipal government of Berlin). When the Berlin sewer system started to work successfully, with much of an improvement to inhabitants of Berlin, he became a well-known expert in the field - helping later with the planning in Moscow in 1880, in Tokyo in 1886 and in Cairo in 1892.

In 1964 she was awarded a doctorate and in 1965, she passed the first state examination for teachers at secondary schools. After that she was a research associate with <a href="Gerhard%20Oestreich">Gerhard Oestreich</a> and assistant to <a href="Rainer%20Wohlfeil">Rainer Wohlfeil</a>. In 1977, she was appointed Professor of Social and Constitutional History of the Early Modern Period at the <a href="University%20of%20Kassel">University of Kassel</a>. In 2004 she retired, becoming a professor emeritus. She is married to Dieter Wunder and has a daughter.

Wunder became one of the most prestigious representatives of the history of rural society and gender history in the German-speaking world. She was co-editor of two scientific series (Geschichte und Geschlechter; Historische Studien) and the journal "Historische Anthropologie". In recognition of her scientific work and her affinity with the city and the University of Basel, she was honored with the Honorary Doctorate of the Faculty of Philosophy and History of the University of Basel in 2008. In the years 2004 and 2014, two Festschriften were dedicated to her.

Her female students included important gender researchers, including <a href="Kerstin%20Wolff">Kerstin Wolff</a>.

Gender studies.
Her research interests include, in particular, the history of rural society, historical research on women and gender, and <a href="historical%20anthropology">historical anthropology</a>, often involving sociological and cultural sciences and methods, thereby opening up new perspectives. In particular her monograph "He is the Sun, she is the Moon: Women in Early Modern Germany" (Munich, 1992, published in English translation in 1998) has been widely considered beyond the German-speaking world (including an English translation) and is regarded as a fundamental work on early-modern gender history. In this, Wunder, along with many others, developed her concept of the "working couple" ("Arbeitspaar"), according to which, in the early modern era, the working worlds of spouses stood side by side and mutually complement each other.

Rural history.
Heide Wunder investigated historical and contemporary forms of life in the countryside and dealt with the social <a href="microhistory">microhistory</a> of the village. The results of these researches were included in her book "Die bäuerliche Gemeinde in Deutschland" in 1986. In addition, she initiated and led several research projects on the history of rural settlements, most recently the student research project on the history of the village of <a href="Schwebda">Schwebda</a> (on the <a href="Werra">Werra</a>), as well as the interdisciplinary research project 'Großbetrieb und Landschaft im Wandel der Wirtschaftsweisen. Die hessische Domäne Frankenhausen und ihr Umland im 18. bis 20. Jahrhundert' ("Large Business and Landscape in the Changing Economy. The Hessian domain Frankenhausen and its surroundings in the 18th to 20th century"). In his context, she is noted in the Anglophone world for her contribution to the <a href="Brenner%20Debate">Brenner Debate</a>.

The German Port Museum ("Deutsches Hafenmuseum") is a planned nationally funded museum to open in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. The German Federal Parliament’s budget committee approved initial funding of € 94 million to build. 

Scope.
The museum intends to display the commercial and economic history of Germany's largest port, and wider issues of globalization and worldwide trade. 

Building Concept.
"In fact, the <a href="Peking%20%28ship%29">Peking</a> and a <a href="HADAG">Hadag</a> ferry are already important elements, which we think in connection with the new museum.

This is why an architecture that is open and transparent is less built than one in <a href="brick">brick</a> and <a href="castle">castle</a> form. In addition, we need premises, in which we can show large, high and heavy exhibits, a viewing platform will be part of the planning." 

"The concrete design will be organised within the framework of a European architectural competition.

<doc id="54733250" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54733250" title="SegWit">
SegWit

Segregated Witness, or SegWit, is the name used for a proposed <a href="Bitcoin_scalability_problem%23Soft_fork">soft fork</a> change in the transaction format of the <a href="cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> <a href="Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> which has already been implemented on <a href="Litecoin">Litecoin</a> . The formal title "Segregated Witness (Consensus layer)" has Bitcoin Improvement Proposals number BIP141. It is intended to solve a <a href="blockchain">blockchain</a> size limitation problem that reduces Bitcoin transaction speed. It does this by splitting the transaction into two segments, removing the unlocking signature ("witness" data) from the original portion and appending it as a separate structure at the end. The original section would continue to hold the sender and receiver data, and the new "witness" structure would contain scripts and signatures. The original data segment would be counted normally, but the "witness" segment would, in effect, be counted as a quarter its real size.

History.
Why block size limit.
Bitcoin is a "cryptocurrency", a form of "money" using encryption to keep transactions secure. Each record of a unit of Bitcoins is called a "block", and all blocks are tied together sequentially, a mathematical signature of the previous block stored in the next, to form a chain of blocks, or "blockchain".

Each "block" of bitcoins contains information about who sends and receives a given unit of bitcoin (a transaction), as well as the signature that approves each transaction. Originally, there was no limit to the size of these blocks. But this meant that malicious people could make up fake "block" data that was very long as a form of DoS (<a href="Denial%20of%20Service">Denial of Service</a> attack). Their fake blocks would be detected, but doing so would take a very long time, slowing down the whole system.

The solution implemented was to put a limit on block size. That limit was 1 <a href="Megabyte">MB</a>. This way, attacks using huge blocks would be instantly detected and rejected, without significantly slowing the network.

The problem(s).
Unfortunately, as Bitcoin has become more popular, <a href="Bitcoin_scalability_problem">that limit is slowing down transactions</a>. A block is added to the chain every ten minutes. With a limit on its size, only so many transactions can be added, as many as fit in a block. Globally, bitcoin cannot currently support transactions with anything like the speed of other currencies or credit cards. It sometimes takes hours to confirm a transaction.

Some sites work around this problem, by conducting "off-chain payments", conducting transactions without waiting for confirmation by the blockchain. However, many people do not trust this solution, which obviously is open to exploitation. 

Others have proposed changes to Bitcoin that would reform the way it's done, but that would not be backward-compatible. For example, <a href="FlexTrans">FlexTrans</a> (Flexible Transactions) would make transactions smaller by changing how they are described to a "tag" system, allowing more in blocks of the current size. But it is not compatible with systems that do not upgrade.

Likewise, there are a number of other, unrelated problems that have arisen with the bitcoin protocol. 

The most important is "transaction <a href="malleability%20%28cryptography%29">malleability</a>". While a transaction is signed, the signature doesn't include all transaction data, and at one time checking that the signature was correct was not even required. This means that several different ways of losing or stealing bitcoins are possible. While a number of different fixes have made this unlikely to happen, the flaw still exists.

Segregated Witnesses as a solution.
SegWit proposes significant backward compatibility. It hides its increased block size by changing the definition of a block to be measured as one million "units" instead of bytes. The "witness" signature data would be separated from the "<a href="Merkle%20tree">Merkle tree</a>" record of who is sending or receiving the bitcoin. The "witness" data is moved to the end, and each byte of it would only count as one quarter of a "unit". The overall effect would be changing the average block size to about 1.8 MB instead of 1. This means the existing bitcoin protocol doesn't change, allowing it to work without as much upgrading of software.

It also addresses signature malleability, by moving signatures out of the transaction data, making impossible to change it. The transaction ID is no longer malleable. This makes bitcoin safer to use with <a href="Lightning%20Network">Lightning Network</a>, a way to speed up small payments by bundling them and only writing to the blockchain at the beginning and end of their execution, which would be (slightly) risky while the malleability problem still exists.
Activation.
Segregated Witness (BIP141) should not be confused with SegWit2x (SegWit2Mb). In SegWit2Mb it is agreed to first activate Segregated Witness and then a 2 MB <a href="Bitcoin_scalability_problem%23Hard_fork">hard fork</a> within six months as of May 23, 2017.
The proposal SegWit2x and the other proposal <a href="User%20Activated%20Soft%20Fork">UASF</a> BIP148 are both intended to activate Segregated Witness (BIP141).
Segregated Witness is estimated to be activated on August 22 2017.

<doc id="54733262" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54733262" title="Ichaboe Island">
Ichaboe Island

Ichaboe Island is a small rocky island off the <a href="Sperrgebiet">Diamond Coast</a>, <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>. It is recognised by <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> as an <a href="Important%20Bird%20Area">Important Bird Area</a> (IBAs) for its seabird breeding colonies.

Geography.
There are twelve small islands on the Namibian coast between <a href="Walvis%20Bay">Walvis Bay</a> and <a href="Orange%20River">Orange River</a>. Due to the <a href="Benguela%20Current">Benguela Current</a>, the seas on the west coast of southern Africa are some of the most productive in the world. The current flows north from the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> and offshore winds drive the surface water away from the coast. Water rises from depths of hundreds of metres and at speeds of up to 12 m per minute bringing nutrients to the surface. A combination of sunlight and nutrients provide the conditions for <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> which are the foundation for other life in the Benguela marine ecosystem. Feeding on the phytoplankton are <a href="Zooplankton">Zooplankton</a>, which attract an abundance of shoaling <a href="pelagic%20fish">pelagic fish</a> and is the reason why southern Africa is home to one of the richest seabird communities in the world. The islands off the west coast of southern Africa provide refuge from predators and <a href="Cape%20gannet">Cape gannet</a> ("Morus capensis") and <a href="Cape%20cormorant">Cape cormorant</a>s ("Phalacrocorax capensis") are the region's most abundant seabirds with tens of thousands on the islands during the nesting season. The birds guano also provide nutrients which flow into the surrounding sea when large waves hit the island or when it rains. The guano enriches the rocky shore with carpets of seaweed grazed by <a href="goat%27s-eye%20limpet">goat's-eye limpet</a>s, which are predated by <a href="spiny%20starfish">spiny starfish</a>.

Ichaboe Island is a 6.5 ha low-lying island, approximately 1.5 km off the Diamond Coast of Namibia and 48 km north of <a href="L%C3%BCderitz">Lüderitz</a>. On the western side of the island is a reef which affords some protection from Atlantic waves, although sea spay covers the island during storms. The island was once covered in over 7 m of bird-droppings (<a href="guano">guano</a>), which was quarried in the 19th and 20th-centuries for sale as <a href="manure">manure</a>. The rocky ground is now entirely exposed and the eastern side has some sandy areas. Annual rainfall is less than 10 mm and coastal fog is frequent.

Ichaboe Island along with other islands such as <a href="Mercury%20Island">Mercury Island</a> and the nearby coast is recognised by Bird Life International as an Important Bird Area for its seabird colonies.

History.
In the early 19th-century Ichaboe and other islands of the south African coast witnessed the guano equivalent of the <a href="Gold%20rush">American gold rush</a>. The island was once used for <a href="Seal%20hunting">sealing</a> and following a visit in 1828 by <a href="Benjamin%20Morrell">Captain Benjamin Morrell</a> and the discovery of bird manure to depths of more than 7 m, the focus turned to the quarrying of guano. At one time more than 400 ships anchored off the island and <a href="shanty%20town">shanty town</a>s, housed thousands of workers. Large-scale scraping and bagging of ′white gold′ began in 1843 and peaked two years later. The value was so great that competition was fierce, murder committed over harvesting rights and two British warships were despatched to restore order over what became known as the ′Great Guano War′. Britain took procession of the island on 21 June 1861. Guano has been taken off the island regularly and, for example, in 1880 and 1881 Ichaboe Guano was claimed to be the ″richest and most fertilising guano imported into England″ and contained 12 to 13 % <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> and 27 to 30 % guano <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>s. The island was administered by the <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Provincial Administration of South Africa</a> and became a nature reserves in 1987. The islands were returned to Namibia in 1994 and the islands are managed by the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resouces (MFMR). Ichaboe, alongwith Mercury and Possession Islands, have permanent residents who partake in research and conservation of the seabirds. Scraping of guano continues with concessions granted during the 1980s and in 2000 a wall was put up around the perimeter of the island. The wall was built to prevent winds blowing the guano into the sea and has a few entry points for penguins’ to access the breeding areas.

Fauna.
Ichaboe regularly supports over 50,000 seabirds of at least eight species and is consequently one of the most important and densely packed seabird breeding islands in the world. The island holds 65% of the world's <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>, <a href="Cape%20cormorant">Cape cormorant</a> ("Phalacrocorax capensis"), despite the global population falling from 9,000 to less than 5,000 pairs over twenty years. Namibia has c. 4,000 pairs all told. The island is the most important location in the world for the <a href="Near-threatened%20species">near-threatened</a>, <a href="crowned%20cormorant">crowned cormorant</a> ("Phalacrocorax coronatus"), having 4% of the worlds breeding population. Ichaboe also has large numbers of endangered <a href="African%20penguin">African penguin</a> ("Spheniscus demersus") and the <a href="bank%20cormorant">bank cormorant</a> ("Phalacrocorax neglectus"), as well as the <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> <a href="Cape%20gannet">Cape gannet</a> ("Morus capensis"). Smaller numbers of <a href="kelp%20gull">kelp gull</a> ("Larus dominicanus") and <a href="African%20oystercatcher">African oystercatcher</a> ("Haematopus moquini") also breed. Thousands of <a href="common%20tern">common tern</a> ("Sterna hirundo") and <a href="black%20tern">black tern</a> ("Chlidonias niger") may roost on the island.

Whales sighted off the island include the <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a> ("Megaptera novaeangliae") and <a href="southern%20right%20whale">southern right whale</a> ("Eubalaena australis"). The cetaceans, <a href="dusky%20dolphin">dusky dolphin</a> ("Lagenorhynchus obscurus"), <a href="common%20bottlenose%20dolphin">common bottlenose dolphin</a> ("Tursiops truncatus") and the <a href="Endemism">endemic</a>, <a href="Heaviside%27s%20dolphin">Heaviside's dolphin</a> ("Cephalorhynchus heavisidii").

Elena Shirman

Elena Mihailovna Shirman (1908-1942) was a Russian Jewish poet killed in the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

Early life and education.
Elena Mihailovna Shirman was born on February 3, 1908, in Rostov-on-Don, Southern Russia. Her father was a <a href="navigator">navigator</a> and her mother was a teacher. She studied at the Library College in Rostov-on-Don before transferring to the Russian Language and Literature Department of the <a href="Southern%20Federal%20University">Rostov State Pedagogical Institute</a>, from which she graduated in 1933. After graduation she worked in a library and at several museums. From 1937 to 1941 she studied under <a href="Ilya%20Selvinsky">Ilya Selvinsky</a> at the <a href="Gorky%20Literary%20Institute">Gorky Literary Institute</a>. 

Career.
Shirman first began publishing her work in 1924, first in local periodicals and later in the Moscow journals "<a href="Oktyabr%20%28magazine%29">October</a>" (Октябрь) and "Change" (Смена). She also collected and edited <a href="Oral%20tradition">folk tales</a>.

From 1933 to 1936 she worked at various jobs, including bookkeeper for a group of tractor operators, and kitchen assistant at <a href="Selmash%20Plant">Selmash</a>, then the Soviet Union's largest manufacturer of wheat-harvesting machinery. While at Selmash she also taught literature and culture to the children of factory workers. While studying at the Gorky Literary Institute, she also edited several local periodicals and consulted for two youth newspapers, "Lenin's Grandchildren" and "Pioneer's Truth".

At the start of World War II she was drafted into the army, where she served as editor of the army newspaper, "Direct Sights", in which many of her satirical poems appeared. She also wrote copy for posters and <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> leaflets. Her poetry collection, "To the Fighter of Unit N", was published in 1942.

Personal life.
Much of Shirman's writing centers around her unrequited love for a younger man named Valery Marchikhin. She first met Marchikhin when she was in her late twenties, teaching creative writing to youths aged 13 to 15; he was her most promising student. She continued to correspond with him through the late 1930s. 

In 1939, they met again in person. By this time, Marchikhin was a handsome young soldier in the Red Army, and Shirman was a socially awkward, lonely 31-year-old woman. Shirman became infatuated with him, writing many letters to him and poems about him. She did not receive the news of his death in 1941, and assumed he was simply not interested in her. Her best known poem, titled simply, "The Last Poem", is in the form of a farewell letter to Marchikhin. In the poem, the narrator (presumably Shirman) speculates that she will probably die soon; whether by murder, suicide, or some other cause, is not clear.

Death and legacy.
In July 1942, while traveling through the frontline area as a member of the editorial group of the regional Soviet newspaper "" (Hammer), she was captured by <a href="Nazis">Nazis</a> at the Remontnaya railway station in Rostov province, and never heard from again. It was not until twenty years later that the details of her death came to light. According to a woman who lived in the house next door to the station, Shirman's Soviet passport indicated that she was Jewish; as a result, Shirman was included, along with her parents, in a group of Rostov Jews who were arrested and killed. Shirman was forced to watch as the Nazis shot her parents, and then dig their graves. The next day she was forced to undress and dig her own grave, then beaten to death with a shovel. The witness was able to rescue some of Shirman's notebooks from the trash, where the Nazis had thrown them. 

A collection of Shirman's poems was published in Moscow in 1969, and her work is included in several Russian-language anthologies. Natalia Bakulina has published an account of her friendship with Shirman ("Lena"). A selection of Shirman's poems, translated to English, appears in "Young Jewish Poets Who Fell as Soviet Soldiers in the Second World War" by Rina Lapidus, who describes Shirman as an unwitting <a href="feminist">feminist</a>.

<doc id="54733321" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54733321" title="Luca Arbore">
Luca Arbore

Luca Arbore or Arbure (<a href="Early%20Cyrillic%20alphabet">Old Cyrillic</a>: ; <a href="Renaissance%20Latin">Renaissance Latin</a>: "Herborus" or "Copacius"; died April 1523) was a <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>n <a href="Boyars%20of%20Wallachia%20and%20Moldavia">boyar</a>, diplomat, and statesman, several times commander of the <a href="Moldavian%20military%20forces">country's military</a>. He first rose to prominence in 1486, during the rule of <a href="Stephen%20III%20of%20Moldavia">Stephen III</a>, <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia">Prince of Moldavia</a>, to whom he was possibly related. He became the long-serving gatekeeper (or <a href="castellan">castellan</a>) of <a href="Suceava">Suceava</a>, bridging military defense and administrative functions with a diplomatic career. Arbore therefore organized the defense of Suceava during the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281385%E2%80%931569%29">Polish</a> invasion of 1497, after which he was confirmed as one of Moldavia's leading courtiers. As a military commander he participated in Moldavian's occupation of <a href="Pokuttya">Pokuttya</a> in 1502. He is tentatively identified as "Luca the Vlach", who served Stephen on crucial diplomatic missions to Poland and the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow">Grand Duchy of Moscow</a>. Also a great landowner and patron of the arts, Arbore commissioned the painting of <a href="Arbore%20Church">Arbore Church</a>. The building is one of the eight <a href="Churches%20of%20Moldavia">Moldavian churches</a> on the <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Romania">UNESCO World Heritage list</a>.

Gatekeeper Arbore was identified, possibly erroneously, as a pretender to the Moldavian throne in 1505. He still served Stephen's son <a href="Bogdan%20III%20of%20Moldavia">Bogdan III</a>, who needed his services in particular during the Moldavian–Polish border clashes of that year. He maintained his position despite suffering defeat, and, possibly as a "<a href="hetman">hetman</a>", went on to serve as tutor of Bogdan's orphaned son, <a href="Stephen%20IV%20of%20Moldavia">Stephen IV "Ștefăniță"</a>. As such, he aligned the country with Poland and waged war against the <a href="Crimean%20Khanate">Crimean Khanate</a> (a proxy for the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>), winning a major victory at <a href="%C8%98tef%C4%83ne%C8%99ti%2C%20Boto%C8%99ani">Ștefănești</a> in August 1518. 

In 1523, the prince accused the Arbore males of insubordination, and had most of them executed. Although the original accusation was probably spurious, the execution itself sparked an actual boyar revolt. The Arbore line was largely extinguished in 1523, but survived mainly through female descendants; the name was eventually reused by people who were distantly related to the original family, including, in the late 19th-century, the scholar-politician <a href="Zamfir%20Arbore">Zamfir Arbore</a>. By then, the gatekeeper had also been recovered as a symbolic figure in the literature of authors such as <a href="Bogdan%20Petriceicu%20Hasdeu">Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu</a>, <a href="Mihai%20Eminescu">Mihai Eminescu</a>, and <a href="Barbu%20%C8%98tef%C4%83nescu%20Delavrancea">Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea</a>.

Biography.
Early life.
Born at an unknown date, Luca was the son of Cârstea Arbore, who served as "<a href="Burgrave">pârcălab</a>" of <a href="Neam%C8%9B%20Citadel">Neamț Citadel</a> in the 1470s, and his wife Nastasia. Various researchers argue that Cârstea, possibly known as Ioachim in some sources, was brothers with Stephen III—making Luca eligible for the princely throne. Luca also had a brother, the "<a href="Pitar%20%28rank%29">Pitar</a>" Ion, and a sister, Anușca. Anușca went on to marry the boyar Crasnăș. The latter's father, also named Crasnăș, was famous as a dissenting boyar, having reportedly deserted Stephen III during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Baia">Battle of Baia</a>. Cârstea himself remained loyal to the prince down to his death. He was killed by the invading <a href="Ottoman%20army">Ottoman army</a> during the invasion of 1476, either <a href="Battle%20of%20Vaslui">at Vaslui</a> or <a href="Siege%20of%20Neam%C8%9B%20Citadel">in front of Neamț Citadel</a>.

Luca's main office was gatekeeper of <a href="Suceava">Suceava</a> from September 14 (New Style: September 24), 1486. The attributes of this office were greatly expanded by Stephen: it implied command offices in the <a href="Moldavian%20military%20forces">Moldavian military forces</a> and diplomatic functions, obliging Arbore to become a polyglot. By 1500, he was fluent in <a href="Church%20Slavonic%20in%20Romania">Church Slavonic</a>, <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, and Latin. From 1486, Stephen granted his gatekeeper half of Țăpești village, on the <a href="Lozova%20River">Lozova River</a> (the other half was awarded to Duma Burdur in 1499). 

In parallel, Arbore was the squire of <a href="Arbore">an eponymous estate</a> in <a href="Bukovina">Bukovina</a>, and of <a href="%C8%98ipote">Șipote</a>, in <a href="Ia%C8%99i%20County">Iași County</a>. He became "<a href="ktitor">ktitor</a>" of churches, dedicated to <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Moldavia%20and%20Bukovina">Moldavian Orthodoxy</a>, in both localities. He purchased Arbore, including the present-day city of <a href="Solca">Solca</a> and communes of <a href="Boto%C8%99ana">Botoșana</a> and <a href="Iaslov%C4%83%C8%9B">Iaslovăț</a>, in March 1502, developing it into his main "<a href="demesne">demesne</a>"—favored, with Șipote, because it was closest Stephen's preferred courts (Suceava and <a href="H%C3%A2rl%C4%83u">Hârlău</a>). Folklore records that Arbore used Polish and Ottoman prisoners of war as his laborers, forcing them to quarry stone from <a href="Solca%20River">Solca River</a>. From his mother Nastasia, the gatekeeper also inherited the <a href="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a>n village of <a href="Hiliu%C8%9Bi%2C%20R%C3%AE%C8%99cani">Hilăuți</a>. Tradition further attributes him ownership of <a href="Fete%C8%99ti%2C%20Edine%C8%9B">Hrițeni</a>, in northern Bessarabia.

Arbore married a lady Iuliana. One account suggests that she was the daughter of "<a href="comis">comis</a>" Petru Ezăreanul of <a href="Tutova%20County">Tutova County</a>, also killed in the war of 1475; this remains disputed. They had at least four male children: Toader, Nichita, and Gliga, and Ioan, the latter of whom did not survive into adulthood. Some records attest a fifth son, Rubeo Arbore. Of his seven daughters, Ana married the great "comis" Pintilie Plaxa. Another daughter, Marica, was the mother of Marica Solomon, wife of the "vistier" Solomon. Finally, a daughter Sofiica was traditionally believed the wife of a great "<a href="vistier">vistier</a>", Gavril Totrușan (or Trotușan). Later researchers asserted that her husband was another "vistier", Gavril Misici. However, according to scholar Adrian Vătămanu, she may have been Totrușan's second wife, and Totrușan himself may have been a Misici. Arbore also had a nephew, Dragoș, whom he groomed for the office of Suceava gatekeeper and to whom he donated an estate in Țăpești.

As a diplomat, Arbore carried out several diplomatic missions in Poland and the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Moscow">Grand Duchy of Moscow</a>. Historian Valentina Eșanu believes that Arbore is "Luka voloshanin" or "Luca walachus" ("Luca the Vlach"), mentioned by several sources as leading Stephen's embassies to these two countries. This would mean that in 1496–1497 he accompanied the Muscovite envoy Ivan Oscherin, who was traveling back and forth between Moscow and Moldavia. This mission was part of a series of high-level contacts between Moldavia, Moscow, and <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, persuading Alexander Jagiellon, who was only <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duke of Lithuania</a> at the time, to withdraw from an alliance with Poland. 

In 1497, as Poland invaded Moldavia and besieged Suceava, Arbore reportedly organized a "heroic defense" of the capital. The events at the brought Arbore into direct contact with the <a href="King%20of%20Poland">Polish king</a>, <a href="John%20I%20Albert">John I Albert</a>, as mentioned years later by Albert's brother, <a href="Alexander%20Jagiellon">Alexander Jagiellon</a>. Alexander's letter also confirms that Albert viewed Arbore as a possible contender for the Moldavian throne; in a different chronicle, the defenders are said to given the following reply to Albert: "Know that we will not betray our lord and his castles to you, for our lord, Prince Stephen, is in the field with his army; if you so desire, go and defeat him, and then his castles and the entire country will be yours." The same chronicle describes a meeting between Albert and Arbore outside the castle walls, a few days into the siege. Albert, thinking that Arbore might have princely aspirations, proposed to the gatekeeper that he handle him Suceava and receive support for obtaining the throne. Arbore refused; Albert then tried to capture Arbore, but the latter managed to retreat into the citadel.

Prominence.
In late 1497, the itinerant Oscherin and "Luka voloshanin" were robbed in <a href="Terebovlia">Terebovlia</a> by a band of <a href="Crimean%20Khanate">Crimeans</a> and <a href="Cossacks">Cossacks</a>, allegedly led by Prince Yapancha. The incident prompted Stephen to demand reparations from <a href="Me%C3%B1li%20I%20Giray">Meñli I Giray</a>, but these were never fully returned. In 1501, as tensions between Poland and Moldavia were being reignited, Arbore traveled to <a href="Halych">Halych</a> and informed the local "<a href="starosta">starosta</a>" that Moldavia intended to annex that city, and possibly other parts of the <a href="Ruthenian%20Voivodeship">Ruthenian Voivodeship</a> as well. It is however not known if the visit was an official diplomatic mission or Arbore's own initiative. That year, a number of Muscovite envoys were detained in Moldavia by Stephen, who wanted safety guarantees for his daughter <a href="Elena%20of%20Moldavia">Olena</a>, imprisoned alongside his grandson <a href="Dmitry%20Ivanovich%20%28grandson%20of%20Ivan%20III%29">Dmitry</a>. The diplomats were released in June 1502, and accompanied back to Moscow by the Moldavians "Doma" and "Ulyuka"—according to Eșanu, these may be boyars Duma Burdur, or Duma Vlaiculovici, and Arbore. 

In the fall of 1502, although Alexander Jagiellon had taken the Polish throne from his brother, Poland and Moldavia were again at odds with each other. In that context, Arbore had a prominent role in the occupation of Polish region of <a href="Pokuttya">Pokuttya</a>. He ordered his own tombstone at around the same time, possibly as a precaution. During the campaign, Arbore again met the "starosta" of Halych, who asked him about the destruction of a castle by the Moldavians. Arbore gave a firm reply, meant to be heard by Alexander Jagiellon—it suggested that his lord, Stephen III, did not wish to have any castles near his border, save the castle of Halych. If the identification of "Luca walachus" is correct, in November 1503 Arbore also led a Moldavian delegation to <a href="Lublin">Lublin</a>, trying to reach an understanding over Stephen's annexation of Pokuttya. 

Arbore was also integrated on the <a href="Sfatul%20boieresc">Boyar Council</a> in 1486, but only returned there in 1498, possibly because he was too often absent from the country on diplomatic assignments. According to historian Virgil Pâslariuc, he was co-opted there because he supported Stephen's co-ruler and designated successor, <a href="Bogdan%20III%20the%20One-Eyed">Bogdan III</a>, whose claim to the throne was contested by his brothers; and also because he was a distinguished warrior. During the final years of Stephen III's reign, Arbore and <a href="Ioan%20T%C4%83utu">Ioan Tăutu</a> became increasingly influential, taking on more and more attributes; by 1503, Arbore had also risen through the Boyar Council, being listed there as the eighth most important boyar. For a while, he was the country's "<a href="spatharios">spatharios</a>", or military commander.

In 1504, with Stephen III dead, Arbore was allegedly a pretender to the throne, although he continued to serve as courtier of the recognized successor, Bogdan. This account, contested by several historians, is based on Alexander Jagiellon's letter, which also claims that Arbore narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. According to <a href="Nicolae%20Iorga">Nicolae Iorga</a>, the whole episode, as narrated by the source, is "hard to believe" and "confusing". In 2013, Liviu Pilat argued that the whole controversy about Arbore's claim to the throne stems from a misreading of Alexander's letter, which refers only to the events of 1497. Pâslariuc proposes that Bogdan used Arbore, his loyalist and mentor, to solidify his legitimacy. He also notes that Bogdan punished his nephew Dragoș, who had "ruined a very expensive cannon", by confiscating one of his estates. This was an example of the prince "confronting the great families", with which he was otherwise at peace.

Arbore led troops in combat during the new Moldavian–Polish clashes of 1505, prompted by the failed marriage arrangements between Bogdan and Elizabeth Jagiellon. Reportedly, he was present at the Moldavian sieges of <a href="Kamianets-Podilskyi">Kamianets</a> and <a href="Lviv">Lviv</a>. The Poles responded twice, anticipating Arbore's counterattacks and defeating the Moldavian troops on both occasions, which prompted Bogdan to sue for peace. Some of Arbore's other work concentrated on erecting the church of Arbore, which was finished in 1502, and to which he donated an "<a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>" in 1507. The frescoes, completed in 1504, are a synthesis of <a href="Renaissance%20art">Renaissance</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine art</a>, noted for the usage of <a href="Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> and <a href="Bogomilism">Bogomil</a> symbols in an otherwise Orthodox context. Church historian Mircea Pahomi advances the hypothesis that Arbore used Italian stonemasons and painters for at least some of this work. His and his wife's coats of arms, displayed on the central shrine, are among the very few examples of classical Moldavian heraldry.

Regency and downfall.
Bogdan was an ailing prince, incapable of fulfilling his duties toward the end of his life; alongside Totrușan, Arbore again took hold of the actual government. The throne went to <a href="Stephen%20IV%20of%20Moldavia">Stephen IV</a>, a minor (11-years-old at the time). Arbore became the ruler's tutor and, as such, the country's "<a href="%C3%A9minence%20grise">éminence grise</a>". His estate increased in 1516 with the purchase of <a href="Todire%C8%99ti%2C%20Suceava">Soloneț</a> from the boyars Hanco, eventually comprising 39 separate domains, including Mount Giumalău. Arbore held the office of gatekeeper to March 15 (March 25), 1523; he is also listed as a "<a href="hetman">hetman</a>" by the chronicler Macarie, but, Eșanu writes, this office had not yet been introduced at the Moldavian court. Similarly, Pahomi notes that the title of "hetman" is "wrongly applied" to Arbore, who never held it.

During this interlude, Moldavia's foreign policy shifted, and Stephen signed an alliance with the new Polish monarch, <a href="Sigismund%20I%20the%20Old">Sigismund I</a>. Arbore, identified by medievalist Ilie Grămadă as the leader of a Polonophile party, negotiated advantageous terms: until Polish troops had entered her territory and provided for her security, Moldavia was not required to either assist Poland or cease paying her debts to the Ottoman Empire. Overall, his policy on the Ottoman issue is described by scholar Pahomi, Mircea as "active neutrality". Nonetheless, the policy change, which opened the way for Moldavia's participation in a planned crusade organized jointly by the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">Kingdom of France</a>, upset Moldavia's relations with the Ottomans and the Crimeans. In August 1518, <a href="Mehmed%20I%20Giray">Mehmed I Giray</a> sent Crimean troops into Moldavia. These were met outside <a href="%C8%98tef%C4%83ne%C8%99ti%2C%20Boto%C8%99ani">Ștefănești</a> by a well-prepared Moldavian force, led by Arbore; there, Mehmed suffered a massive defeat, with many of his troops drowning in the <a href="Prut%20River">Prut River</a>.

Military historian Mihai Adauge describes Arbore as a "great strategist" and "fearless patriot", on par with Stephen III. Nevertheless, by 1523 the Arbore males had encountered his prince's wrath, being formally charged with "hiclenie" (treason). The parish chronicle of Solca noted in the 1880s that "no Moldavian chronicle" specified what crime Arbore had actually committed. As read by Pahomi, the prince's decision reflected cleavages within the Council, inherently linked with the Polish–Ottoman issue. The "old boyars" fell out of favor; a "<a href="postelnic">postelnic</a>" Cozma Șarpe Gănescu, confronted with similar charges, escaped to Poland. According to Vătămanu, Stephen IV was angered that Sigismund's court still hosted pretenders to the Moldavian crown. Although Arbore may have agreed with the prince on this point, and also favored a disengagement from the Polish alliance, "it appears that the Polish emissaries would not let him."

Luca was decapitated in April at the princely court in <a href="H%C3%A2rl%C4%83u">Hârlău</a>. Toader and Nichita Arbore were reportedly put to death, by strangling or decapitation, during the following month. According to one tradition, one of them may have actually been dead by that time, accidentally killed during a hunting trip. The family residence at Arbore–Solca was confiscated by the ruler, and became state land. Arbore's grave remains undiscovered, but one theory is that his body was stolen by his partisans and secretly buried at Solca.

The execution episode is credited with sparking a boyar revolt, which happened in September 1523. Grămadă also notes that Arbore's death signaled another foreign policy change, with Poland fearing a Moldavian–Ottoman <a href="rapprochement">rapprochement</a>—despite the Moldavian–Ottoman clash at <a href="Tarasivtsi">Tărăsăuți</a>. The prince, who maintained hold of the country while at war with Polish-aligned boyars and <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>, appointed a new administration, comprising Totrușan, and, as the new gatekeeper of Suceava, the boyar Petrică. Totrușan is nevertheless listed among the boyars who took up arms, supporting the pretender <a href="Alexandru%20Cornea">Alexandru Cornea</a>. The movement was finally repressed in blood. Much of the old elite was forced into exile, with some captives executed by the prince at his residence in <a href="Roman%2C%20Romania">Roman</a>.

Luca's wife Iuliana had probably died before 1523. Rubeo Arbore, allegedly one of her two surviving sons, took hold of two Moldavian <a href="Bombard%20%28weapon%29">bombards</a> and surrendered with them to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281301%E2%80%931526%29">Kingdom of Hungary</a>; his sister Sofiica and her husband Gavril also left the country, settling in Poland. Gliga Arbore disappeared from records at a later date. According to various researchers, he fled into Lithuania, possibly as late as 1545. Genealogist <a href="Octav-George%20Lecca">Octav-George Lecca</a> argues that the fugitive was another Gliga Arbore, collaterally related to Luca, and describes the flight as an eloping to Poland with two nuns. The Arbore family survived through Luca's female descendants and, according to Lecca, also other close relatives. Daughter Ana Plaxa recovered possession of the Arbore manor in circa 1541, when <a href="Petru%20Rare%C8%99">Petru Rareș</a> had taken the Moldavian throne. She commissioned master Dragosin Coman to repaint the manorial church, which had been damaged by an Ottoman invasion in 1538, and, dying childless, bequeathed the place to her niece Parasca Udrea. A granddaughter, Anghelina, married a diplomat of Princes Rareș and <a href="Iacob%20Heraclid">Iacob Heraclid</a>, Avram Banilovschi. A Mihu Arbore was recorded as "hetman" during the reign of Rareș; in 1538, he changed sides and offered his support to <a href="Stephen%20V%20of%20Moldavia">Stephen V "Locust"</a>, only to take part in a conspiracy against the latter that ended with the prince being assassinated in Suceava.

Legacy.
Arbore survivals.
The Udreas, acting as Arbore successors, obtained other parts of the Solca estate in 1555. However, the then-ruler of Moldavia, <a href="Alexandru%20L%C4%83pu%C8%99neanu">Alexandru Lăpușneanu</a>, staged another clampdown against the high-ranking boyars, and Plaxa possibly died during the events. Marica Solomon was still alive in 1583, when she had withdrawn to a convent; she and Grigore Udrea fought over various family assets, with Udrea formally accused of forgery. Ana Plaxa, also a nun, was cared for by the Udrea family. By 1598, the dispute had been settled in favor of the Udreas, who then sold their land in Solca to the <a href="Movile%C8%99ti">Movilești</a> family, which transferred it to <a href="Sucevi%C8%9Ba%20Monastery">Sucevița Monastery</a>. The Solomons received as compensation the fief of <a href="Cornu%20Luncii">Stănilești</a>.

At least from 1606, the Ponici family of Bessarabia was also registered as descending from one of Luca Arbore's daughters, Stanca. This branch intermarried with the descendants of gatekeeper Petrică, which included Prince <a href="%C8%98tefan%20Petriceicu">Ștefan Petriceicu</a>. The Udrea inheritance went to a Toader Murguleț, who supported dowager princess <a href="Elisabeta%20Movil%C4%83">Elisabeta Movilă</a> in her war with <a href="%C8%98tefan%20Tom%C8%99a">Ștefan Tomșa</a>. When the latter took the throne, he confiscated Solca and donated it to the eponymous monastery. In 1620 Luca's reported heirs included his daughter Marica's daughters (or granddaughters), Tofana and Zamfira, and Anghelina's daughter, Nastasia. They tried but failed to secure ownership of Solca, remained in the care of Solca Monastery. By 1644, another one of Luca's great-graddaughters, Magda, was married to Onciu Vrânceanu, the "vistier" of Prince <a href="Vasile%20Lupu">Vasile Lupu</a>.

The core estates of Arbore and Solca were reportedly first devastated by various raids in the 17th century, in particular by Tomșa's civil war and the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Ottoman%20War%20%281683%E2%80%9399%29">Polish expedition of 1683</a>. The area fell under the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Bukovina">Duchy of Bukovina</a>, part of the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>, in 1775. The new administration passed the core Solca estate into a church land fund, then rented it, cementing its designation as Arbore (also Arbure or Arbura). The locality became a target for German immigration from <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. By 1860, the manor had been looted and vandalized, with some of its discarded masonry used for a <a href="Belfry%20%28architecture%29">belfry</a> (a feature not present in the original building); the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Moldavia">coat of arms of Moldavia</a>, displayed on its walls, was covered with <a href="Mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a>. The cellar and tunnel still survived, and were used as a hideout by the "<a href="haiduc">haiduc</a>" Darie Pomohaci.

An incomplete inscription suggests that some Arbores had by then settled in Poland, and were serving in the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Commonwealth Army</a> early in the 18th century. Historian Alexandru Furtună also proposes that, by 1746, some Arbores had merged with a branch of the <a href="Cantacuzino%20family">Cantacuzino family</a> and with the boyar clans of Bantăș and Prăjescu. That year, the other three families divided Hilăuți into respective fiefs. As Lecca notes, those who still bore the Arbore surname descended the social ladder, becoming free peasants or burghers by 1700—although, a century later, a Dumitru Arbore was attested with the rank of "<a href="paharnic">paharnic</a>". His two daughters married respectively into the <a href="Kog%C4%83lniceanu%20family">Kogălniceanu family</a> and the Ralli clan. The scholar and revolutionary <a href="Zamfir%20Arbore">Zamfir Ralli</a> inherited the surname "Arbore" from a relative that had been adopted by that family, and which may descend from the 16th-century gatekeeper. Pâslariuc noted, in 1997, that "the name of the Arbure family lives on to this day."

In culture.
Various posthumous sources maintained a respectful image of the alleged rebel. The Polish chronicler <a href="Bernard%20Wapowski">Bernard Wapowski</a> described him as a "strong and great man". According to art historian Emil Dragnev, the <a href="Saint%20John%20the%20New%20Monastery">Suceava Church of Saint George</a>, painted during the rule of Stephen's half-brother and successor Petru Rareș, may give clues that Arbore's execution was already seen as a serious transgression. The frescoes give a usually prominent role to <a href="Naboth">Naboth</a>, falsely accused and murdered by the unjust <a href="Ahab">Ahab</a>. Of the Moldavian chroniclers which covered the event, Macarie, an official historian, was blunt in "never giving hint that there was something unjust about [Arbore's execution]"; writing much later, the Polonophile boyar <a href="Grigore%20Ureche">Grigore Ureche</a> hinted that the prince had been flattered and misled by Arbore's personal enemies. Ureche also argues that Luca was not put on trial for the accusations made against him, nor were any of the claims proven, although, according to Dragnev, Ureche's own claim is not necessarily backed by evidence. 

In 19th-century Moldavia and the successor <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Kingdom of Romania</a>, Arbore was also recovered by literature, appearing early on as an heroic figure in <a href="Constantin%20Stamati">Constantin Stamati</a>'s poem, "Santinela", and being portrayed in prose works by <a href="Constantin%20Negruzzi">Constantin Negruzzi</a>. In the 1860s, the Bessarabian <a href="Bogdan%20Petriceicu%20Hasdeu">Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu</a> made him a key figure in the novella "Ursita", loosely based on the conflict between Stephen IV and Șarpe Gănescu. Here, Arbore is shown advising Șarpe to flee the country, and is then imprisoned as revenge. Another episode shows Arbore and Stephen III chatting about <a href="Renaissance%20magic">Renaissance magic</a>. Hasdeu also began writing a novel "Arbore", which he never finished. During that period, <a href="Mihai%20Eminescu">Mihai Eminescu</a> sketched the novel "Mira", named after a fictional daughter of the gatekeeper. Arbore himself is present in the work, standing for the "glorious past" of Stephen III's reign, against the decadence of Stephen IV. Stephen IV falls in love with Mira, but eventually kills her father.

Published a generation later, the play "<a href="Apus%20de%20soare">Apus de soare</a>", by <a href="Barbu%20%C8%98tef%C4%83nescu%20Delavrancea">Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea</a>, also has Arbore for a main protagonist. In Delavrancea's subsequent work, "<a href="Viforul">Viforul</a>", Arbore is again the central figure—although, according to critic <a href="Eugen%20Lovinescu">Eugen Lovinescu</a>, his presence is superfluous, epic rather than dramatic. Arbore's alleged scheme is taken for granted by the dramatist, and depicted as a grave error of judgement. The hunting trip episode is depicted as an early stage in the conflict between the prince and the gatekeeper, leading to the deliberate murder of Arbore junior, here named Cătălin.

The Ureche account was repeated by the Bukovina Minister <a href="Ion%20Nistor">Ion Nistor</a> during the 1924 commemoration of Arbore's death—six years after Bukovina's integration into <a href="Greater%20Romania">Greater Romania</a>. Nistor added that Arbore was a "clean soul" and "true martyr" of the <a href="Romanian%20Orthodox%20Church">Romanian Orthodox Church</a>, before whom Moldavians knelt. As argued in 2001 by scholar <a href="Lucian%20Boia">Lucian Boia</a>, Arbore's treatment in Romanian historiography went through two distinct phases. Before the onset of <a href="Communist%20Romania">Romanian communism</a>, historians generally described as his execution as "unjustified", and listed it as one of Stephen IV's shortcomings. During communism, the prince was lauded for his dealing with "the betrayers of the country". Restored at later intervals, the Arbore church is, as of 2014, one of eight <a href="Churches%20of%20Moldavia">Moldavian churches</a> on the <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Romania">UNESCO World Heritage list</a>.

SymPulse is a trademark of <a href="Klick%20Health">Klick Health</a>. SymPulse is a technology solution that represents the class of devices that performs digital symptom transference for the purpose of building empathy for a physiological condition. The concept of eliciting empathy for a disease or symptom in someone that does not suffer that condition is known as <a href="tele-empathy">tele-empathy</a>.

<a href="Clinical%20empathy">Clinical empathy</a> has long been known to be an important factor affecting patient outcome and the goal of SymPulse tele-empathy devices is to use technology to accurately sense, digitize and characterize symptoms in patients and also use different technologies to generate a physiological response in a non-patient.

Operating Principle.
The process involves identifying a symptom of a disease and using various technologies to sense and digitize the condition. This data is then used in conjunction with other technologies to elicit a physiological response representative of the symptom.    

Implementations.
Parkinson's disease / Movement disorders.
Muscle activity data is collected from a Parkinson’s disease patient’s forearm and signal analysis is performed on the time series waveforms to extract and characterize the underlying tremor. Muscle stimulation technology is then used to generate sequences of impulses that stimulate muscles in a non-patient’s forearm. The patent-pending experiential device induces involuntary muscle activity, which mimics patient tremors and enables physicians and caregivers to experience the difficulties of seemingly simple tasks, such as buttoning a shirt or using a mobile phone.    

COPD.
The SymPulse COPD tele-empathy device aids in generating empathy for patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. The patent-pending experiential device dynamically restricts the amount of air a person can inhale to mimic the debilitating symptoms a patient suffers such as shallowness of breath.

Assassination of Airey Neave

On the 30 March 1979, the <a href="Ireland">Irish</a> <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a> <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> group the <a href="Irish%20National%20Liberation%20Army">Irish National Liberation Army</a> (INLA) killed the then <a href="Shadow%20Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland">Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland</a> <a href="Airey%20Neave">Airey Neave</a> when a INLA unit placed a magnetic <a href="car%20bomb">car bomb</a> fitted with a ball bearing <a href="Mercury%20switch">tilt-switch</a> under his new <a href="Vauxhall%20Cavalier">Vauxhall Cavalier</a> under the drivers seat which exploded at 14:58 as Neave drove out of the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> car park. 

Background.
The INLA and their political wing the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Socialist%20Party">Irish Republican Socialist Party</a> (IRSP) were formed at a meeting in a <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> hotel in December 1974. The meeting was headed by <a href="Seamus%20Costello">Seamus Costello</a> who became the first INLA <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff">Chief of Staff</a>. 

In 1975 the INLA began carrying out attacks on British security forces using the name the "People's Liberation Army" and they also used the name "Armagh People's Republican Army".

The assassination took place at a time of heightened tensions and violence during the <a href="The%20Troubles">Northern Irish conflict</a> after two years of decreasing violence in 1977 and 1978.
In February 1979 a former prison officer and his wife were killed by the <a href="Provisional%20IRA">Provisional IRA</a> in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>. On 22 March the IRA killed the British Ambassador to the Netherlands <a href="Richard%20Sykes">Richard Sykes</a> and his <a href="Dutch%20people">Dutch</a> valet in a gun attack in <a href="Den%20Haag">Den Haag</a> in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. On the same day the IRA carried out 24 bombings all across <a href="Nothern%20Ireland">Nothern Ireland</a>.

The Attack.
For several years Neave had been advocating for a strong security response to counter the growing Republican paramilitaries <a href="insurgency">insurgency</a> campaign. This brought him to the attention of the IRA and INLA. 
A member of the INLA GHQ said in a 1993 interview
""He was coming in on the heels of Mason-to settle the Northern problem and make Mason look like a lamb. He wanted to bring in more SAS and take the war to the enemy"" 
Neave's increasing hardline rhetoric made him a target of <a href="Irish%20Republican">Irish Republican</a> paramilitaries.

After <a href="James%20Callaghan">James Callaghan</a>'s Labour government was defeated on a vote of no confidence on 28 March 1979 it was likely Neave would have become <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland">Secretary of State for Northern Ireland</a> under a conservative government. 

According to <a href="Jack%20Holland%20%28writer%29">Jack Holland</a> & <a href="Henry%20McDonald%20%28writer%29">Henry McDonald</a> in their 1994 book ""INLA: Deadly Divisions"" a political source in England who feared a right-wing "backlash" from Neave with <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> as his chosen front passed on vital information to the INLA which gave the INLA the access and information they needed to carry out an assassination attempt on Neave. The information they received indicated that access to the Palace of Westminster was possible, but that the bombers would have to be a safe distance away from the scene when the attack occurred, but since they didn't know what time Neave would leave at they couldn't use a <a href="time%20bomb">time bomb</a>. INLA GHQ decided to use a bomb with a mercury-tilt switch attached which would explode when the bomb was at a certain angle.

On Friday 30 March two INLA Volunteers gained entry to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> underground car park posing as workmen carrying the device in a tool box. The INLA team identified Neave's Vauxhall Cavalier and placed the bomb to the floor panel under the drivers seat and armed the device. 

Neave left the House of Commons a few minutes before 15:00. As Neave drove up the ramp that exited the car park the mercury surged, completing the circuit and the 16 ounces of explosives used in the bomb exploded. The force of the blast pushed Neave forward, severed his legs and trapped him in the wrecked car. It took emergency services nearly a half an hour to free Neave from the wreck. He died eight minutes after he arrived at the hospital.

The INLA issued a statement regarding the killing in the August 1979 edition of "<a href="The%20Starry%20Plough%20%28newspaper%29">The Starry Plough</a>":

Aftermath.
The violence continued to surge to heights in Northern Ireland not seen since 1976 as both the IRA & the INLA intensified their military campaigns. 
Less than a month after Neave was killed 4 officers of the <a href="Royal%20Ulster%20Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> (RUC) were killed in a <a href="Improvised%20explosive%20device">Roadside bomb</a> attack during the <a href="1979%20Bessbrook%20bombing">1979 Bessbrook bombing</a>. The day before the Bessbrook attack a prison officers was shot dead by the IRA in <a href="Clogher">Clogher</a> <a href="County%20Tyrone">Tyrone</a> Two days after the Bessbrook attack, a female prison officer was killed and 3 others injured in a gun & grenade attack carried out by the INLA outside <a href="Armagh">Armagh</a> Women's prison, the attack was led by <a href="Dessie%20Grew">Dessie Grew</a> the OC of the INLA's Armagh brigade. On the same day a <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> soldier was shot dead in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> a few hours later this time by the IRA.
On the 27 July the INLA killed an ex RUC officer using the same method they did to kill Airey Neave by placing a <a href="booby%20trap">booby trap</a> bomb under the RUC mans car, the mans 21 year old daughter was badly injured in the attack. Four days later on 31 July the INLA shot dead an RUC <a href="Constable">Constable</a> outside Armagh courthouse.
On 2 August the IRA killed two British soldiers in a <a href="landmine">landmine</a> attack in Armagh and later shot a RUC officer dead in Belfast.
On 9 August INLA Volunteers seriously wounded two British soldiers from sniper attacks in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, the attacks were were carried out by the INLA's Belfast Brigade.

On the 27 August 1979, 18 British soldiers were killed and 6 others injured & 1 <a href="English%20people">English</a> civilian was shot dead by the British Army who also injured a second civilian as they fired shots across the Irish border at who they taught were IRA Volunteers during the <a href="Warrenpoint%20ambush">Warrenpoint ambush</a> which was the British Army's biggest loss during the 38 years they spent in Northern Ireland as part of <a href="Operation%20Banner">Operation Banner</a>. On the same day <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a> and three others were on a boat of the <a href="Sligo">Sligo</a> coast, the IRA had placed a 1,000 lb bomb under the boat the night before. When the boat went far enough out the IRA exploded the bomb by <a href="remote%20control">remote control</a> killing <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a> and three other civilians on the boat. This brought the total casualties for the 27 August to: 23 dead and 7 injured which was a very high death toll for one day in the low-intensity <a href="guerilla">guerilla</a> conflict being fought in Ireland at the time, the only other higher death tolls on a single day were the 1998 <a href="Omagh%20bombing">Omagh bombing</a> (29 killed) and 1974 <a href="Dublin%20and%20Monaghan%20bombings">Dublin and Monaghan bombings</a> (34 Killed).

A year after Neave's death in October 1980, the Chief of Staff of the INLA <a href="Ronnie%20Bunting">Ronnie Bunting</a> & another INLA member Noel Lyttle were shot dead in a house in the Turf Lodge area of Belfast. The <a href="Ulster%20Freedom%20Fighters">Ulster Freedom Fighters</a> claimed responsibility for the killings.

Invited to "<a href="Iskra%20%28magazine%29">Iskra</a>" by <a href="Nikolai%20Kurochkin">Nikolai Kurochkin</a>, Zhulev debuted as published author in 1860 to become a regular and prolific contributor to this magazine, as well as "<a href="Budilnik">Budilnik</a>", "<a href="Peterburgskaya%20Gazeta">Peterburgskaya Gazeta</a>", "<a href="Peterburgsky%20Listok">Peterburgsky Listok</a>" and "Strekoza" (in which he edited the poetry section), using pen names, like Skorbny Poet (Mournful Poet), Debutante, and Gus (Goose). Zhulev released two collections of poetry, which he compiled himself, "Pesni Skorbnogo poeta" (Songs of the Mournful Poet, 1863) and "Bah! Znakomuye vse litsa!" (Bah! All Familiar Faces, 1871), the former having been favourably (even if very briefly) reviewed by <a href="Saltykov-Shchedrin">Saltykov-Shchedrin</a>. "The Poverty, which merrily mocks itself and laughs whole-heartedly at the rich man's obnoxiousness... is Mournful Poet's major motif," the "Iskra" preface read. Zhulev co-authored a dozen plays, with Ivan Chernyshov, Alexander Sokolov, <a href="Nikolai%20Leykin">Nikolai Leykin</a> and Sergey Khudekov. Mostly vaudevilles, they have been produced on stage, enjoyed some success but were ignored by critics.

Pannaway Plantation

Pannaway Plantation was the first <a href="Demographics%20of%20Europe">European</a> settlement in what is now currently the state of <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>. By 1630, the Plantation was abandoned and the settelers moved to <a href="Strawberry%20Banke">Strawberry Banke</a> in what is now known as <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Portsmouth</a>.

History.
Pannaway is an <a href="Abenaki">Abenaki</a> word likely to mean ""place where the water spreads out"". When <a href="John%20Mason%20%28governor%29">John Mason</a> was granted a colony to start in <a href="British%20America">British America</a>, he was granted the land from south on up to where the <a href="Piscataqua%20River">Piscataqua River</a> flows into the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, while <a href="Ferdinando%20Gorges">Ferdinando Gorges</a> claimed the land north of the river, that colony ended up becoming <a href="Maine">Maine</a>. The first settler to go into Pannaway Plantation was <a href="David%20Thomson">David Thomson</a>. He had his family come to the plantation. He was granted six thousand acres of land in the new world when he arrived. 10 other men went with him to settle the land and he himself gave the name to the plantation after hearing it from a Indian who guided him. In his first year here, he was greeted by Captain <a href="Myles%20Standish">Myles Standish</a> of the <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth Colony</a> who was looking for aid at the time.

[[Christopher Levett in his 1623 "Voyage to New England" states that he spent a month here. In July of 1623, [[Thomas Weston]] of the [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]] Colony was shipwrecked off of todays [[North Hampton, New Hampshire|North Hampton]]. He was tortured by the Natives who stripped him of his clothing and he ran away barely escaping death. He ended up making it to Pannaway to shelter. In 1626, Thomson left Pannaway and left for an island in the Boston Harbor. Tomson later died within the next couple years as his wife later marries [[Samuel Maverick]], one of the first slave traders in the colony. By 1630, [[Strawberry Banke]] was proven to be more secure of a location from the Indians and the settler [[Walter Neale]] invited them to come in. The Plantation was later abandoned. Today the location of the Plantation is in today's [[Odiorne Point State Park]].

Henry Irving Dodge

Henry Irving Dodge (April 11, 1861 - July 28, 1934) was an American writer. He was best known for creating the character "Skinner" which appeared in "Skinner's Dress Suit" and a number of additional stories in the 1910s. 

Dodge was a great-nephew of <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a> and grandson of Major General Richard Henry Dodge who fought in the American Revolution and War of 1812. He was born in <a href="Oswego%20County%2C%20New%20York">Oswego County, New York</a>. He studied engineering and law, but preferred writing, and worked for newspapers and magazines.

In 1916, his story "Skinner's Dress Suit" was published in "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>", featuring the character William Manning Skinner, and he continued writing Skinner stories to meet public demand, including "Skinner's Baby", "Skinner's Big Idea", and "Skinner Makes It Fashionable" in 1920. A few "Skinner" films based on his works were made in the 1910s and 1920s, e.g., "<a href="Skinner%27s%20Baby">Skinner's Baby</a>" (1917) and "Skinner's Dress Suit" (both in 1917 and <a href="Skinner%27s%20Dress%20Suit">1926</a>).

<doc id="54734615" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54734615" title="Nephromyces">
Nephromyces

Nephromyces is a genus of <a href="apicomplexa">apicomplexa</a>ns that are symbionts of the <a href="Ascidiacea">ascidian</a> genus "<a href="Molgula">Molgula</a>" (sea grapes).

Systematics.
"Nephromyces" was first described in 1888 by <a href="Alfred%20Mathieu%20Giard">Alfred Mathieu Giard</a> as a <a href="Chytridiomycota">chytrid fungus</a>, because of its filamentous cells. He formally named three species, each corresponding to a different species of the host animal. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular phylogenetics</a> later showed that "Nephromyces" are not actually fungi, but instead constitute a group within the <a href="Apicomplexa">Apicomplexa</a> that is related to the <a href="Piroplasmida">Piroplasmida</a>.


Description.
"Nephromyces" is found in the lumen of the renal sac of its host animals. The renal sac is a closed, fluid-filled structure that is derived from the <a href="epicardium">epicardium</a> during development. There are different cell types (at least seven in "Nephromyces" from "<a href="Molgula%20manhattensis">Molgula manhattensis</a>") which appear to be different life cycle stages, as the different types appear in a consistent sequence after initial infection of the host animal. However, in a mature infection, different stages simultaneously co-occur in the same host individual. They include filaments (trophic stages), spores, motile but non-flagellated cells, and biflagellated swarmer cells. The non-flagellated motile cells resemble the <a href="Apicomplexan%20life%20cycle">sporozoites</a> of other apicomplexans, while the spores contain structures that resemble the rhoptries of the <a href="apical%20complex">apical complex</a>, another typical apicomplexan feature.

Symbiosis.
"Nephromyces" is specific to the family <a href="Molgulidae">Molgulidae</a>, and has been found in species of "<a href="Molgula">Molgula</a>" and at least one other molgulid genus, "<a href="Bostrichobranchus">Bostrichobranchus</a>" ("B. pilularis"). Every wild-collected adult "Molgula" animal examined has been found to contain "Nephromyces", suggesting that it is a beneficial symbiont rather than a parasite; this makes "Nephromyces" an exception among apicomplexans, which are usually parasitic on their animal hosts. However, animals without "Nephromyces" can be obtained by spawning and raising them in filtered seawater. These symbiont-free animals have been used to study the "Nephromyces" life cycle. "Nephromyces" is released into surrounding seawater when its host dies, and cells of "Nephromyces" can remain alive and infective for at least 29 days outside of a host.

The renal sac organ where "Nephromyces" lives contains high concentrations of <a href="Uric%20acid">urate</a>, a nitrogenous waste product. Activity of <a href="urate%20oxidase">urate oxidase</a>, an enzyme that breaks down urate, has been found in "Nephromyces" cells, hence they may be using the waste products from their host animal as a nitrogen source for themselves.

Intracellular bacteria have been found within cells of "Nephromyces" from "<a href="Molgula%20manhattensis">Molgula manhattensis</a>" and "<a href="Molgula%20occidentalis">M. occidentalis</a>", making this a symbiosis within a symbiosis.

Elizabeth Wade White

Elizabeth Wade White (June 8, 1906 – December 11, 1994) was an American author, poet and activist. She was a lover of <a href="Valentine%20Ackland">Valentine Ackland</a> and wrote "The Life of <a href="Anne%20Bradstreet">Anne Bradstreet</a>: The Tenth Muse", about an early American poet and first American writer to be published in the then colonies.

Early life.
Elizabeth Wade White was born at 107 Prospect Street, <a href="Waterbury%2C%20Connecticut">Waterbury, Connecticut</a>, the first child of William Henry White (1876-1952) and Mary Elizabeth Wade (1878-1949). She had one brother, Henry Wade White (1909-1995). Her paternal grandfather was George Luther White (1852-1914), one of the American leading paper box manufacturers, stockholder of White & Wells and L.C. White Co. His estate amounted to half a million dollars which, at the time of his wife's death, Julia Phelps Haring (1852-1928), became $1.67 million. Her maternal grandfather was Henry Lawton Wade (1842-1912), a stockholder of the <a href="Timex%20Group%20USA">Waterbury Clock Company</a> who left $1.75 million to his two daughters, Lucy and Mary, Elizabeth's mother. Both Wade and White families descended from the <a href="Puritan%20migration%20to%20New%20England%20%281620%E2%80%9340%29">Puritans</a> migrated to New England in the 1630s.

The Whites were well-off and other than the Prospect Street house they owned a country house at Breakneck Hill, <a href="Middlebury%2C%20Connecticut">Middlebury, Connecticut</a> (overlooking Waterbury, only 6 miles from Prospect Street), and another house at Bass Rocks, <a href="Gloucester%2C%20Massachusetts">Gloucester, Massachusetts</a>. Plus an house and shooting camp in Middleton, South Carolina, Strawberry Hill House, 30 miles north of Savannah, inherited by Henry Wade.

White's early age friends came from his brother's attendance at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>: <a href="George%20Heard%20Hamilton">George Heard Hamilton</a> (1910-2004) (later professor at Yale) and Douglas McKee (1911-1997) (later a teacher at Loomis School, Windsor, Connecticut), both fellow Yale students. 

White attended <a href="Westover%20School">Westover School</a> in Middlebury. White's closest female friend was Katherine Bullock (1908-1995), daughter of Calvin Bullock from Denver, who attended Westover as well. They remained life-long friends and White was often guest at the 18th century houses Bullock's father bought and restored in <a href="Royalston%2C%20Massachusetts">Royalston, Massachusetts</a>. Bullock married Henry P. Cole from Denver, and White was the godmother of their first child.

After graduation, White made her debut into society in December 1925 at a reception given at the Waterbury Club; her dress gown was in white chiffon over silver with white fur trimming. Early in 1927, White attended the Miss Risser's school in Rome together with her cousin, Helen "Henny" Chase Streeter, daughter of <a href="Edward%20Clark%20Streeter">Edward Clark Streeter</a> and Alice Chase, who later married John Bertram Whitelaw. After Rome, White attended school in New York City to study sculpture.

In 1937, White with her brother Henry and their friend, George Hamilton, attended the coronation of <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a>.

Career.
In the 1930s, White supported <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> and his <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> program: she conducted investigations in industrial and mining town to understand the labor conditions there. Her support of Roosevelt was not well seen by her father.

In 1937 White moved to England, in particular in the <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a> county apparently to conduct a research on Anne Bradstreet, an early American poet and first American writer to be published in the then colonies. This was actually an excuse she used with her family cause her real intent was to meet English novelist and poet, <a href="Sylvia%20Townsend%20Warner">Sylvia Townsend Warner</a>, and her partner, <a href="Valentine%20Ackland">Valentine Ackland</a> and to join the <a href="American%20Friends%20Service%20Committee">American Friends Service Committee</a>, a group that was providing relief workers to Spain. Back in Connecticut, White had raised $1180 for the <a href="International%20Brigades">Spanish Medical Aid Committee</a>.

Between 1937 and 1938, White went many times in Spain, while her parents urged her to go back home in the United States.

White rented an house in Dorset and continue to support the Spain's cause, hosting also refugees.

At the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, White went back to the United States, living in New York City and doing volunteering job for the <a href="International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement">American Red Cross</a> as ambulance driver. She also tried to arise awareness in favor of the <a href="Russian%20War%20Relief">Russian War Relief</a>. For her support to the Soviet, White was excluded by her mother's will: Mary's left everything to her son, and White's brother, Henry with the agreement that Henry was to be the manager of her sister's part of inheritance. Henry did not care about his mother's worries, and as soon as possible, he passed the property of the "Patch", the house Mary had inherited from her own mother, and where White was living, to White, as well with her share of money. 

At the end of the 1940s, White joined the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201912%29">Progressive Party</a>, of which she was an active member, was involved in the <a href="Communism">Communism</a> movement, and was a supporter of the 1948 presidential campaign of <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wallace">Henry A. Wallace</a>.

Personal life.
Late in 1938, White had a nervous breakdown and spent the Christmas season at Ackland and Warner's home in Dorset; she later started a relationship with Ackland. In "For Sylvia: An Honest Account" (1949), Ackland tries to explain her affair with White; the relationship was brief, and Ackland spent the rest of her life with Townsend Warner.

White was a supporter of <a href="John%20Craske">John Craske</a>, a painter friend of Ackland. For this reason she was in contact with <a href="Peter%20Pears">Peter Pears</a>, who was collecting Craske's works, and she donated to the Aldeburgh Festival Archive her papers about the artists.

In 1939 White met Evelyn Virginia Holahan (August 28, 1905 - May 27, 1985) and they later shared an apartment in the Greenwich Village. Holahan was originally from <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester, New York</a>, and moved to New York City to work at <a href="Benton%20%26amp%3B%20Bowles">Benton & Bowles</a>, an advertising agency. Holahan's older sister was Elizabeth Holahan, a famous interior decorator with several historical restoration in the New York State to her account; her younger sister was aspiring actress Annie Holahan. She met Ackland in Dorset, where Holahan arrived to retrieve her sister, who had followed <a href="Llewelyn%20Powys">Llewelyn Powys</a>, British novelist and essayist, and Ackland's neighbor, to England. From the correspondence between Holahan and Ackland, it's possible to understand that they had an affair at the time. In May 1939 White accompanied Ackland to the New York pier after a visit, and there White met Holahan. At the end of 1945, White moved back to Middlebury, living at "The Patch", the house her grandmother, Martha Starkweather Wade, left her. With her moved Holahan, who would become her life partner. At the end of the 1940s, Holahan and White founded "White & Holahan, Books", a rare and used book business they run from their home. In 1985 her companion Holahan died and White continued to live at "The Patch" till her own death.

In 1950 White was accepted into the <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Letters">B.Litt.</a> program at <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, even if she did not have an undergraduate degree; she was accepted thanks to the researches she had conducted on Anne Bradstreet. In 1953 White graduated the thesis "The Life of Anne Bradstreet: The Tenth Muse", which she published in 1971. In one of her analysis, White highlights how Bradstreet's poem, "The Prologue", is divided in two parts: at the beginning Bradstreet laments her inferiority to male writer, while at the end she asserts her woman's right to expresse herself.

White died on December 11, 1994 and is buried at Middlebury Cemetery, Middlebury, together with Evelyn Holahan.

Freenom is part of the "OpenTLD B.V". group that is globally active in the field of registering country code top-level domains (<a href="Country%20code%20top-level%20domain">ccTLD</a>), and through its subsidiarys  Dot TK and Dot ML, the company provides <a href="domain%20registration">domain registration</a>, domain monetization and support services.

The <a href="Domain%20name%20registry">registry</a> of Internet <a href=".tk">.tk</a> domain names, registered in the country of <a href="Tokelau">Tokelau</a> in the Pacific Ocean, is currently the largest <a href="Country%20code%20top-level%20domain">ccTLD</a> in the world, and the largest <a href="TLD">TLD</a> after <a href=".com">.com</a>.

Freenom is launched by the founder and current CEO Joost Zuurbier in December 2012.

History.
In 2001, Zuurbier proposed the <a href=".tk">.tk</a> project to the elders of the <a href="Tokelau%20Islands">Tokelau Islands</a>, who, considering the advantage of getting their first <a href="ICT">ICT</a> structure and an innovative open <a href="Country%20code%20top-level%20domain">ccTLD</a> on the Internet, welcomed the proposal.

But only in 2006, after five years from the proposal, <a href="ICANN">ICANN</a> became convinced of the merits of the project, supporting the already favorable position of the elders of the islands. In fact, ICANN initially was skeptical about the legitimacy of the deal and wanted to deepen it, also by meeting the inhabitants, to ensure they were not deceived about their rights as ccTLD. ICANN was very determined to require servers and other infrastructures to be hosted exclusively in Tokelau. They later gave up when they realized how difficult it would be to install servers in the islands and allowed them to install the servers in Amsterdam, at Freenom's headquarters.

In September 2007, Dot TK signed a permanent agreement with Tokelau which annually increases more than 10% of the island's GDP.Then they decided to remove advertisements from all .tk domains, making them free.

They launched in 2011 one of the first DNS <a href="AnyCast">AnyCast</a> cloud structures in the world.

In 2012 they established partnerships with the governments of <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a> and the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>.

In November 2013 Architelos mentions <a href=".tk">.tk</a> as the largest <a href="Country%20code%20top-level%20domain">ccTLD</a> operator in the world with more than 20 million <a href="Domain%20name">domains</a>. 

The company was funded in December 2013 by a group of investors led by <a href="Kima%20Ventures">Kima Ventures</a> (KIMA), with a fund of 3 million dollars.

In October 2014 they established agreements with <a href="Equatorial%20Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a>.

In November 2016 they launched <a href="Freenom%20World">Freenom World</a>, an anonymous and open DNS resolver.

Bongo's Bash is a game where the player is represented as a gorilla in a maze. The maze has a variable number of robots patrolling it and they are looking for the player. In the maze are coconuts the player must collect to exit the level through either the left or right side of the maze. If a robot touches the player, the player loses a life and respawns in the maze. If the player finds a tree, it can be planted anywhere in the maze, and if a robot hits the tree the robot is destroyed. Bonus objects periodically appear in the center (similar to Pac-Man) for extra score points. The game has randomly-generated levels and there is no upper limit to how many levels the player can progress. The game is over when the player loses all lives.

Garrochburn Goods Depot

Garrochburn Goods Depot or Garrochburn Siding was a railway freight facility located off the B744 near the hamlet of Crosshands that lies north-west of <a href="Mauchline">Mauchline</a>, <a href="East%20Ayrshire">East Ayrshire</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. It served the industrial and agricultural requirements for transportation in the vicinity of <a href="Mauchline">Crosshands</a> and the surrounding rural area, originally on behalf of the <a href="Glasgow%20and%20South-Western%20Railway">Glasgow and South-Western Railway</a>. Garrochburn Goods Depot was 40.40 miles from Glasgow, 6.82 from <a href="Kilmarnock">Kilmarnock</a> and 2.72 from <a href="Mauchline">Mauchline</a>. The old <a href="Clachan">clachan</a> of Ladeside once stood nearby and the mill at Dalsangan remains as a private house having lost its water supply upon the draining of <a href="Loch%20Brown">Loch Brown</a> when the railway was built, that is apart from that of the Garroch or Ladeside Burn that cuts under the railway to the south of the old siding. 

Although a remote location today the facility would have had freight transport requirements in the form of such items as lime for the fields, cattle, horse and sheep movements, milk delivery, coal transport movements and related items, etc. with other sidings in the vicinity, namely the line to Mauchline Colliery that opened in 1925 and closed to all traffic in February 1974 after serving as a coal washery for around 5 years after the colliery closed in 1969.

Infrastructure and working.
The <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">OS maps</a> of 1895 shows only a signal box and signals at the location.. By the 1920s only minor infrastructure was present as might be expected at such a remote location with the double track main line, one siding running off to a loading dock to the west, a weighing machine, small buildings and an access off the B744 road to Crosshands with a road over bridge. The signal box or cabin was situated on the eastern side of the main line with several semaphore signal posts and cross over points were present with runaway points located in the up line about 400yds towards <a href="Hurlford">Hurlford</a> from the signal box. In 1898 the signal box was staffed day and night during the week but only from 7.30am to 8pm on Sundays. The G&SWR Permanent Way Department was responsible for the cleaning of the points and signals rather than staff from <a href="Mauchline%20railway%20station">Mauchline railway station</a>.

The siding at Garrochburn was also used as a coal siding for coal traffic to or from the nearby Mauchline Colliery.

The gradient from <a href="Kilmarnock">Kilmarnock</a> eased at Garrochburn Goods depot before a gentle descent into <a href="Mauchline">Mauchline</a> following the passage through Mossgiel or Skeoch Tunnel.

History.
The goods depot at Garrochburn was opened by the <a href="Glasgow%20and%20South-Western%20Railway">Glasgow and South-Western Railway</a> in the 1920s and closed on 4th October 1965. It's construction may have been related to the reconstruction of Mossgiel Tunnel in the mid 1920s. 

The line was opened by the <a href="Glasgow%2C%20Paisley%2C%20Kilmarnock%20and%20Ayr%20Railway">Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway</a>, then joining the <a href="Glasgow%20and%20South-Western%20Railway">Glasgow and South-Western Railway</a> it became part of the <a href="London%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">London Midland and Scottish Railway</a> (LMS) during the <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">Grouping</a> of 1923 and finally part of British Railways in 1948.

Mossgiel Tunnel Platform stood nearby, closed at some point after July 1926 by the <a href="London%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">LMS</a> when the reconstruction of Mossgiel Tunnel had been completed.

Apart from farm traffic and the possible link with the reconstruction of Mossgiel Tunnel the siding at Garrochburn was also used as a coal siding for coal traffic connected with the siding to Mauchline Colliery.

The site today.
The siding has long been removed as have the signal box, track cross-over, weighing machine, etc. leaving plain double track. The railway border of the site is now bordered by trees aand the entrance of the B744 has a private sign that reads 'Garrochburn Sidings' and the area is at present (2017) used for storing mobile caravans, etc.

Lara Trump has appeared in several of the videos to highlight what she described as "real news" in opposition to alleged "<a href="fake%20news">fake news</a>". Lara Trump introduced one video by saying that "If you are tired of all the fake news out there...We are going to bring you nothing but the facts" and that "I bet you haven't heard about all the accomplishments the president had this week, because there's so much fake news out there". Other news sources state that most of what Trump TV reports is untrue and has been labeled as "propaganda".

Reception.
<a href="Dylan%20Byers">Dylan Byers</a>, writing for <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, noted a distinction between Lara Trump's videos and that of previous media communications by politicians noting that "Presidents and lawmakers have used websites and social media platforms for years to promote their achievements, but the 'real news' series goes further, seeking to discredit the mainstream media and advertising what purports to be a reliable alternative". 

<a href="BuzzFeed">BuzzFeed</a> noted that the stories that Lara Trump claimed were unreported, such as the plans of <a href="Foxconn">Foxconn</a> to build a factory in Wisconsin and the donation of President's Trump's salary to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Education">Department for Education</a>, had in fact previously been reported by broadcasters and publications sometimes described as "<a href="mainstream%20media">mainstream media</a>". "Snopes" and CNN contacted the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> for a comment on the videos yet received no reply.

Garet Williams, writing for "<a href="Vox%20%28website%29">Vox</a>", said that Lara Trump's video "might be a partial fulfillment" of plans that Donald Trump might have to launch his own broadcasting network, an idea that has been dubbed 'Trump TV'.

Waunetta McClellan Dominic

Waunetta McClellan Dominic (23 July 1921-21 December 1981) was an <a href="Odawa">Odawa</a> rights activist who spent her career advocating for the United States government to adhere to its treaty obligations to <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a>s. She was one of the founders of the <a href="Northern%20Michigan%20Ottawa%20Association">Northern Michigan Ottawa Association</a> and her influence was widely recognized, especially after winning a 1971 claim against the government for compensation under 19th century treaties. She was also a proponent of Native American fishing rights being protected. In 1979, she was named by "<a href="The%20Detroit%20News">The Detroit News</a>" as "Michiganian of the Year" and in 1996, she was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Michigan%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Michigan Women's Hall of Fame</a>.

Early life.
Waunetta G. McClellan was born on 23 July 1921 in <a href="Petoskey%2C%20Michigan">Petoskey, Michigan</a> to Elizabeth "Lizzie" (née Taylor) and Levi P. McClellan. Her great-grandfather was a leader of the <a href="Grand%20River%20Band%20of%20Ottawas">Grand River Band of Ottawas</a>. She initially attended school in Petoskey and completed her studies at the <a href="Haskell%20Indian%20Nations%20University">Haskell Indian Institute</a> in <a href="Lawrence%2C%20Kansas">Lawrence, Kansas</a>. Marrying Robert Dominic in 1940, the couple made their home in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a>, before returning to Petoskey in 1944.

Career.
The <a href="Indian%20termination%20policy">Indian termination policy</a> established by the federal government in the 1940s created the <a href="Indian%20Claims%20Commission">Indian Claims Commission</a> in 1946, as a means of compensating tribes for previous land takings, undervaluations of compensation, and abridgement of rights. The problem for the Odawa was that the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Detroit%20%281855%29">1855 Treaty of Detroit</a> had been interpreted as severing the tribal governments of each of the bands. To be eligible for filing a claim, they first had to confirm that the bands had "continued to be distinct, self-governing nations". In 1946, the Dominics called for a meeting of local tribes at the local Petoskey grocery store. Only 20 members showed up, making them realize the need to organize. Traveling throughout the state to document descendants of Odawa listed on the Durant Roll (1907-1910), they identified 3,000 American Indians who might be eligible to pursue claims against the U. S. government. 
In 1948, Dominic, her father, and her husband founded the <a href="Northern%20Michigan%20Ottawa%20Association">Northern Michigan Ottawa Association</a> (NMOA), which Robert serving as president of the organization and Waunetta serving as secretary. The organization contained eleven bands of northern <a href="Odawa">Odawa</a> who had been signatories to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Washington%20%281836%29">1836 Treaty of Washington</a> and the subsequently signed 1855 Treaty of Detroit. The following year, they filed a claim under the Claims Commission.

Because most of the tribes their organization represented were not reservation tribes, Dominic was concerned about their lack of access to health care. She fought for the right for NMOA members to be treated at the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a>'s Kinchloe Indian Clinic. Recognizing how few Michigan Indians had received higher education, she discovered federal programs that could be utilized and worked to assist Indian students in obtaining grants and scholarships. Dominic also was a driving force in the Michigan State tuition waiver program for Native American Students. 

In 1959, the government conceded that that the bands of Chippewa and Odawa who had signed the treaties had ceded nearly 13,000,000 acres of land and were entitled to a reassessment of whether they were paid a fair value. Because the <a href="Keweenaw%20Bay%20Indian%20Community">Keweenaw Bay Indian Community</a>, <a href="Lac%20Vieux%20Desert%20Band%20of%20Lake%20Superior%20Chippewa">L’Anse Lac Vieux Desert Band of Chippewa</a>, and the <a href="Ontonagon%20Band">Ontonagon Band of Chippewa</a> had reorganized under the <a href="Indian%20Reorganization%20Act%20of%201934">Indian Reorganization Act of 1934</a>, their members were removed as claimants in the suit, which then went to arbitration over the amount of settlement. Dominic traversed the state examining land records in each county in the state to analyze the variance in payment made to American Indians and the price white settlers sold their lands for historically. She discovered that when the treaties were written in the nineteenth century, Native Americans were paid half of one cent to seventeen cents per acre, when white transactions in the same period were negotiated between ninety-two and ninety-seven cents per acre. 

Finally winning a $12.1 million dollar settlement in 1971, which was reduced to $10.3 million dollars because of funds previously paid, the Dominic's battle continued. Having won the judgement, the problem became how it was to be distributed. The Claims Commission recognized the NMOA and allowed it to pursue the case, but the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> refused to allow the association to reorganize under the <a href="Indian%20Reorganization%20Act">Indian Reorganization Act</a>, claiming that as an association rather than a tribal government, each band would need to seek individual recognition. The initial bill proposed to direct the distribution was rejected by Dominic, as it did not include either non-reservation tribes people (at that point the only reservation tribes were the three which had been eliminated from the suit and the <a href="Sault%20Tribe%20of%20Chippewa%20Indians">Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians</a>, which had been reorganized in 1972) nor the <a href="Blood%20quantum%20laws">blood quantum requirements</a> the tribe members wanted. 

Dominic was the spokesperson for the (NMOA) on fishing rights, often acting as an intermediary between Native and white fisherman. In the 1975 a lawsuit, "United States v. Michigan", was filed concerning those fishing rights and she testified to tribal procedures for issuing licenses and penalties for infractions. The 1979 ruling allowed tribes to continue with gill net fishing, though controversy would continue until 1985 over fishing rights. In 1976, upon her husband's death, Dominic became president of the NMOA and led the organization until her death. Throughout the 1970s, she traveled giving assistance to Odawa with their genealogical records to allow them to participate in the claim distribution and fought to secure that $1.8 million of those funds were set aside for tribes which did not gain federal recognition. She was noted as one of the most influential Native Americans in the state, having led the NMOA to become the largest American Indian organization in the state. In 1979, she was honored by "<a href="The%20Detroit%20News">The Detroit News</a>" as "Michiganian of the Year".

Death and legacy.
Dominic died on 21 December 1981 in Petoskey at Northern Michigan Hospital. She was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Michigan%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Michigan Women's Hall of Fame</a> in 1996. Eventually all the bands of the NOMA would gain recognition, though three of the bands, the <a href="Burt%20Lake%20Band%20of%20Ottawa%20and%20Chippewa%20Indians">Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians</a>, the <a href="Swan%20Creek%20Black%20River%20Confederated%20Ojibwa%20Tribes%20of%20Michigan">Swan Creek Black River Confederated Ojibwa Tribes of Michigan</a> and ironically, her own band, the <a href="Grand%20River%20Band%20of%20Ottawas">Grand River Band of Ottawas</a> are only recognized at the state level. In 1998, the federal government finally agreed to distribute the funds awarded to the Odawa. Having been held in trust since 1971, the final amount of the award was close to $74 million dollars. In 2014, Dominic was again recognized by the Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame, during an exhibit hosted to celebrate six women involved in the struggle for Civil Rights.

Jessie Turnbull

Jessie Turnbull or Jessie McEwen (December, 1845 – 1 June, 1920) was a <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> woman. It was said that if the public were asked to name which "woman who has done most to shape...Canada ...[no] name would stand higher than that of Jessie Turnbull McEwen".

Life.
Turnbull was born probably in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> in 1845. Her first job after leaving college was in women's rights. She was employed under the leadership of <a href="Egerton%20Ryerson">Egerton Ryerson</a> to tour schools to educate parents of the importance of educating girls as well as boys. Turnbull married in 1868 and they lived in Toronto, then Montreal and then back to Toronto.

The <a href="Toronto%20Women%27s%20Literary%20Guild">Toronto Women's Literary Guild</a> was established in 1877 to campaign for women's rights and for improved working conditions. Turnbull and Dr. <a href="Emily%20Howard%20Stowe">Emily Howard Stowe</a>, Canada's second licensed female physician, were founders. The guild had some success in improving access to higher education for women.
It was renamed the <a href="Canadian%20Women%27s%20Suffrage%20Association">Canadian Women's Suffrage Association</a> in 1883 with Jessie (McEwen) Turnbull as its first president. The Toronto-based association worked towards opening up education to women, and allowing women to advance as professionals, particularly as doctors.

In 1884 Turnbull moved to Brandon in Manitoba where her husband had a farm and they built a large house named "Tullichewen" in 1893. In November 1895 she chaired a meeting that heard <a href="Ishbel%20Hamilton-Gordon%2C%20Marchioness%20of%20Aberdeen%20and%20Temair">Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair</a>, who was the <a href="Viceregal%20consort%20of%20Canada">Viceregal consort of Canada</a>, talk about the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Women%20of%20Canada">National Council of Women of Canada</a>.

<doc id="54735882" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54735882" title="Schloss Zweibrücken">
Schloss Zweibrücken

Schloss Zweibrücken is a building in the town of <a href="Zweibr%C3%BCcken">Zweibrücken</a>, Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany. It was built as a ducal palace in 1720-1725. It is the largest and most magificent secular (i.e. non-religious) building in the <a href="Palatinate%20%28region%29">Palatinate</a> (). It is now the seat of the <a href="Palatine%20Higher%20Regional%20Court">Palatine Higher Regional Court</a> (), and of the Zweibrücken law courts ().

History.
The earliest recorded building near the site was a fortress (). It was built in the 12th century by the Counts () of Zweibrücken; the town was on an important trade route. It sat on the eastern side of an open triangular area, which still exists today: the "Schlossplatz" (which translates into English as "Castle Square", whatever its shape might be).

In 1444, a junior (<a href="Cadet%20branch">cadet</a>) branch of the <a href="House%20of%20Wittelsbach">House of Wittelsbach</a> was granted the title of Duke () of a new state: <a href="Palatine%20Zweibr%C3%BCcken">Palatine Zweibrücken</a> (), with its seat in Zweibrücken. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the ducal family modernised and enlarged their dwelling-place. In 1585, they constructed a palace (known as "the long building by the water", ) on the northern side of the "Schlossplatz", complete with water-mill and library.

In 1677, the ancient and the newer buildings were badly damaged during the <a href="Franco-Dutch%20War">Franco-Dutch War</a> (1672–1678). In the early 18th century, <a href="Gustav%2C%20Duke%20of%20Zweibr%C3%BCcken">Gustav, Duke of Zweibrücken</a> ordered the construction of a new residence appropriate for his rank and status. The architect was , whose design was in the modern <a href="Late%20Baroque">Late Baroque</a> style - for show and comfort, and not for defence. In 1720-1725, this palace was built on the northern side of the "Schlossplatz". The site was marshy, so preliminary work involved driving very many oak piles into the ground to provide a solid foundation. That building has been twice destroyed and twice rebuilt; its second reconstruction is the building which exists today.

<a href="Christian%20IV%2C%20Count%20Palatine%20of%20Zweibr%C3%BCcken">Christian IV</a>, Duke of Zweibrücken 1735-1775, entertained notable creative artists at his palace, including the leading operatic composer <a href="Christoph%20Willibald%20von%20Gluck">Christoph Willibald von Gluck</a>. Christian's nephew <a href="Maximilian%20I%20Joseph%20of%20Bavaria">Maximilian</a> (1756-1825) spent some of his childhood at the palace.

On 3 May 1793, during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a>, Zweibrücken was overrun and sacked by French troops. The building was badly damaged.

In 1817, Maximilian, in 1795-1799 merely Duke of Zweibrücken but by now King Maximilian I of Bavaria, gave the ruined building to the Catholic community of the town, with the command to convert it into a church. The central part of the building was walled off from its wings, and was roofed with slate. On 28 May 1820, it was consecrated as the "Maximilianskirche" by <a href="Johann%20Jakob%20Humann">Johann Jakob Humann</a>, <a href="Vicar%20Apostolic">Vicar Apostolic</a> of both <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Speyer">Speyer</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Mainz">Mainz</a>. A bell tower was added later. The east wing was turned into a residence for the clergy. The west wing became a royal residence, and later the seat of the <a href="Palatine%20Higher%20Regional%20Court">Royal Court of Appeals of the Palatinate</a>. In 1867, the "Maximilianskirche" was deconsecrated and the whole building turned over to the administration of justice. The bell tower was taken down.

Société de Commentry, Fourchambault et Decazeville

The Société de Commentry, Fourchambault et Decazeville was an integrated coal, iron and steel company in France.

Background.
In 1817 Jean-Georges Dufaud Père, director of the <a href="Grossouvre">Grossouvre</a> foundry in <a href="Cher">Cher</a>, visited Wales on a commercial visit and noted the iron-making technology in use there.
That year the Trezi foundry at Grossouvre was adapted to manufacturing iron using Welsh techniques, and delivered the first products in 1818.
In 1819 the leases of the Grossouvre site and factories were ceded to Boigues & Fils, iron merchant in Paris, and M. Labbé.
They decided to find a new site on the <a href="Loire">Loire</a> to which it would be easier to transport coal, and decided on <a href="Fourchambault">Fourchambault</a> in <a href="Ni%C3%A8vre">Nièvre</a>.
A dock was built for cargo boats, and the Loire provided water for the steam engines.

Construction of the factory at Fourchambault began in 1821.
The Charbonnières Raveaux and Cramain furnaces became annexes to the new building, and Boigues & Fils collected several furnaces from Nivernais and Berry. 
Manufacturing began in 1822.
Almost 3,000 workers from the surrounding countryside were employed in the cast iron foundry.
In the crisis year of 1848 <a href="Charles%20de%20Wendel">Charles de Wendel</a> and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Schneider">Eugène Schneider</a> saved the foundry at <a href="Fourchambault">Fourchambault</a> from bankruptcy by co-signing a huge bank loan.

19th Century.
The Société de Commentry, Fourchambault et Decazeville was formed in 1853 through a merger of the Fourchambault foundry, <a href="Imphy">Imphy</a> (Nièvre) steelworks, <a href="Montlu%C3%A7on">Montluçon</a> (Allier) foundry and <a href="Commentry">Commentry</a> (Allier) colliery.
The Imphy steelworks was detached from the company and combined with the Saint-Seurin steelworks.
They were adapted to use the <a href="Bessemer%20process">Bessemer process</a>.
In 1869 the two steelworks were reunited with the company.
In 1891 the company acquired the <a href="Brassac-les-Mines">Brassac</a> (Puy-de-Dôme) iron ore mines and in 1892 absorbed the Société des forges et fonderies de l'Aveyron.
The <a href="Aveyron">Aveyron</a> works, founded in 1826 and reorganized in 1868, was one of the first large integrated metallurgical factories in the country.

<a href="Henri%20Fayol">Henri Fayol</a> (1841–1925) was a mining engineer who graduated in 1860.
Henri Fayol was engineer at the <a href="Commentry">Commentry</a> coal mines from 1860 to 1866 and director of these mines from 1866 to 1872.
He was director of the <a href="Commentry">Commentry</a>, <a href="Montvicq">Montvicq</a> and Berry mines from 1872 to 1888.
In 1888 he became director-general of the company, holding office until 1918.
In 1900 Fayol became a member of the central committee of Houillères de France, member of the board of the <a href="Comit%C3%A9%20des%20forges">Comité des forges</a> and administrator of the Société de Commentry Fourchambault et Decazeville.

20th century.
In 1900 the Société de Commentry, Fourchambault et Decazeville included the Commentry, Montvicq, Brassac and <a href="Decazeville">Decazeville</a> (Aveyron) collieries, and the blast furnaces, foundries, forges and steelworks of Fourchambault, Imphy, Montluçon and Decazeville.
The company extracted iron ore from the Berry mines and from its concessions in Aveyron.
Various smaller establishments were absorbed between 1900 and 1950.
In 1900 the company began to exploit the Joudreville concession.
In 1910 the company bought the Mines de Campagnac.

The factories of <a href="Mazi%C3%A8res">Mazières</a> (Cher) and <a href="Pamiers">Pamiers</a> (Ariège) were acquired in 1930.
In 1931 the company bought the Société Métallurgique de l'Ariège and the Société des Mines de Manganèse de Las Cabessas.
In 1942 the company bought the Charbonnages du Centre.
In 1954 the company was renamed the Société métallurgique d'Imphy.
In 1968 it was merged with the Société des forges et aciéries du Creusot, which in 1971 became <a href="Creusot-Loire">Creusot-Loire</a>.
The combined company was in turn absorbed by Creusot-Loire (Saône-et-Loire) in 1971.
The Creusot-Loire group was liquidated in December 1984.

<doc id="54736719" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54736719" title="Cracked nipple">
Cracked nipple

Cracked nipple (or "nipple trauma") is a condition that can occur in breastfeeding women as a result of a number of possible causes. Developing a cracked nipple can result in soreness, dryness or irritation to, or bleeding of, one or both <a href="nipple">nipple</a>s during breastfeeding. The mother with a cracked nipple can have severe nipple pain when the baby is nursing. This severe pain is a disincentive for continued breastfeeding. The crack can appear as a cut across the tip of the nipple and may extend to its the base. Cracked nipples develop after the birth of the infant and is managed with pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment.
Characteristics and diagnosis.
Cracked nipples are classified as a breast disorder. The nipple is not only the structure to delivery milk to the infant, it also contains small, sebaceous glands or <a href="Montgomery%20gland">Montgomery gland</a>s to lubricate the skin of the areola. Cracked nipples are most often associated with breastfeeding and appear as cracks or small lacerations or breaks in the skin of the nipple. In some instances an ulcer will form. The nipple in a nursing mother is in regular contact with a nursing infant. Cracked nipples are trauma to the nipple and can be quite painful. Cracked nipples typically appear three to seven days after the birth.

If the nipples appears to be wedge-shaped, white and flattened, this may indicate that the latch is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples.

Cause.
American studies indicate that cracked nipples are caused by the incorrect latching-on by the infant. Yet other causes could be poor positioning, use of a feeding bottle, <a href="breast%20engorgement">breast engorgement</a>, inexperience, semi-protruding nipples, use of <a href="breast%20pump">breast pump</a>s and light pigmentation of the nipples. These causes vary between <a href="cultures">cultures</a>. Breast engorgement is also a main factor in altering the ability of the infant to latch-on. Engorgement changes the shape and curvature of the nipple region by making the breast inflexible, flat, hard, and swollen. The nipples on an engorged breast are flat.

When the baby is <a href="Latch%20%28breastfeeding%29">latched on</a> correctly, the nipple is located against the <a href="soft%20palate">soft palate</a> in the back of the baby's mouth. When the nipple is near to front of the and being pinched against the <a href="hard%20palate">hard palate</a>, this will cause pain and development of cracked nipples. One cause of painful, cracked nipples is the incorrect positioning and incorrect <a href="latch%20%28breastfeeding%29">latching</a> on to the breast by the infant. The baby can create cracked nipples due to the strong sucking pressure, stretching and pulling the nipple, the <a href="friction">friction</a> and rubbing of skin to skin. The cause of sore, cracked nipples can also be from a yeast or <a href="Candida%20infection">Candida infection</a> in the baby or the mother or both. <a href="Thrush">Thrush</a> can develop after the use of antibiotics. For first-time breastfeeding mothers, it normally takes a few tries before the latch is right, which can make the nipples tender and sore the first few days. If the nipples become cracked or bleed, the latch may need to be corrected. Women are advised to keep on breastfeeding, as it will actually help the nipples heal. A little <a href="breast%20milk">breast milk</a> or purified <a href="lanolin%20cream">lanolin cream</a> or ointment helps the healing process. 

If a <a href="feeding%20bottle">feeding bottle</a> is used in addition to breastfeeding, cracked nipples may result because the different sucking techniques required for the bottle and the breast vary. Bottle-feeding babies uses his or her <a href="tongue">tongue</a> to regulate the flow of milk. This same technique will cause friction on the nipple while breastfeeding. This in turn encourages the continued use of the bottle with less time breastfeeding.

In rare circumstances, <a href="Raynaud%20syndrome">Reynaud phenomenon</a> has been a cause of cracked nipples in breast-feeding women. The pain in this circumstance also leads to the cessation of breast-feeding. In addition to cracks, or <a href="blister">blister</a>s <a href="ulcers">ulcers</a> can form.

Infection.
<a href="Bacteria">Bacteria</a> can enter the breast through cracked nipples. This can result in an infection of the breast - <a href="mastitis">mastitis</a>. Breastmilk has <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> action and can protect the baby from infections. The antibacterial properties of milk help to protect the infant. A breast feeding mother can become infected by a Candida infection (thrush) infection in the infant and develop deep-pink, cracked, and sore nipples. It has been found safe for breastfeeding mothers with hepatitis B and cracked nipples to breastfeed. In the event that a nursing woman experiences cracked and bleeding nipples or breast inflammation within one to two weeks immediately following an acute Toxoplasmosis infection (when the organism is still circulating in her bloodstream), it is theoretically possible that she could transmit "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>" to the infant through her breast milk. Immune suppressed women could have circulating Toxoplasma for even longer periods of time. However, the likelihood of human milk transmission is very small. Transmission risk of HIV increases if the mother has cracked and bleeding nipples An uncommon infection in the mother, Chagas disease, can be transmitted to the nursing infant via cracked nipples. Women with hepatitis C are advised to abstain from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding.

Treatment.
Cracked nipples can be treated with 100% lanolin. Glycerin nipple pads can be chilled and placed over the nipples to help soothe and heal cracked or painful nipples. If the cause of cracked nipples is from thrush, treatment is usually begun with nystatin. If the mother is symptomatic then the mother and the baby can be treated. Continuing to breastfeed will actually help the nipples heal. A little breast milk or purified lanolin cream or ointment helps the healing process. Breastfeeding professionals that include nurses, midwives and lactation consultants are able to assist in the treatment of cracked nipples.

Advice from others is abundant but there have been some treatments that have been identified as not being effective in healing or preventing cracked nipples. These ineffective treatments are keeping the breastfeeding short and using a nipple guard. Keeping the feedings short so that the nipples can rest is not effective in relieving the pain of cracked nipples and it could have a negative effect on the milk supply. Nipple shields do not improve latching on.

Prevention.
The nipples of nursing mothers naturally make a lubricant to prevent drying, cracking, or infections. Cracked nipples may be able to be prevented by:


<a href="Roman%20chamomile">Roman chamomile</a> can be applied directly to the skin for pain and swelling and is used to treat cracked nipples.

Epidemiology.
In a survey in New York city 35% of nursing mothers stopped breastfeeding after one week due to the pain of cracked nipples. Thirty percent stopped breastfeeding between weeks one and three. Another survey of breastfeeding mothers in Brazil reported that there was 25% higher risk of interruption of exclusive breastfeeding when the women had cracked nipples. Mothers with higher education levels are more likely to continue breastfeeding despite the pain of cracked nipples.

In culture.
The importance of preventing cracked nipples while breastfeeding has been reported. In an informal survey of breastfeeding in the UK, some mothers reported that they stopped breastfeeding because the cracked nipples made it too painful.

Zieria ingramii

Zieria ingramii, commonly known as Keith's zieria, is a plant in the citrus <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Rutaceae">Rutaceae</a> and is <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to a small area in central <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. It is a slender, spindly, aromatic shrub with three-part, <a href="clover">clover</a>-like leaves and clusters of about seven white to pale pink flowers with four <a href="petal">petal</a>s and four <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s. The species is only known from two state forests near <a href="Dubbo">Dubbo</a>.

Description.
"Zieria ingramii" is a slender, spindly, aromatic shrub which grows to a height of . Its branches are ridged but unlike some other zierias, not warty. The leaves are composed of three linear to narrow elliptic leaflets with the central one long, wide and with a <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petiole</a> long. Both surfaces of the leaflets are the same colour and the edges of the leaflets are rolled under, almost to the mid-vein. The upper surface is more or less <a href="wikt%3Aglabrous">glabrous</a> and covered with oil <a href="Gland%20%28botany%29">glands</a> while the lower surface is covered with long, soft hairs. The flowers are arranged in clusters of about seven, ranging from three to thirteen in leaf <a href="wikt%3Aaxil">axil</a>s, the clusters about the same length as the leaves. The <a href="sepal">sepal</a>s are triangular, about long and glabrous. The four <a href="petal">petal</a>s are white to pale pink, about long with their bases overlapping each other and are hairy on the outer surface and glabrous on the inner one. There are four stamens. Flowering occurs in spring and is followed by fruit which are glabrous, warty, four-chambered <a href="Capsule%20%28botany%29">capsules</a> containing dull black seeds.

This zieria is similar to "<a href="Zieria%20aspalathoides">Z. aspalathoides</a>" but that species has fewer but larger flowers in each group and shorter, warty leaflets.

Taxonomy and naming.
"Zieria ingramii" was first formally described in 2002 by <a href="James%20Andrew%20Armstrong">James Armstrong</a> from a specimen collected in the <a href="Goonoo%20Important%20Bird%20Area">Goonoo State Forest</a> and the description was published in "<a href="Australian%20Systematic%20Botany">Australian Systematic Botany</a>". Both the <a href="Botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> ("ingramii") and the common name honour the botanical collector Keith Ingram.

Distribution and habitat.
Keith's zieria is currently only known from Goonoo Forest and Cobbora Forest near Dubbo where it grows in woodland and forest in light, sandy soil. It often occurs with black cypress pine ("<a href="Callitris%20endlicheri">Callitris endlicheri</a>") and blue-leaved ironbark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20nubila">Eucalyptus nubila</a>").

Conservation.
"Zieria ingramii" is classified as "endangered" under the Australian Government "<a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>" and the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. Only about 2,000 individual plants are known and the reasons for the species' decline are not well understood although absence of fire may be a contributing factor.

96Boards

Overview.
96Boards is a range of open platform specifications created by <a href="Linaro">Linaro</a> to make the latest <a href="ARM%20architecture">ARM</a>-based <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">processors</a> available to developers at a reasonable cost. The specifications are open and define a standard board layout for <a href="System%20on%20a%20chip">SoC</a>-agnostic (processor independent) development platforms that can be used by software application, hardware device, kernel and other system software developers. Boards produced to the 96Boards specifications are suitable for rapid prototyping, hobbyist projects or incorporation into new systems for a wide range of applications including desktop and laptop computing, the digital home, digital signage, point of sale (POS), high-end audio, robotics and drones, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, IoT and industrial control.

Standardized expansion buses for peripheral I/O have led to a wide range of compatible add-on mezzanine boards that will work across a variety of 96Boards products. Users have access to a wide range of boards with different features at various price points. In addition, some SoC vendors have announced long term availability of the SoC to encourage their use in products with long life cycles.

At launch in 2015, there was one board available and several under development. This first board, the HiKey made by CircuitCo, had “spotty availability” and was soon replaced by a LeMaker version that has become a reference platform for Android Open Source Project (AOSP) development. In early 2016, the 96Boards community began to grow as more boards were added to the lineup, though still faced much pressure from the much desired <a href="Raspberry%20Pi">Raspberry Pi 3</a>. Currently, the 96Boards website has listed three specifications, five Consumer Edition (CE) boards, one Enterprise Edition (EE) board, two <a href="Internet%20of%20things">IoT</a> Edition board and ranges of mezzanine products and accessories.

History.
On February 9, 2015 Linaro announced the 96Boards initiative to accelerate ARM software development by offering a hardware specification that multiple vendors could make boards for. A fixed set of minimum interfaces are required by the specifications, for example the Consumer Edition (CE) specification requires standard USB, micro-SD, HDMI, power, and low- and high-speed peripheral connectors. Vendors may add customized hardware and feature sets provided the form factor and minimum set of interfaces are supported. Since the original consumer edition release there have been specifications for Enterprise, Set-top box and IoT devices.

Despite Linaro's ARM focus the 96Boards specification is fairly relaxed about the processors that need to be supported which allows vendors to experiment with boards such as the Curious Curie which is based on the <a href="Intel%20Quark">Intel Quark</a> processor with an embedded binarized neural network (eBNN).

On April 27, 2017 a board adhering to the 96Board Consumer Edition Open Standard becomes a development platform for the <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29%23Open-source%20community">Android Open Source Project (AOSP)</a>

Specifications and implementations.
There are currently three published 96Boards specifications for low-cost ARMv7-A and ARMv8-A development boards:

Consumer Edition.
The 96Boards Consumer Edition (CE) specification targets the mobile, embedded and digital home segments. The boards below are all certified conforming to this specification, which defines a fixed set and location for minimum functions including USB, SD and HDMI connectors.
40 Pin Low Speed Expansion Connector.
96Boards Consumer Edition
Low Cost Hardware Platform Specification
Version 1.0, January 2015 

Enterprise Edition.
The 96Boards Enterprise Edition (EE) specification targets the networking and server segments. 
IoT Edition.
The 96Boards IoT specification targets the development in the Internet of Things (IoT) space.
96Boards Mezzanines.
96Boards mezzanine products enables expansions for Consumer Edition or Enterprise Edition 96Boards in the form of new interfaces and hardware IoT, industrial control, and other embedded applications.

The following mezzanine expansion boards are currently available.

Gertrude Quinlan

Gertrude Quinlan (February 23, 1880 – ) was an American actress of <a href="soubrette">soubrette</a> roles, singing in over 125 operas.

Quinlan spent most of her youth in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>. Before she finished school, she made her first appearance with the Castle Square Opera Company, then located in Boston. She sang in the chorus for about two years and she was entrusted with small speaking parts, gradually working her way up to be principal soubrette. In this capacity, she sang with the Castle Square forces in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a>, <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a>. She varied her operatic experience a bit by playing part of a season in a melodrama entitled "The Red, White and Blue." The season of 1901–02, Quinlan originated Annette in "King Dodo," and the two seasons following this, she was Chiquita in "The Sultan of Sum." It was the fall of 1904, she created Flora Wiggins in "The College Widow," and she played the part three years. Quinlan established herself as a comedienne, in opera and comedy.
Early years and education.
Gertrude Quinlan was born in <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, February 23, 1880. She was a daughter of Michael Charles and Ellen (Barret) Quinlan and the fifth in a family of seven girls. Her father was a schoolmaster in Ireland. Since he came to the United States and settled in Boston, he lived in retirement.

Quinlan was graduated at the Franklin Grammar School in Boston in 1892, and during the school year of 1893 she attended the Girls' High School in that city. From the age of four years, she sang in various church and charity concerts, and, knowing that she possessed a natural and exceptional <a href="soprano">soprano</a> voice, she determined in her early years to cultivate that gift and make it her means of livelihood, whether it did or did not win her a reputation in the operatic world. Her voice had constant training since the day she entered the chorus. She studied under Franklyn Smith, of Boston, Frederic Bruegger, of Chicago, and Karl Brenneman, of New York.

Career.
Her career advanced despite her parents' objections and a lack of money for training. She obtained her parents consent at 23, she entered the chorus of the Castle Square Opera Company, singing at the <a href="Castle%20Square%20Theatre">Castle Square Theatre</a>, Boston, in May, 1895. She remained there one year, learning the score of a new opera each week, and rehearsing one for the following week, while singing in two performances daily. She was often taken from the chorus and given one or two lines, an honor for a girl not 16 and with only a few months' experience.

In May, 1896, she accompanied the Castle Square Opera Company to Philadelphia, and sang with them at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera%20House%20%28Philadelphia%29">Grand Opera House</a> for a year and a half. While there, she became understudy to Clara Lane, and was often called upon to sing her roles without rehearsal to give herself confidence.

Quinlan's first appearance in New York was at the American Theatre, January 17, 1898, in "The Lily of Killarney," taking the part of Anne Shute. During the following summer, she played one of the two principals in "Red, White, and Blue," a war drama, with Raymond Hitchcock, creating the character of Hetty Hall, an American girl, the company making a tour of the small cities around New York. This was followed by "Shenandoah" at the Academy of Music, where she characterized Junie Buckthome, the General's daughter, until in the summer of 1901 when she rejoined the Castle Square Opera Company at the <a href="Fine%20Arts%20Building%20%28Chicago%29%23Studebaker%20Theatre">Studebaker Theatre</a> in Chicago. She sang in Chicago two seasons.

Quinlan sang in over 125 operas, and played all the principal soubrette parts in the same. She made her first distinct success as Broni Slava in the "Beggar Student," and became an especial favorite as Pitti Sing in the "<a href="The%20Mikado">The Mikado</a>" while in Chicago. She was also a piquant comedienne, and made progress toward fame since her appearance in the comic opera, "Tarantella," as Junie, in 1901. The next year, she was given the part of Annette in the cast of "King Dodo," and during the season of 1902–1903, she was Chiquita at the <a href="Tremont%20Theatre%2C%20Boston%20%281889%29">Tremont Theatre</a> in Boston and <a href="Wallack%27s%20Theatre">Wallack's Theatre</a>, New York.

She was always under the management of the Castle Square Opera Company, and rendered them several important services, which naturally advanced her in their estimation and in her profession. Quinlan was not a member of any societies or clubs, but a most devoted parishioner of the Roman Catholic church.

<doc id="54737149" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54737149" title="Hara Gebeya–Mek'ele Railway">
Hara Gebeya–Mek'ele Railway

The Hara Gebeya–Mek'ele Railway is a <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a> <a href="railway">railway</a> under construction, that will serve as a northward extension of the new <a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20Ethiopia">Ethiopian National Railway Network</a>.

The railroad's primary purpose is to connect the <a href="Tigray%20Region">Tigray Region</a> with the <a href="Awash%E2%80%93Hara%20Gebeya%20Railway">Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway</a>. It runs through almost the only corridor, that allows the connection of the very isolated Tigray region with the rest of Ethiopia. As (in 2010) the <a href="GDP">GDP</a> of Tigray region made up only 3-4% of that of Ethiopia (with a frozen war with <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a> along its northern and inaccessible boarder), the economic value of this railway is rather questionable. There was speculation on Social Media, that the railway was to be used primarily for military purposes in another hot war with Eritrea.

Route and description.
The 216 km long single-track railway starts at Hara Gebeya at the junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway. Only two railway stations are major ones, both termini, one at Hara Gebeya and one at Mek'ele. For the first 40 km after Hara Gebeya, the railway runs through rugged terrain at the eastern escarpment of the <a href="Ethiopian%20Highland">Ethiopian Highland</a>. After 40 km, behind <a href="Kobo%2C%20Ethiopia">Kobo</a>, the railway enters, for the next 120 km, a <a href="sedimentary%20basin">sedimentary basin</a> with almost no hills and no prominent landscape features. The <a href="Alamata">Alamata</a> and <a href="Mehoni">Mehoni</a> railway stations are here, serving a few underway towns. 

After 160 km, a rugged and arid landscape appears, that leads to the <a href="Megale">Megale</a> station. Megale is a woreda at the boarder between Tigray Region and <a href="Afar%20region">Afar region</a>, that is almost empty, no persons are living here. Nevertheless, this railway stations is possibly the most interesting along the route, as Megale station provides access to the <a href="Danakil%20depression">Danakil depression</a>, one of the hottst places in the world with several well-known volcanoes like <a href="Erta%20Ale">Erta Ale</a>. Megale station also offers access to <a href="Abala%2C%20Ethiopia">Abala</a> (or Shiket), one of the Afar capital towns. Behind Megale, the railway makes a turn to the northwest and a jump of 600 meters, from 1600 m to 2200 m elevation in just 30 km. The railway has an almost constant slope of 2.5 % here - over 30 km - with lots of tunnels and bridges. Behind the railway station of <a href="Adi%20Gudem">Adi Gudem</a>, the railway reaches its terminus at <a href="Mek%27ele%20Airport">Mek'ele Airport</a>, east of <a href="Mek%27ele">Mek'ele</a>, on the Ethiopian highland.

Railway characteristics.
The railway was based in many aspects on the railway characteristics pre-defined by the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway to keep the railways interoperable. However, a few things (like the maximum slope) were adapted to the special conditions in the montainous area. 


The single-track section is equipped with passing loops with three lines.

History.
After the new <a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20Ethiopia">National Railway Network of Ethiopia</a> was considered to be constructed from 2010 on, the railway was awarded to constructors in 2012. The construction did start in February 2015. 

The 216 km Hara Gebeya–Mek'ele Railway (with a total of 241 km of rails) did not receive any known loan from foreign institutions (there have been several and always contradictory reports but a look at the balance sheet provides the numbers). Given the total construction budget of US $1.5b, expected costs were US $6.2m per km of rails, which was substantially higher than that for the other railways. The <a href="China%20Communications%20Construction">China Communications Construction Company</a> became the prime contractor for the railway. 

The debt eventually became too high to simply continue construction works on this particular railway. This led to a stop of works early in 2017. In March 2017, the construction stop became apparent, workers were laid off and most of the construction sites were silent in May 2017. The construction progress was at 46% completion at that time. A few weeks later, another wave of construction works at railway sites began with a focus on tunnels and bridges, but the future of the railway is uncertain.

<doc id="54737227" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54737227" title="Whiteside County Courthouse">
Whiteside County Courthouse

The Whiteside County Courthouse is a government building in <a href="Morrison%2C%20Illinois">Morrison</a>, the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of <a href="Whiteside%20County%2C%20Illinois">Whiteside County</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Completed in 1987 to replace a 19th-century predecessor, it is the fourth <a href="courthouse">courthouse</a>, in the third community, to serve Whiteside County officials since the county's formation.

History.
Growing settlement in northwestern Illinois prompted the legislature to establish <a href="Peoria%20County%2C%20Illinois">Peoria County</a> in 1825 and to separate its northwestern portions as <a href="Jo%20Daviess%20County%2C%20Illinois">Jo Daviess County</a> two years later. Out of this county's southern portions was formed Whiteside County in 1836, although it temporarily remained attached to the parent county, and full organization required a number of years to complete; not until 1852 could the county be divided into <a href="civil%20township">townships</a>, for example. By this time, the area was well settled, the first pioneers having arrived more than twenty years prior, and as early as 1858, there was an old-settlers' association in operation.

County voters met to choose a <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> in 1839, selecting <a href="Lyndon%2C%20Illinois">Lyndon</a>, but <a href="Sterling%2C%20Illinois">Sterling</a> residents were dissatisfied with this choice; the county commissioners allowed a second vote at which the upstart supplanted Lyndon, and the seat was moved in 1841. Nevertheless, the contest continued: county residents pressured legislators in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield</a>, who over the next four years enacted three separate laws seeking to resolve the question: a commission was appointed to ascertain the best location in 1843, a Lyndon lawsuit seeking to retrieve the seat status was quashed by an 1846 law naming Sterling the seat, and an 1849 act ordered another election whose decision was to be final. Sterling being the victor of this election, Lyndon finally ceased to contend, but in 1857, the residents of Morrison urged the passage of another law to permit yet another election, and their victory in this vote caused the seat to move in 1858.

Previous courthouses.
Whiteside County's first courthouse was a simple building constructed on the Lyndon public square, starting in 1840, but as the county seat was removed to Sterling one year later, it saw only a short period of use for its original purpose. Sterling then built a two-<a href="storey">story</a> square brick courthouse with a second-floor courtroom, within which several local churches worshipped before completing their buildings. It stood until the late 1870s, unoccupied after the county offices moved to Morrison, but after its demolition the site was redeveloped into a residential neighborhood. The third courthouse was completed in 1865 at a cost of over $14,000, it was a significantly larger building, , with an unusual circular courtroom, it was a two-story brick structure with county offices on the first floor and courtrooms on the second. The style was <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a>, due partly to features such as a domed <a href="cupola">cupola</a> and doubled <a href="bracket%20%28architecture%29">brackets</a> under the <a href="eaves">eaves</a> of the shallow roof.

Current courthouse.
Designed by Phillips Swager Associates, a <a href="Peoria%2C%20Illinois">Peoria</a> architectural firm, the current courthouse was constructed between 1982 and 1987. A firmly <a href="Modernist%20architecture">modernist</a> building, the courthouse features a wall of brick with a continuous <a href="course%20%28architecture%29">course</a> of windows at the center of each story. A large <a href="bay%20window">bay window</a>, the height of the entire floor, projects from the top story atop a column-supported <a href="overhang%20%28architecture%29">overhang</a> that covers an outdoors walking area on one side of the building.

Clinton Liberal Institute

The Clinton Liberal Institute was a <a href="coeducational">coeducational</a> <a href="University-preparatory%20school">preparatory school</a> established by the <a href="Universalist%20Church">Universalist Church</a> in the village of <a href="Clinton%2C%20Oneida%20County%2C%20New%20York">Clinton</a>, in the <a href="Kirkland%2C%20New%20York">Town of Kirkland, New York</a>, in 1831, relocated to <a href="Fort%20Plain%2C%20New%20York">Fort Plain, New York</a> in 1878, and remaining there until its buildings were destroyed in a fire in 1900.

History.
Efforts by the Universalist Church to establish a non-denominational school in the State of New York began in 1831. The intent of these efforts was to create a school "not only for general purposes of science and literature, but with a particular view of furnishing with an education young men designed for the ministry of reconciliation", due to the perception that other Christian schools that dominated the state were "hostile to the doctrine" of Universalism. To this end, the Clinton Liberal Institute was established in Clinton, New York, and the first students were admitted in November 1831. On April 29, 1834, the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> passed a bill entitled "A A to incorporate the Clinton liberal institute", formally allowing a group of eighteen trustees to create "The Clinton Liberal Institute" as a body "for the purpose of providing a literary seminary for the public instruction and education of youth."

The original building of the Institute was four stories tall (plus a basement), with a base 96 by 52 feet, built of gray stone. A separate wooden building for classes for women was two stories tall, and 40 by 25 feet. The school was placed under the visitation of the Regents of nearby <a href="Hamilton%20College%20%28New%20York%29">Hamilton College</a> in 1836.

In 1845, after much discussion within the Universalist Church about establishing a <a href="seminary">seminary</a> in the state of New York, Reverend Thomas J. Sawyer—a leading proponent of such an establishment—took charge of the Clinton Liberal Institute. He set aside two hours per day to lecture on <a href="theology">theology</a> to any students who wanted to attend, at no cost to the students. He continued to offer this additional instruction until the fall of 1853, by which time efforts were underway to open a Universalist seminary elsewhere in New York. Sawyer prepared a total of 37 students to enter the ministry during this period.

In 1878, the Institute was relocated from Clinton to the facilities of the former Fort Plain Female Seminary and Collegiate Institute in <a href="Fort%20Plain%2C%20New%20York">Fort Plain, New York</a>. In 1891, the Institute established a <a href="military%20academy">military academy</a> (with both male and female cadets) as part of the school, and had an armory for the storage of <a href="artillery">artillery</a> equipment. All of the Institute's buildings at the Fort Plain location were destroyed in a fire on March 25, 1900. The Institute's "remaining resources were then transferred to <a href="Canton%2C%20New%20York">Canton, New York</a>, and merged with the theological school of <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20University">St. Lawrence University</a>."

Presidency of Francois Hollande

The presidency of Francois Hollande began on 15 May 2012 when the <a href="Constitutional%20Council%20%28France%29">Constitutional Council</a> announced the official results from the <a href="French%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">presidental election</a> during his <a href="French%20presidential%20inauguration">inauguration</a> and ended on 14 May 2017 when <a href="Emmanuel%20Macron">Emmanuel Macron</a> was officially inaugurated as the 25th President of France. Hollande served alongside Prime Minister <a href="Jean-Marc%20Ayrault">Jean-Marc Ayrault</a> until 2014 then <a href="Manuel%20Valls">Manuel Valls</a> until 2016 and finally <a href="Bernard%20Cazeneuve">Bernard Cazeneuve</a>.

Hollande's presidency was dominated by the rising unemployment rate, the protests against reforms of the Labor code including the <a href="El%20Khomri%20law">El Khomri law</a> and the fight against Islamic Terrorism, mainly against the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIS</a>.

Francois Hollande declared in December 2016 that he was not going to run for a second term following low approval ratings. He was succeeded by former Minister of Economy, Emmanuel Macron.

Domestic policy.
Economy.
The key economic focuses for Francois Hollande were the rising unemployment rate, income inequality and the deficit.

Francois Hollande said he underestimated the economic crisis when he first came into office, the first Budget of the Hollande presidency included several tax measures that were badly received mainly due to the increase in the taxation of capital gains. The increase meant that an entrepreneur who sold their company after 10 years would have to pay a 45 percent income tax rate, plus 15.5 percent in social contributions, so amounting to over 60 percent in tax. A movement labelled "les pigeons" was launched by entrepreneurs opposing the new tax measure. Hollande also abolished the increase on VAT that Sarkozy introduced though he later said that he regretted his decision.

A tax increase was introduced by Jean-Marc Ayrault to make up for the public deficit, the tax was estimated to create a revenue of 30 million euro a year, this was later reversed in favor of the creation of tax credits to make the economy for competitive. Eventually <a href="Supply-side%20economics">supply side economics</a> was adopted by the government and taxation was lowered after poor performance and tax migration by individuals with higher incomes, including <a href="Bernard%20Arnault">Bernard Arnault</a>.

Employment was one of the key focuses for Hollande, he set an objective reversing the rising unemployment by the end of his first term. By the end of Hollande's term, unemployment had increased by 25%. By Q3 2015, unemployment was at the highest level in France since 1997. The Ayrault government put forward several plans to try to curb the youth employment including Law 2012-1189 which aimed to help young people with a lack of employment due to no training. This created the ""emplois d'avenir"" which gave young people between the ages of 16 and 25 contract ranging from one to three years in the public sector. 

In March 2013, proposal no. 33 otherwise known as ""contrat de génération"" was introduced with the intention to find young people long term contracts and make it easier for them to integrate into the labor market while securing the jobs of anyone above the age of 55. The proposal offered a €4000 subsidy to firms under 300 employees that employed anyone under the age of 26 without firing anyone over 57 while businesses with over 300 employees would need to produce a plan with the help of a trade union. The plan led to <a href="Disneyland%20Paris">Disneyland Paris</a> planning to hire over 600 under 26's by 30 September 2016 and <a href="Renault">Renault</a> taking on 2000 young people a year under student contracts and 800 young people permanently. The proposal will cost €920,000 by 2016.

The El Khomri Law, which seeked to make it easier for companies to lay off workers, reduce overtime payments for hours worked above the 35-hour work week and reduce severance payments that workers were entitled to if their company had made them redundant was passed in August 2016. The law was intended to make France's economy more competitive.

During the 2012 presidential election, Hollande said he wanted to reduce the government deficit to 3% of GDP by 2013. He attempted to do this by raising taxes and cutting public spending. In 2013, Hollande postponed the objective to 2014 following rising unemployment and slow growth. In 2014, Hollande announced a plan to reduce spending by 50 billion euros between 2015 and 2017. The draft budget for 2016, announced in October 2015 shown a continued freeze on the wage of civil servants, a decreased in grants to local and regional governments, a reduction in the public sector wage and a reduction in taxes for most tax brackets. The deficit reached 3.5% of GDP in 2015. The 2017 budget announced a target for the deficit to reach 2.7% of GDP. The government's fiscal oversight committee, <a href="Haut%20Conseil%20des%20finances%20publiques%20%28France%29">The Council of Public Finances</a> said this was "unlikely."

Even though Hollande criticised Sarkozy when <a href="Standard%20%26amp%3B%20Poor%27s">Standard & Poor</a> downgraded France's financial rating, agencies have repeatedly downgraded France's rating during Hollande's presidency. In 2012, <a href="Moody%27s%20Analytics">Moody's</a> downgraded France from Aa1 to Aaa with a negative outlook economically. S&P downgraded France in November 2013 from AA+ to AA. <a href="Fitch%20Ratings">Fitch</a> downgraded France to AA with a stable outlook in 2014 In 2015, Moody's downgraded France for a second time to Aa2.

Housing policy.
In 2013, Hollande introduced proposal no. 22 better known as the Duflot Law. This proposal aimed to regulate the prices of rent and cap real estate fees. This was intended to stop properties in cities like <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> from being highly priced. Rents following the Duflot Law were determined by decree and must be inferior by 20% to the market price. The Duflot Law was praised by the left in France but criticised by economists and property developers. <a href="C%C3%A9cile%20Duflot">Cécile Duflot</a> later was replaced by Sylvia Pinel and a law superseding the Duflot Law was introduced named the Pinel Act in 2014. The Pinel Act is intended to encourage investment in new housing construction by offering investors a tax reduction of up to €63,000 on their personal income tax. The reduction in taxes on income is spread over 6 years, 9 years or 12 years and the construction must meet the energy and thermal regulations and economic standards.

In 2014, the number of house sales in France dropped to its lowest levels in 17 years.

In 2015, larger fines were introduced to landlords with housing that doesn't meet the regulations set by the government.

Education.
Hollande promised during the 2012 presidential campaign to create 60,000 teaching jobs. Between 2012 and 2016, more than 40,000 teaching jobs have been created. In 2013, the <a href="Law%20on%20Higher%20Education%20and%20Research%20%28France%29">Law on Higher Education and Research</a> was introduced in an attempt to add more national limits to universities and to attempt to combat the lack of cooperation between the state and the universities. Hollande's government also attempted to reform the school time taken by students in an attempt to reduce the school load.

Healthcare.
Hollande attempted to modernize France's healthcare system in January 2016 with the Minister of Social Affairs and Health Marisol Touraine proposing a new law to accomplish this. During Hollande's presidency, cigarette packages were also neutralized.

Justice.
<a href="Christiane%20Taubira">Christiane Taubira</a> served as Minister of Justice from 2012 to 2016 and pushed through several reforms such as legalising same-sex marriage and putting France into a state of emergency.

In 2012, Priority Security Zones were created in France under Interior Minister Manuel Valls, these planned to restrict crime and add more security into communes where crime was more rampant. A study conducted found that drug trafficking, one of the main reasons these zones were created, were not affected by the establishment of the safe zones. There are 751 no-go zones in France.

After the <a href="November%202015%20Paris%20attacks">November 2015 Paris Attacks</a>, 5,000 police jobs, 2,500 jobs within the state justice system and 1,000 immigration customs jobs were slated to be created within two years. Better equipment was also provided to police following the attacks.

Defense.
During Francois Hollande's presidency, the French Armed Forces were planned to lose 34,000 jobs by 2019, until the November 2015 Paris Attacks where he increased the defence budget by 3.5 billion euros and 18,500 jobs were ultimately kept.

France exported more than 10 billion euros worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia in 2015. and has been labeled as the fourth biggest exporter of weapons globally.

Following the 2016 Nice Attacks, Hollande reestablished the French National Guard for the first time since 1872. The National Guard will serve as an operational reserve for both the army and the police.

Social policy.
LGBT rights.
At the beginning of Hollande's term, same-sex marriage was legalised after the longest parliamentary debate in the history of the Fifth Republic. The law was opposed by right wing protestors and lobbying was done to prevent the law to the <a href="Constitutional%20Council%20%28France%29">Constitutional Council</a>, though the challenge was rejected.

Women's rights.
In 2012, at the start of his term, Hollande promised to lead a global fight to end violence against women. His government have been trying experiments to encourage gender equality, including teaching children in classrooms the "ABCD's of equality."

Pension reform.
An announced plan in 2013 consists of a package of measures to revise the pension system. It aims to help with the estimated deficit of 20 billion euros by 2020. This is following a similar plan by <a href="Fillon%20government">Francois Fillion's government</a> in 2010. Funds allocated to retirement homes were reduced by 200 million euros in 2017.

Immigration.
Hollande's policies regarding immigration have been radically different to his predecessor Nicholas Sarkozy who threatened numerous times to remove France from the Schengen area. Hollande attempted to give foreigners the right to vote in local elections in 2012 but abandoned the plan in 2015. Hollande has said that France has a "problem with Islam" and that he thinks that is too much immigration.

Hollande proposed removing dual citizenship from terrorists though abandoned the plan after backlash within The Socialist Party.

International policy.
Hollande has been branded a neo-conservative due to his willingness to engage in Mali and in Syria though Hollande has intervened in foreign affairs less than <a href="Jacques%20Chirac">Jacques Chirac</a> or <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a>. Hollande's diplomatic management has been compared to Nicholas Sarkozy's despite the differences in personality. 

Withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Hollande pledged during the 2012 presidental campaign that he would start the withdrawal of French troops in Afghanistan. He began an early withdrawal in 2012 following a visit to Kabul where he addressed French soldiers and told them their "mission was finished. This was despite criticisms from several heads of state, including Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>.

Intervention in Mali.
Military intervention in Mali was the first major intervention during Francois Hollande's presidency, the intervention began with <a href="Operation%20Serval">Operation Serval</a> on January 11, 2013. The intervention was launched in an attempt to stop the advance of Islamist insurgent groups who had taken most of the North of Mali and had begin to move towards the capital, <a href="Bamako">Bamako</a>. Operation Serval was completed on July 11, 2014. France began to withdraw its 3,000 troops in 2013 as an UN peacekeeping force was stationed in Mali.

Operation Barkhane was started on 1 August, 2014 in an attempt to stop Islamic terrorism in the region after clearing insurgents from Mali.

Operation Sangaris.
Hollande launched <a href="Operation%20Sangaris">Operation Sangaris</a> in December 2013 after international aid was requested by President <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Boziz%C3%A9">Francois Boziz</a> following advance by <a href="S%C3%A9l%C3%A9ka">Séléka</a>, a rebel group that had been able to capture parts of the capital. In October 2013, the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>'s state lost the ability to maintain order and the United Nations began to voice concerns of potential genocide.

In 2016, Operation Sangaris was ended and deemed a success with the government claiming that it had stopped the fighting in C.A.R.

Syria.
Francois Hollande has been one of the biggest opponents against <a href="Bashar%20al-Assad">Bashar al-Assad</a>. Hollande had been one of the biggest advocates for military intervention in Syria and in 2013 declared France ready to conduct air strikes against the Assad regime following the uses of chemical warfare during the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian Civil War</a> though <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s final decision to not launch strikes against Syria left France diplomatically isolated and ultimately, the strikes weren't launched.

Francois Hollande has said that France supplied weapons to the Kurdistanis and to the Syrian Rebels.

In April 2017, Hollande spoke in favor of <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>'s <a href="2017%20Shayrat%20missile%20strike">strikes against the Assad Regime</a> after suspicions that the regime <a href="Khan%20Shaykhun%20chemical%20attack">used chemical warfare against civilians</a>.

Association for the Advancement of Women

Association for the Advancement of Women (A.A.W.) was an American women's organization founded in 1873. 

The organization was the outcome of a call issued by Sorosis in May, 1868, for a Congress of Women to be held in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> that autumn, and the object of the Association, as adopted by the first Congress, was "to receive and present practical methods for securing to women higher intellectual, moral and physical conditions, and thereby to improve all domestic and social relations." The history of this Association, with its annual congresses for the succeeding 30 years, is the history of the realization of its lofty aim, to arouse thought along many lines, science, art, education, philosophy, ethics, political and social science, industrial training. Many eminent women were connected with it, but it is interesting to notice in the reports of the congresses the reiteration of the phrase,— "<a href="Julia%20Ward%20Howe">Mrs. Howe</a> in the chair." For many years she was president.

The Association was organized at the very beginning of the club movement, to interest the women of the country in matters of high thought and in all undertakings found to be useful to society, and to promote their efficiency in these through sympathetic acquaintance and co-operation. It had a number of distinguished presidents and held congresses in many States, which almost invariably led to the formation of local clubs for study and mutual improvement, as well as to good works in other lines. Among the cities in which a congress was held were New York, Syracuse, Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Des Moines, Denver, Madison, St. Paul, Toronto, Baltimore, Memphis, Knoxville, Louisville, Atlanta and New Orleans. Many distinguished women were included in its membership and it had a strong influence in rendering possible the extensive formation of the women's clubs which became so important a feature in American society. Its work was partly chronicled in two large volumes which gave the papers presented and action taken at the meetings. By 1902, the many great organizations of women which had been established made further work on the part of the A.A.W. unnecessary.

Establishment.
Several eminent, philanthropic women proposed and attempted to secure the general cooperation of American women who, widely severed, were toiling alone to conquer giant difficulties in new fields of labor and reform. Only uncertain tradition tells us of their aims and efforts. It was under <a href="Sorosis">Sorosis</a> that this began to change.

At a regular meeting of Sorosis, on April 21, 1873, it was proposed by the Executive Committee to hold a Woman's Congress in the following October, under the auspices of Sorosis, for the promotion of more perfect cooperation and good fellowship among women engaged in kindred objects and pursuits.

At a social meeting held June 2, <a href="Charlotte%20Beebe%20Wilbour">Charlotte Beebe Wilbour</a> (1833–1914), President, recommended that Sorosis address a circular letter to practical representative women interested in higher education, and all questions of like importance to women. She suggested that those best-fitted might prepare papers to be read, that resolutions on practical subjects relating to the welfare of women might be offered, discussed and acted upon, and that mutual counsel and help might be rendered.

It was voted that the Call be issued in July, for a Congress to be held in October. 

On August 25th, a meeting of the Executive Committee was convened. The Committee felt encouraged to proceed with the arrangements for the proposed Congress. Wilbour suggested that means be taken to solicit letters from all earnest women, especially from those struggling in obscurity for the right. It was voted that the Call express the desire to form an Association for the Advancement of Woman, and that numbers shall not be the object of the Congress, but the gathering of the earnest few who shall constitute a deliberative assembly, to confer concerning the best interests of their sex.

On September 1, 1873, the following Call was issued:
To MEET a pressing demand for interchange of thought and harmony of action among women interested in the advancement of their own sex, we issue this call for a Congress of Women, to be held in the City of New York. At this Conference we hope to found an Association for the Advancement of Women, at the annual gatherings of which shall be presented the best ideas and the most advantageous methods of our foremost thinkers and writers. Therefore, we solicit the presence or responsive word of all accordant associations of women—of women Preachers, Teachers, Professors, Physicians, Artists, Lawyers, Trading Capitalists, Editors, Authors, and practical Philanthropists, those who by their example inspire others not only to covet earnestly the best gifts, but to labor earnestly for them. In this first gathering we are already assured of the attendance and best efforts of a goodly number of the pre-eminently talented, cultivated and beneficent women who, by means of higher education, broader fields of industry, better laws, artistic and scientific pursuits, business discipline, and an enlightened motherhood, hope to remove the sources of misery, and cure the evils that so many of our benevolent women spend their lives in ameliorating. Those whose names are appended to this Call will constitute the first membership. Application for membership may be made to any signer of this Call. A preliminary meeting of members only will be held on Tuesday, October 14th. The hour and place of this meeting, and of the subsequent sessions, which will occupy the three following days, will be advertised in the daily papers. 

Subjects for papers and discussion included:

On September 26th, the Committee reported a hearty response to the Call from all parts of the country far exceeding their expectations, and that the class of women who had given their names for this work, warrant the Committee in believing that the movement is destined to be a grand success; that its deliberations will be earnest and intelligent, and will be conducted in such a calm, rational, temperate and Christian spirit as to compel the respect of the world at large. It was voted that Sorosis donate US$l00 toward the expenses of the Congress. Voted, also, that a subscription list be opened to assist in defraying expenses. Local Committee reported that Wilbour had written, to date, 160 letters, dictated 40, had sent 150 Messengers and 200 Calls; the Secretary had written 280 letters to women in. the United States and in Europe, had sent about 700 Messengers and Calls; Mrs. Poole had written 80 letters, making a total of 1,620 letters, Messengers and Calls sent out.

Early history.
The First Congress was held at the Union League Theatre, New York, October 15-17, 1873. <a href="Mary%20A.%20Livermore">Mary A. Livermore</a> was elected president. The Second Congress was held at <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, October 15-17, 1874 and Prof. <a href="Maria%20Mitchell">Maria Mitchell</a>, of <a href="Vassar%20College">Vassar College</a> was elected president. The Third Congress was held at <a href="Syracuse%2C%20New%20York">Syracuse, New York</a>, October 13-15, 1875 and Prof. Mitchell was re-elected president.

By the 1880 Congress, the value of the Association was more and more seen to consist in the skilled, but impromptu discussion after each paper, and in the real importance of the Executive Sessions, where each State, through its representative, made known its educational and social progress during the year. Thus, there was an intercommunication of knowledge which aided in creating a national feeling of rejoicing at the welfare of other States. The Congress developed obedience to parliamentary law, patriotic sentiment, and general knowledge of American philanthropy in its many practical phases.

3ω-method

The 3ω-method (3 omega method) or 3ω-technique, is a measurement method for determining the <a href="List%20of%20thermal%20conductivities">thermal conductivities</a> of bulk material (i.e. solid or liquid) and thin layers. The process involves a metal heater applied to the sample that is heated periodically. The temperature oscillations thus produced are then measured. The thermal conductivity and <a href="thermal%20diffusivity">thermal diffusivity</a> of the sample can be determined from their frequency dependence. The process was first published by David Cahill and Robert Pohl in the April 1987 issue of the <a href="Physical%20Review">Physical Review</a> in a paper titled "Thermal Conductivity of Amorphous Solids above the Plateau".

Moggridgea rainbowi

Moggridgea rainbowi, also called the Australian trapdoor spider, is a small spider endemic to <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>. The spider was first recorded in 1919.

Distribution.
The spider's habitat is in burrows just above the high tide mark. The spider has been identified and studied from two sites on Kangaroo Island; the genomes from the two sites 80km apart indicate that the groups diverged 1 to 6 million years ago, reflective of juveniles not migrating far from their maternal sites. The most closely related species is considered to be the African "<a href="Moggridgea%20Intermedia">M. intermedia</a>".

A study has indicated that "M. rainbowi" is likely to have reached Australia from Africa between 2 and 16 million years ago. Given that this time is intermediate between the separation of Australia from Gwondwana (circa 95 million years ago) and the arrival of humans into Australia, it has been proposed that the spiders may have arrived by <a href="oceanic%20dispersal">oceanic dispersal</a>, such as by rafting vegetation.

Mormon Tips

Mormon Tips is a project of the non-profit organization <a href="Rights%20Equal%20Rights">Rights Equal Rights</a> (RER)—formerly called Californians Against Hate. Mormon Tips was started in January 2017 by RER founder <a href="Fred%20Karger">Fred Karger</a> as a way to collect evidence of tax fraud by the LDS Church submitted from anonymous sources. The organization will then use the gathered information to file a complaint with the IRS in order to revoke the LDS Church's tax-exempt status.

History.
The founder of Mormon Tips and RER, Fred Karger, first began a campaign opposing political activities of the LDS church while running for the US presidency in 2011, with outspoken opposition to the church's efforts to block efforts for the legal recognition of same-sex marriages. He picketed LDS stores and bookstores, and filed a formal complaint with the <a href="List%20of%20California%20state%20agencies">California Fair Political Practices Commission</a> (FPPC) against the LDS Church, accusing the church of hiding the extent of its financial involvement supporting Proposition 8. Karger noticed discrepancies between the $2,078 worth of non-monetary contributions that the LDS Church had reported and all the activities that the church had undertaken to pass Proposition 8. Roman Porter, the executive director of the FPPC, announced a full investigation later that month. The investigation examined the church’s involvement in providing phone banks, a website and commercials for Proposition 8, ultimately finding the church guilty of 13 violations, which the LDS Church settled by paying a fine. Inspired by the <a href="WikiLeaks">WikiLeaks</a> project, Karger launched Mormon Tips as a way to gather evidence to oppose the political actions of the LDS Church by seeking to revoke its tax-exempt status.

RAISE Act

The RAISE (Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment) Act is a bill introduced in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> in 2017. Co-sponsored by <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> senators <a href="Tom%20Cotton">Tom Cotton</a> and <a href="David%20Perdue">David Perdue</a>, the bill seeks to reduce levels of legal <a href="immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">immigration to the United States</a> by 50% by halving the number of <a href="Permanent%20residence%20%28United%20States%29">green cards</a> issued. The bill would also impose a cap of 50,000 <a href="refugee">refugee</a> admissions a year and would end the <a href="Diversity%20Immigrant%20Visa">visa diversity lottery</a>. The bill received the support of President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, who promoted a revised version of the bill in August 2017, but was opposed by Democrats, immigrant rights groups, and some Republicans. 

History.
The bill is co-sponsored by <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> senators <a href="Tom%20Cotton">Tom Cotton</a> of Arkansas and <a href="David%20Perdue">David Perdue</a> of Georgia, who introduced the bill to the Senate on February 13, 2017, as S. 354. The bill was referred to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Senate Committee on the Judiciary</a>.

On August 2, 2017, Cotton introduced a revised version of the bill, designated S. 1720; this bill was also referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, along with Cotton and Perdue, announced it at the White House. Within the Trump White House, Trump advisers <a href="Stephen%20Miller%20%28political%20advisor%29">Stephen Miller</a> and <a href="Steve%20Bannon">Steve Bannon</a> promoted and helped shape the bill. The odds of the bill being enacted are seen as remote. The bill has not attracted any additional co-sponsors, and Republican leaders in Congress have no plans to vote on immigration in 2017.

Provisions and analysis.
The bill would cut the legal immigration by half, reducing the number of <a href="Permanent%20residence%20%28United%20States%29">green cards</a> from more than 1 million to about 500,000. The bill would also remove pathways for siblings and adult children of <a href="U.S.%20citizens">U.S. citizens</a> and legal permanent residents to apply for permanent lawful residency status in the U.S., limiting the family path to spouses and minor children. The bill would also impose a cap of 50,000 <a href="refugee">refugee</a> admissions a year and would end the <a href="Diversity%20Immigrant%20Visa">visa diversity lottery</a>.

In promoting the legislation, Trump administration officials contend that the bill would increase economic growth and increase wages. This contention was challenged by economists, who "overwhelmingly predict" that cuts in immigration would have a negative impact on GDP growth. In April 2017, a group of more than 1,400 economists, with views ranging across the political spectrum, sent an open letter to Trump noting the "near universal agreement" on "the <a href="Economic%20results%20of%20migration">broad economic benefit that immigrants to this country bring</a>" and urging him not to seek immigration cuts. The Penn Wharton Budget Model projects that the RAISE Act would increase per-capita GDP by 0.02 percent in the first decade, before falling in the <a href="long%20run">long run</a> by 2040. <a href="Cato%20Institute">Cato Institute</a> immigration policy analyst <a href="Alex%20Nowrasteh">Alex Nowrasteh</a> said that the legislation "would do nothing to boost skilled immigration and it will only increase the proportion of employment-based green cards by cutting other green cards. Saying otherwise is grossly deceptive marketing." 

The "only evidence that the administration has cited as justifying its proposals" is the work of economist <a href="George%20Borjas">George Borjas</a>, who has defended the bill, arguing that it "makes sense" and that "low-skill immigration, which would likely suffer the largest cuts in the proposed bill, imposes costs on taxpayers and it imposes costs on low-skill workers already here." Other economists have sharply contested Borjas's conclusions; economist <a href="Giovanni%20Peri">Giovanni Peri</a> stated that "The average American worker is more likely to lose than to gain from immigration restrictions" and "most studies put the negative impact on low-skilled wages closer to zero," and <a href="Michael%20Clemens">Michael Clemens</a> argues that Borjas's position is based on a study with critical flaws.

Support and opposition.
The bill and Trump's support for it was hailed by groups favoring restrictive immigration policies, such as <a href="NumbersUSA">NumbersUSA</a> and the <a href="Federation%20for%20American%20Immigration%20Reform">Federation for American Immigration Reform</a>. <a href="CNBC">CNBC</a> journalist <a href="John%20Harwood%20%28journalist%29">John Harwood</a> viewed the bill as an appeal to Trump's anti-immigration <a href="Base%20%28politics%29">base</a> of Republican voters.

The bill is opposed by <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> as well as some Republicans. <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> chairman <a href="Tom%20Perez">Tom Perez</a> said that "Trump wants to tear apart communities and punish immigrant families that are making valuable contributions to our economy." Democratic Senator <a href="Richard%20Blumenthal">Richard Blumenthal</a> of Connecticut called the bill "nothing but a series of <a href="Nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a> talking points and regurgitated campaign rhetoric that completely fails to move our nation forward toward real reform." Seven of the eight Senators in the bipartisan "<a href="Gang%20of%20Eight%20%28immigration%29">Gang of Eight</a>" (four Democrats and four Republicans who co-sponsored a <a href="Border%20Security%2C%20Economic%20Opportunity%2C%20and%20Immigration%20Modernization%20Act%20of%202013">unsuccessful immigration-reform bill</a>) denounced the bill. Republican Senator <a href="Lindsey%20Graham">Lindsey Graham</a>, for example, a member of the Gang of Eight, said the proposal would be "devastating" to South Carolina's economy. The eighth member of the Gang of Eight, Republican Senator <a href="Marco%20Rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, said that he had "a big difference of opinion with this bill is that it sets an arbitrary cap on the number of people that are able to come through with a green card."

The <a href="Congressional%20Hispanic%20Caucus">Congressional Hispanic Caucus</a> and immigrant rights groups both condemned the legislation. The <a href="National%20Immigration%20Law%20Center">National Immigration Law Center</a> called the bill "cruel and un-American" and issued a statement saying that it would "devastate families, eliminating the traditional and long-accepted means by which family members such as grandparents, mothers, fathers and siblings are able to reunite with their families who have emigrated to the United States." The <a href="technology%20industry">technology industry</a> immigration-policy advocacy group <a href="FWD.us">FWD.us</a> said the bill, if enacted, "would severely harm the economy and actually depress wages for Americans." The <a href="Association%20of%20Public%20and%20Land-grant%20Universities">Association of Public and Land-grant Universities</a> and also oppose the bill, describing it as flawed and a step backward. The <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a> also opposed the legislation, calling it "cruel, anti-family and un-American."

Regrelor (also known as INS50589) is an experimental <a href="antiplatelet%20drug">antiplatelet drug</a> that was under investigation by <a href="Merck%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Merck Sharp and Dohme</a> in human <a href="clinical%20trials">clinical trials</a>. Although it was initially found to be well-tolerated in healthy subjects, safety concerns lead to cessation of clinical trials. 

Medical uses.
Regrelor is an experimental drug. It is classified as an antiplatelet medication. It was under investigation for use in <a href="thrombosis">blood clotting</a> problems, as well as during <a href="coronary%20artery%20bypass%20surgery">coronary artery bypass surgery</a>.
Available forms.
Regrelor is available in an <a href="intravenous">intravenous</a> formulation.

Pharmacology.
Regrelor is classified as an <a href="P2Y12">purinergic P2 receptor</a> (P2Y) <a href="Adenosine%20diphosphate%20receptor%20inhibitor">antagonist</a>. Other compounds in the same mechanistic class include <a href="clopidogrel">clopidogrel</a> and <a href="ticagrelor">ticagrelor</a>. It is characterized as a <a href="Receptor%20antagonist%23Reversibility">reversible</a>, <a href="Competitive%20antagonist">competitive</a> receptor antagonist. The <a href="IC50">IC50</a> for antagonism of ADP-induced (P2Y-mediated) platelet aggregation was 16 nM "in vitro".

Regrelor's <a href="primary%20metabolite">primary metabolite</a> is called INS51088.

Chemistry.
Regrelor is structurally similar to <a href="Adenosine%20monophosphate">AMP</a>, just like <a href="ticagrelor">ticagrelor</a>. Regrelor has 4 <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a> donors and 11 acceptors. It is produced as a di<a href="sodium">sodium</a> salt. The two <a href="sodium">sodium</a> atoms bind the negatively charged <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> moiety in solution.
Synthesis.
Regrelor was synthesized from <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">adenosine diphosphate</a> (ADP), an endogenous chemical involved in <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>. The authors noted that the addition of a lipophilic moiety like <a href="cinnamaldehyde">cinnamaldehyde</a> at the C-2' and C-3' positions, combined with ethylurea at N-6 on the <a href="adenine">adenine</a> base, yielded regrelor.

History.
Regrelor was developed around the same time as <a href="prasugrel">prasugrel</a> and <a href="cangrelor">cangrelor</a>. After Inspire Pharmaceuticals initially developed the drug, it was purchased by Merck Sharp and Dohme.

Research.
In a phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by Merck Sharp and Dohme Corporation, regrelor was well-tolerated in healthy volunteers. In 2008, phase 2 trials were discontinued. It is believed that further development of the drug was ceased due to safety reasons. In the trial, there was an increased risk of <a href="bleeding">bleeding</a> for patients on regrelor.

Partial/total <a href="Solar%20eclipses">Solar eclipses</a> on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> are caused when the <a href="Earth">Earth</a> passes in front of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, blocking a part its light in one part and the whole light in the other. Viewers on Earth will see a <a href="partial%20lunar%20eclipse">partial lunar eclipse</a>.

During its eclipses, the Earth will be in new phase, completely dark, except for <a href="earthshine">moonshine</a> and sunlight refracted through the earth's atmosphere, visible as a ring of light.

The next partial-total solar eclipse on the Moon will be partial-total on August 7, 2017 with the southern portion of the Southern Hemisphere seeing totality.

Description.
Seen on Earth as a partial lunar eclipse, unlike the Earth where a total eclipse only occurs in a small spot while the remainder of a solar eclipse are total, on the Moon, a part is shown as partial and a part is shown is total as the center of the Earth's shadow's coverage totality is more larger than the Moon on Earth. In some eclipses, about 15-20% of a surface of the moon covered by the center of the Earth's shadow sees totality where the Earth eclipses the sun, some eclipses has about 75-80% of the surface covered by the center of the Earth's shadow while the remainder visilbly as partial, some has 50/50 covered by the center of the Earth's shadow and visibly as partial.

Length.
The shortest can be for around 2 hours and the longest can be up to 5–6 hours.

List of partial/total solar eclipses on the Moon.

Alauddin Khilji's conquest of Gujarat

In 1299, the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> led by <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a> ransacked the <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> region of India, which was ruled by the <a href="Vaghela%20dynasty">Vaghela</a> king <a href="Karna%20%28Vaghela%20dynasty%29">Karna</a>. The Delhi forces plundered several major cities of Gujarat, including <a href="Anahilavada">Anahilavada</a> (Patan), <a href="Khambhat">Khambhat</a>, <a href="Surat">Surat</a> and <a href="Somnath">Somnath</a>. Karna was able to regain control of at least a part of his kingdom in the later years. However, in 1304, a second invasion by Alauddin's forces permanently ended the Vaghela dynasty, and resulted in the annexation of Gujarat to the Delhi Sultanate.

Background.
After becoming the Sultan of Delhi in 1296, Alauddin Khilji spent a few years consolidating his power. Once he had strengthened his control over the Indo-Gangetic plains, he decided to invade Gujarat, which was one of the wealthiest regions of India, because of its fertile soil and the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20trade">Indian Ocean trade</a>. Moreover, a large number of Muslim traders lived in the port cities of Gujarat. This would make it convenient for the Muslim merchants of north India to participate in international trade.

At that time, Gujarat was ruled by the <a href="Vaghela%20dynasty">Vaghela</a> king Karnadeva (called Rai Karan by the Muslim chroniclers). According to the 14th century Jain chronicler <a href="Merutunga">Merutunga</a>'s "Vichara-shreni", Karna's <a href="Nagar%20Brahmin">Nagara</a> minister Madhava brought the invaders to Gujarat. The 15th century text "<a href="Kanhadade%20Prabandha">Kanhadade Prabandha</a>" also states that the Vaghela king had humiliated Madhava, killed his brother Keshava, and abducted his wife. Seeking revenge, Madhava went to Delhi and urged Alauddin to help him wage a war against the Vaghela king. This account is also supported by the 17th century chronicler <a href="Munhot%20Nainsi">Munhot Nainsi</a>. This account seems to be based on historical truth, and may explain why Alauddin could invade Gujarat without subjugating the kingdoms which acted as a buffer between Delhi and Gujarat.

1299 invasion.
March to Gujarat.
On 25 February 1299, Alauddin ordered his army to prepare for the march to Gujarat. One section of the army started its march from Delhi, led by Nusrat Khan. Another section, led by <a href="Ulugh%20Khan">Ulugh Khan</a>, marched from <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a>, attacking <a href="Jaisalmer">Jaisalmer</a> along the way. The two sections met somewhere near <a href="Chittor">Chittor</a>, and then marched to Gujarat through <a href="Mewar">Mewar</a>. Different medieval chroniclers given different dates (ranging from 1298 to 1300) for the start of the Delhi army's march. An inscription found at <a href="Somnath">Somnath</a> clearly indicates that a battle took place there in June 1299. Hence, the invasion would have definitely started before this date.

During this march, Alauddin's generals seem to have raided a portion of the <a href="Guhilas%20of%20Medapata">Guhila</a> territory of Mewar. The Jain writer Jina Prabha Suri states that the Guhila king Samarasimha protected his territory from Alauddin's forces. The 1439 Ranpur inscription describes one Bhuvanasimha as "the conqueror of <a href="Shri">Shri</a> Allavadina Sultan". Bhuvanasimha belonged to the <a href="Sisodia">Sisodia</a> branch of the Guhilas, and may have served as a feudatory of Samarasimha. The Delhi army did not seem to have suffered any serious reverses against the Guhilas, as they were able to easily capture Gujarat sometime later. It appears that a column of the Delhi army carried out a light raid in the Guhila territory, and met with strong resistance.

After crossing the <a href="Banas%20River">Banas River</a>, Alauddin's forces captured a fort called Radosa.

Invasion.
The sudden invasion from Delhi appears to have been a surprise for the Vaghela king Karna. Alauddin's army captured Gujarat easily in a very short time, which indicates that either Karna was unpopular among his subjects, or he had an ineffective military and administrative setup.

The Jain chronicler Jinaprabha Suri states that Ulugh Khan's forces defeated Karna's army at Ashapalli (present-day Ahmedabad). According to the 14th century historian <a href="Abdul%20Malik%20Isami">Isami</a>, Karna took shelter in a fort, which was besieged by the Delhi army. His ministers told him that there was no alternative to fleeing Gujarat, and advised him to come back after the departure of the invaders. According to Barani, Karna fled to <a href="Devagiri">Devagiri</a>, the capital of the neighbouring <a href="Seuna%20%28Yadava%29%20dynasty">Yadava</a> kingdom. However, historian <a href="Peter%20Jackson%20%28historian%29">Peter Jackson</a> believes that Barani's statement is inaccurate: Karna fled to Devagiri only during the later 1304 invasion.

Plunder.
Ulugh Khan's army thoroughly sacked the wealthy capital city of <a href="Anahilavada">Anahilavada</a> (modern Patan, called Nahrwala in Muslim chronicles). Karna's wealth and his wives, including his chief queen Kamala Devi, were captured by the invaders.

Nusrat Khan marched to the wealthy port city of <a href="Khambhat">Khambhat</a>, where he obtained a great amount of wealth from the local merchants and other rich people. There, he also forcibly obtained the slave <a href="Malik%20Kafur">Malik Kafur</a>, who had been purchased by his original master for 1000 <a href="gold%20dinar">dinars</a>. Malik Kafur later led Alauddin's campaigns in <a href="Deccan">Deccan</a>.

According to Jinaprabha, Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan destroyed hundreds of towns, including Asavalli (near modern <a href="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a>), <a href="Vanthali">Vanmanthali</a> and <a href="Surat">Surat</a>. The invaders also looted several monasteries, palaces and temples. This account is also confirmed by the Delhi Sultanate chronicler <a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Ziauddin Barani</a>. Isami states that the invading soldiers even dug out the treasures hidden underground by the locals.

Somnath.
Another section marched towards the reputed <a href="Somnath">Somnath</a> temple, hoping to plunder gold from there. The temple had earlier been destroyed by <a href="Mahmud%20of%20Ghazni">Mahmud of Ghazni</a> in the 11th century, but had since been re-built.

The Delhi army met with resistance at Somnath. An inscription records that two "Vāja" warriors named Malasuta and Padamala died at the door of the Somanatha temple on 6 June 1299, while fighting the <a href="Turushka">Turushka</a>s (the Turkic people).

After subjugating the defenders, Alauddin's army demolished the temple. According to the contemporary chronicler <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>, the temple was bent into the direction of <a href="Kaaba">Kaaba</a> (<a href="qibla">qibla</a>). The invaders looted the temple's wealth, and carried its main idol to Delhi, where it was thrown to be trampled under the feet of Muslims.

Mutiny near Jalore.
Nusrat Khan and Ulugh Khan returned to Delhi with a huge amount of wealth and prisoners, including <a href="Malik%20Kafur">Malik Kafur</a> and the Vaghela queen Kamala Devi. The individual soldiers in the Delhi army had also managed to gathered their own loot. When the army halted at Sakarne near <a href="Jalore">Jalore</a> on its way to Delhi, the generals ordered these soldiers to pay "<a href="khums">khums</a>" (one-fifth of the share of loot). Some of the soldiers tried to conceal the true amount of wealth looted by them, leading to disputes. The generals punished several soldiers. According to the 15th century text "Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi" (written by Yahya), these soldiers were put under bellows, forced to drink saline water, and beaten with fists and rods.

As a result, a section of the army revolted against the generals. The mutineers were mostly "neo-Muslims", the Mongols (Mughals), who had converted to Islam recently. According to the 14th century historian Isami, the revolt was led by Muhammad Shah, Kabhru, Yalhaq and Burraq. According to the 15th century historian Yahya, it was led by Iljak, Kasri, Begi, Tamghan, Muhammad Shah, Timur Bagha, Shadi Bugha and Qutlugh Bugha. The 17th century chronicler <a href="Munhot%20Nainsi">Munhot Nainsi</a> states that three days before the mutiny, the rebel leaders had met <a href="Samantasimha">Samantasimha</a>, the <a href="Chahamanas%20of%20Jalor">Chahamana</a> ruler of Jalore. On the day of the mutiny, the rebels attacked the generals' camp from one side, while the Chahamana army attacked it from the other side. The veracity of Nainsi's account is doubtful, as he inaccurately states that Alauddin personally led the Delhi army during this campaign, and was present at the time of the mutiny.

The mutiny began when the rebels murdered Malik A'izzudin, who was a brother of Nusrat Khan and the secretary of Ulugh Khan. The next day, around 2000-3000 of them attacked the camp of Ulugh Khan, who managed to escape, as he was in a <a href="toilet%20%28room%29">lavatory</a>. The attackers killed a son of Alauddin's sister, mistaking him for Ulugh Khan. Ulugh Khan escaped to Nusrat Khan's tent, where drums were beaten to assemble the loyal soldiers. These loyal soldiers forced the rebels to retreat.

The rebellion was completely suppressed within 4 days. The mutiny had terrified the royal generals, who quickly resumed their march to Delhi, without making any further "khums" demands. Two of the rebel leaders — Muhammad Shah and Kabhru — sought asylum with <a href="Hammiradeva">Hammiradeva</a>, the <a href="Chahamanas%20of%20Ranastambhapura">Chahamana</a> ruler of Ranastambhapura (modern <a href="Ranthambore">Ranthambore</a>). Two other rebel readers — Yalhaq and Burraq — sought shelter with the Vaghela king Karna.

When Alauddin heard about the mutiny, he ordered the arrests of the wives and children of the mutineers in Delhi. Nusrat Khan meted out especially brutal punishment to the wives and children of the individuals who had murdered his brother A'izzudin: the children were cut into pieces in front of their mothers, and the women were killed and fed to the <a href="scavenger">scavenger</a>s. These brutal punishments shocked the near-contemporary chronicler <a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Ziauddin Barani</a>, who declared that no religion allowed such acts. According to him, the practice of punishing wives and children for the crimes of men started with this incident in Delhi.

1304 invasion.
Karna seems to have recaptured at least a part of his former territory in the later years. An inscription found at the Sampla village in Gujarat attests that he was ruling at Patan on 4 August 1304. The Jain author <a href="Merutunga">Merutunga</a> also states that he ruled up to 1304 CE.

The 14th century Muslim chronicler <a href="Isami%20%28historian%29">Isami</a> also suggests that Karna managed to regain his power. According to Isami, Alauddin had handed over the administration of the newly-captured <a href="Ranthambore%20Fort">Ranthambore Fort</a> to Malik Shahin in 1301. But sometime later, Malik Shahin fled the fort because he was afraid of Karna, who ruled the neighbouring territory. Karna was supported by the neo-Muslim Mongol "<a href="emir">amirs</a>", who had rebelled against Alauddin's generals at Jalore.

Accounts of various chroniclers.
According to <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>'s poem "Ashiqa", Karna and his queen Kamala Devi had a daughter named Devala Devi ("Dewal Di"). After the 1299 invasion, Kamala Devi was taken to Delhi, and inducted into Alauddin's <a href="harem">harem</a>. Eight years later, she requested Alauddin to get Devala Devi from Gujarat. Alauddin sent a message to Karna, and Karna agreed to oblige. He was preparing to send Devala Devi to Delhi with many presents, but then he came to know that a large Delhi army led by Ulugh Khan and Panchami had been sent to conquer Gujarat. He then sought asylum from the <a href="Seuna%20%28Yadava%29%20dynasty">Yadava</a> prince Shankaradeva ("Sankh Deo"), a son of <a href="Ramachandra%20of%20Devagiri">Ramachandra of Devagiri</a> ("Ram Deo"). Shankaradeva agreed to help him, but on the condition that he would marry Devala Devi. Karna unwillingly accepted the condition. But before he could send her to Devagiri, Panchami's army captured her. She was sent to Delhi, where fell in love with the 10-year old Khizr Khan. Despite objections from Khizr Khan's mother, the two later married.

The 14th century chronicler Isami gives a slightly different account of events. According to him, Alauddin's forces returned to Delhi after plundering Gujarat, and Karna re-occupied his capital. Later, Alauddin sent an army led by Malik Ahmad Jhitam (alias Qara Beg) and an officer named Panchmani. This army decisively defeated Karna, who fled to the Yadava kingdom ("Marhat" or Maharashtra). However, he failed to find asylum there, and moved on to the Kakatiya kingdom ("Tilang" or Telangana). The Kakatiya ruler Rudradeva ("Luddar Dev") granted him asylum. Meanwhile, Malik Jhitam returned to Delhi with the wives and daughters of Karna, including Devala Devi. Alauddin granted Gujarat as an "<a href="iqta%27">iqta'</a>" to his brother-in-law Alp Khan, who came from <a href="Multan">Multan</a> and became the governor of Gujarat. Isami does not mention Kamala Devi.

<a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Ziauddin Barani</a>, another 14th century chronicler, does not mention the second invasion in his "Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi". He states that Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan plundered Gujarat, after Karna fled to the Devagiri. The two generals later returned to Delhi with the wives and daughters of Karna. Barani, however, does not mention Devala Devi's name. Another medieval writer Nizam ud-Din gives a similar account, and mentions the capture of Devala Devi ("Dewal"). But he ignores the rest of the "Ashiqa" narrative. Like Isami, he does not mention Kamala Devi at all.

The 16th century historian <a href="%60Abd%20al-Qadir%20Bada%27uni">`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni</a> follows Barani's account, but presents a part of the "Ashiqa" account as history, but does not mention Kamala Devi. Bada'uni's contemporary Firishta combines all the previous accounts to present the following narrative: the first invasion of Gujarat was led by Alauddin's generals Aluf Khan (Alp Khan) and Nusrat Khan. They captured Kamala Devi ("Kowla Devy") and other wives and daughters of Karna, who sought shelter with <a href="Ramachandra%20of%20Devagiri">Ramachandra of Devagiri</a>. With Ramachandra's help, Karna became the ruler of a principality called Baglana in Gujarat, located on the border of the Yadava territory. In 1308, Alauddin sent Malik Kafur to subjugate Ramachandra. At this time, Kamala Devi requested him to bring her daughter Devala Devi ("Deval Devy") to Delhi. Malik Kafur reached Deccan, and asked Karna to surrender Devala Devi. However, Karna refused to do so and warded off the invaders in the mountain passes for two months. Ultimately, he decided to marry his daughter to Ramachandra's son Shankaradeva ("Shunkul Dev"). While an officer named Bhimadeva ("Bhim Deo") was escorting Devala to Shankaradeva, some Muslim soldiers visiting <a href="Ellora">Ellora</a> chanced upon his contingent. The Muslim soldiers captured Devala Devi, and took her to Aluf Khan. Ultimately, Devala Devi was sent to Delhi, where she married Khizr Khan.

Historical accuracy.
The most accurate among all these accounts seems to be that of Isami, who spent considerable time in the Deccan region. Amir Khusrau's "Ashiqa", which is of little historical value, states that the second invasion was led by Ulugh Khan (not Malik Jhitam). However, if the dates given by the 16th century historian <a href="Firishta">Firishta</a> are accepted as correct, Ulugh Khan had already died by this time. On the other hand, Isami states that the invasion was led by Malik Jhitam.

The "Ashiqa" states that a mother Kamala Devi asked Alauddin to snatch her young daughter from her biological father. It goes on to claim that Karna not only readily agreed to this demand, but also decided to send some presents with her to Delhi. These claims, which imply that the Vaghelas had no sense of honour and chastity, seem absurd. Even Bada'uni, who placed a high value on the historicity of "Ashiqa", chose to ignore these claims in his writings. Firishta also refused to repeat Khsurau's statement that Karna was preparing to send presents with his daughter to Delhi. Similarly, Khusrau's claim that Devala Devi fell in love with her father's biggest enemy seems unlikely.

Also, it is unlikely that the Yadava king Ramachandra granted refuge to Karna. The Yadavas were enemies of the Chaulukyas-Vaghelas. Moreover, Ramachandra paid tribute to Alauddin in 1299, and some years later, even supported Alauddin's forces in their campaign against his other enemies, such as the <a href="Hoysalas">Hoysalas</a>. Considering all these points, Isami's statement that Karna had to seek refuge from the Kakatiyas seems correct.

Karna (Vaghela dynasty)

Karna (r. c. 1296 – c. 1304) was the last <a href="Vaghela%20dynasty">Vaghela</a> king of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> region in India. Little is known about his life except <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji%27s%20conquest%20of%20Gujarat">his defeat</a> against <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a> of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>. Alauddin's forces ransacked his kingdom in 1299, forcing him to flee Gujarat. Karna seems to have gained control of at least some part of his territory in the subsequent years. However, a second invasion in 1304 resulted in the end of the Vaghela dynasty.

Early life.
Karna was a son of the Vaghela king Rama. Variations of his name include Karnadeva (in Vaghela inscriptions), Rai Karan (in Muslim chronicles), and Karan Dev (in vernacular literature). He is also known as Karna II to distinguish him from the <a href="Chaulukya">Chaulukya</a> king <a href="Karna%20%28Chaulukya%20dynasty%29">Karna</a>. The Portuguese historian <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20de%20Barros">João de Barros</a> calls him "Galacarna".

Karna succeeded his uncle Saragadeva (the brother of Rama) on the throne. Sarangadeva's kingdom included the present-day Gujarat, and also extended up to <a href="Mount%20Abu">Abu</a> in present-day Rajasthan. Karna appears to have inherited this entire territory. Aside from his defeat against Alauddin Khilji, very little is known about his reign.

Defeat against Alauddin Khilji.
In 1299, <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a> of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> invaded Gujarat, which was one of the wealthiest regions of India. According to medieval chronicles (such as <a href="Merutunga">Merutunga</a>'s "Vichara-shreni" and <a href="Padman%C4%81bha">Padmanābha</a>'s "<a href="Kanhadade%20Prabandha">Kanhadade Prabandha</a>"), Karna had abducted the wife of his minister Madhava and killed Madhava's brother. In revenge, Madhava instigated Alauddin to invade Gujarat.

The invasion appears to have been a surprise for Karna, as Alauddin's army captured Gujarat easily in a very short time. This suggests that either Karna was unpopular among his subjects, or he had an ineffective military and administrative setup. The Jain chronicler Jinaprabha Suri states that Ulugh Khan's forces defeated Karna's army at Ashapalli (present-day Ahmedabad). According to the 14th century historian <a href="Abdul%20Malik%20Isami">Isami</a>, Karna took shelter in a fort, which was besieged by the Delhi army. His ministers told him that there was no alternative to fleeing Gujarat, and advised him to come back after the departure of the invaders. Ultimately, Karna fled to <a href="Devagiri">Devagiri</a>, the capital of the neighbouring <a href="Seuna%20%28Yadava%29%20dynasty">Yadava</a> kingdom. A section of the Delhi army pursued him. The 14th century chronicler Isami states that he was refused asylum by the Yadavas, and had to seek shelter from the <a href="Kakatiya">Kakatiya</a> ruler <a href="Rudradeva">Rudradeva</a>. Meanwhile, the Delhi army plundered the wealthy cities of Gujarat, including the capital <a href="Anahilavada">Anahilavada</a> (modern Patan), <a href="Khambhat">Khambhat</a>, <a href="Surat">Surat</a> and <a href="Somnath">Somnath</a>.

Subsequently, Karna seems to have recaptured at least some part of Gujarat. An inscription found at the Sampla village in Gujarat attests that he was ruling at Patan on 4 August 1304. The Jain author Merutunga also states that he ruled up to 1304 CE. The 14th century Muslim chronicler Isami also suggests that Karna managed to regain his power. According to Isami, Alauddin had handed over the administration of the newly-captured <a href="Ranthambore%20Fort">Ranthambore Fort</a> to Malik Shahin in 1301. But sometime later, Malik Shahin fled the fort because he was afraid of Karna, who ruled the neighbouring territory.

Karna lost his throne permanently after a second invasion from Delhi in 1304. According to <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>'s poem "Ashiqa", the invasion resulted from a request by Karna's former wife Kamala Devi, who had been captured by Alauddin's forces during the first invasion. Eight years after being inducted into Alauddin's <a href="harem">harem</a>, Kamala Devi requested Alauddin to get her daughter <a href="Devala%20Devi">Devala Devi</a> from Gujarat. Although Karna agreed to the demand, Alauddin ordered his army to invade Gujarat for a second time. "Ashiqa" is not historically reliable, but some of the later medieval writers present its narrative as history. Other medieval chroniclers give different accounts of this incident, some of them omitting the bit about Kamala Devi's request.

Descendants.
The ultimate fate of Karna is unknown, and no concrete information is available about his descendants. A 1498 CE inscription shows that a family of the Vaghela clan was ruling at a place called Dandahi, as subordinates of the Muslim ruler <a href="Mahmud%20Begada">Mahmud Begada</a>. The rulers of the <a href="Rewa%20State">Rewa State</a> also claimed descent from the Vaghelas through one Bhimadeva.

In popular culture.
Karna is mentioned in several medieval Muslim chronicles that describe Alauddin's conquest of Gujarat.

<doc id="54738493" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54738493" title="Union County Courthouse (Illinois)">
Union County Courthouse (Illinois)

The Union County Courthouse is a government building in central <a href="Jonesboro%2C%20Illinois">Jonesboro</a>, the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of <a href="Union%20County%2C%20Illinois">Union County</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Built in 2013, it replaced a brick structure whose core predated the Civil War.

Early history.
Civilization first reached the vicinity of Union County by means of a French expedition under <a href="Louis%20Jolliet">Jolliet</a> and <a href="Jacques%20Marquette">Marquette</a> in 1673; they are unlikely to have landed within Union County's current boundaries, but they are known to have explored the lower end of the <a href="Upper%20Mississippi%20River">Upper Mississippi River</a>. The first settlement, consisting of two families who built cabins near the present site of Jonesboro in 1803, was followed by a second settlement in the <a href="American%20Bottom">American Bottom</a> in 1805, at which time the area was yet part of <a href="Johnson%20County%2C%20Illinois">Johnson County</a>. Hills in the area attracted some settlement in 1811 by refugees from the <a href="1811%E2%80%9312%20New%20Madrid%20earthquakes">New Madrid Earthquake</a> seeking stable ground, but even at the end of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, the white man was much less numerous than the red in this part of the <a href="Illinois%20Territory">Illinois Territory</a>. Union County was formed by a law of January 1818, which specified the location at which the county officials should meet before selecting a county seat. Just two months later, the officials accepted the donation of land at the present site of Jonesboro, and a rude log courthouse was quickly erected by one Thomas Cox. Although the frontiersmen advocated for such a simple building, holding that justice could be dispensed equally in primitive buildings and grand, a <a href="framing%20%28construction%29">frame</a> courthouse was built in 1820 to replace the original.

Jonesboro and Anna.
Jonesboro flourished into the 1850s, but the construction of the <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Railroad">Illinois Central Railroad</a> posed a new challenge: the company's engineers requested a <a href="plat%20map">plat map</a> of the community, but none being furnished, they bypassed the county seat by a mile, and the new community of <a href="Anna%2C%20Illinois">Anna</a> was established between Jonesboro and the railroad line. Improved transportation caused Anna to prosper, and it began to challenge Jonesboro for prominence in Union County. After an unsuccessful attempt to provide for a county-seat vote in 1868 via the state legislature, Anna partisans petitioned the county court for redress in 1870, but their petition was rejected, and the challenge gradually subsided.

Architectural history.
By the mid-1830s, the frame courthouse of 1820 had become insufficient, and the county government ordered its removal and the construction of a brick replacement on the same lot; the project was completed in 1838 at a cost of $5,000. Although the building was quite fine for the period, it was left altogether umaintained, and the necessity of constructing a fourth courthouse began to appear before the eyes of the county officials. The General Assembly passed an act in early 1853 permitting Union County to borrow $5,000 for construction (not many years after a similar act had permitted the county to borrow $1,000 to repair the previous building), and the replacement building opened in 1858 at a final cost of $12,000. Two <a href="storey">stories</a> tall with a taller central section, the building featured a small tower atop the stepped facade. In 1963, the county expanded the building by adding a two-story stone section to each side. Despite these additions, the county outgrew the building within half a century, forcing some departments to use offices in other buildings, and more than $10 million in bonds was issued in 2012 to enable the construction of a replacement and the demolition of the old building. Its architects were the <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a> office of <a href="HOK%20%28firm%29">HOK</a>. The replacement opened in August 2013.

Hendrick van Hoven

Hendrick van Hoven (died 1699, also named Hendrygo van Goven, alias Hind, Hine, Hynd, or Hynde) was a <a href="Dutch%20people">Dutch</a> <a href="buccaneer">buccaneer</a> and pirate active in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. He was known as “the grand pirate of the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>.”

History.
van Hoven had been first mate aboard the ship "Fortune", seized for piracy in 1698. All records of Hendrick van Hoven’s own piracy take place in 1699, beginning in March when he used his <a href="brigantine">brigantine</a> to take a <a href="sloop">sloop</a>. Another sloop captain reported a pirate robbing several ships near <a href="Tortuga%20%28Haiti%29">Tortuga</a> in April; this was probably van Hoven, as over the next month he was identified as robbing 18 more ships in the same area. With a wife and children in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, he was often cited as “Hine of New York”; <a href="Richard%20Coote%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Bellomont">Governor Bellomont</a> of New York described him as “a bloody villain, has murthered several men, and will give no quarter, they say, to Spaniards that he takes.”

van Hoven captured the 22-gun ship "Providence" of pirate hunter <a href="William%20Rhett">William Rhett</a> (who would go on to capture <a href="Stede%20Bonnet">Stede Bonnet</a>) in April 1699; Rhett made “a very generous defence, but was outdone and taken by the said Pirate.” van Hoven’s crew was a mix of Dutch, French, English, and other sailors; the English under <a href="John%20James%20%28pirate%29">John James</a> (who may have been with van Hoven since 1697) staged a mutiny, seizing the "Providence" and marooning van Hoven with several others a few miles from <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>. James sailed north, and some reports of his activities mistakenly placed van Hoven still in command of the "Providence" until word got out of James’ identity.

Captured by <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> Governor Read Elding, van Hoven was put on trial in October 1699 with several of his crewmates; some of his men had been executed the previous month. He protested that he had only taken Spanish ships and quoted the Biblical trials of King David and Hezekiah before petitioning for a reprieve: “if it cannot be fifteen days, let it be ten; if it cannot be ten, let it be five … to help me save that dear jewel my soul.” His reprieve was denied and he was hung in Nassau. Former members of his crew threatened Elding, promising to avenge their Captain. Reportedly van Hoven mumbled about hidden treasure in the southern Bahamas before dying.

Tragedy of enclosures

The concept of a "tragedy of enclosures" is attributable to Reid et al. (2014) who defined the concept in a scientific publication titled "Dynamics and Resilience of <a href="Rangeland">Rangeland</a>s and <a href="Pastoralism">Pastoral</a> Peoples Around the Globe." In the article, the authors describe the "tragedy of <a href="enclosure">enclosure</a>s" as "when common lands become <a href="Private%20land%20ownership">privatized</a> and fragmented by boundaries, such as fencing." The authors state that "settlement of <a href="Nomadic%20pastoralism">nomadic pastoralists</a> and <a href="Intensive%20animal%20farming">intensification of livestock production</a> were promoted in the past to exert political control over <a href="Nomadic%20pastoralism">mobile populations</a>, collect taxes, provide health and education services, and increase productivity." Additionally, the authors wrote that "comparing livestock weights on commercial ranches and pastoral common lands gave the impression that commercial ranches are more productive. But the opposite is true because high labor inputs and opportunistic grazing over large landscapes gives common land pastoralists the edge in production per unit area over commercial enterprises." The overarching concept of a "tragedy of enclosures" is similar to Hardin's "<a href="Tragedy%20of%20the%20commons">Tragedy of the Commons</a>" (which Reid et al. believe would be more aptly named "The Tragedy of <a href="Open%20access%20land">Open Access</a>") except rather than land degradation occurring by mismanagement on common land, it is the product of mismanagement and a resulting consequence of land fragmentation.

<doc id="54739044" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54739044" title="Little Red Lie">
Little Red Lie

Little Red Lie is an <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> developed by Will O'Neill, and released on July 7, 2017 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> and <a href="MacOS">Mac OS X</a> on the <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> platform.

It received positive reception from critics due to its exploration of the nature of modern poverty.

Gameplay.
"Little Red Lie" plays in the manner of a 2D, top-down RPG, although the game's sole means of interaction is to lie to others. Through knowing the best times to lie, players can "reshape" the lives of the characters they are playing as. These two characters are a middle-class woman struggling to get by, and a happy, rich and powerful man looking to accumulate even more wealth.

Plot.
The game revolves around the systems perpetuating the "feeling of hopelessness" in modern life, as well as <a href="economic%20inequality">economic inequality</a>. One of the two main characters, Sarah, is a <a href="Millennials">Millennial</a> girl who believed that her job prospects would be secure upon graduating from college, but was instead forced to live with her parents while contending with "stagnant wages" and "insecure employment". The second protagonist is Arthur Fox, a wealthy, charismatic <a href="Baby%20boomers">Baby Boomer</a>, financial guru, and motivational speaker, who lies in order to make even more money, and was inspired in part by <a href="Rob%20Ford">Rob Ford</a> and <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>.

Development.
The developer of the game, Will O'Neill, also developed "Actual Sunlight", an "unflinching" exploration of <a href="Depression%20%28differential%20diagnoses%29">depression</a>. He is a fan of narrative interactive storytelling, and set the game in <a href="Scarborough%2C%20Toronto">Scarborough</a>, his hometown. He stated that he developed the game out of passion and that it was unlikely to pay his bills, due to a "broken" system for <a href="indie%20game">indie game</a>s that made it difficult for them to stand out. He also stated that there was no community for "realistic, contemporary dramatic fiction", making the game even harder to market.

O'Neill believes that most Millennials do their best to hide the modern realities of income inequality, such as being forced to live with their parents. He believes that Millennials make "less and less money every year", and people must "face" this "rock-bottom social and political reality" in order to prevent "the richest and the worst" from taking advantage of them. However, the game is <a href="Nihilism">nihilistic</a>, and ultimately accepts that Americans will not make as much money as they did in the 20th century.

Reception.
The game was well received by critics. Jess Joho of <a href="Mashable">Mashable</a> called it an "important" vision that "couldn't have more relevance" to the middle class who is affected by financial inequality. Joe Donnelly of <a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a> called it a "brilliantly thoughtful adventure" and praised it as "stellar".

Capri Gourmet

Retecapri is a national television channel, broadcasting entertainment and information programs, and teleshopping. The channel belongs to <a href="Mediaset">Mediaset</a>.

History.
The channel was founded at the end of 1982. TBS had decided to create a second television network shortly after the arrival of the flagship broadcaster Telecapri in the network of <a href="Italia%201">Italia 1</a>: in fact it was thought to dedicate Telecapri to retransmission of the national schedule, and Retecapri their own productions, allowing them to preserve and continue to develop content created independently in Capri.

Until 1985, Retecapri offered quality programs, Some TV shows such as Peyton Place, The Strange Couple, The Addams Family, Get Smart, Laverne & Shirley; The famous Cinque Punto Zero block led by Uffi and Teresa Iaccarino, featuring a number of <a href="anime">anime</a>.

But in the mid-1980s, when Telecapri left Italia 1 and went to Euro TV (which, unlike the previous circuit, left the local networks wide spaces of autonomy), the majority of the activities and acquisitions of TBS poured back into the flagship network, leaving Retecapri deprived of the majority of programming, and began looking for its own identity.

From the end of 1985 to September 1987, the brand "Retecapri" was joined by "Music & Cinema"; In fact, programming was, in this period, mainly focused on music videes, alternating with films: these are the years of expansion that brings the caprese TV, already visible in the center-south of Italy, to become a national network.

In September 1987, the program went back to generalist until 1998, with films, telefilms, telenovels, anime, documentaries, teleshopping and since 1991 a very thick newscast by Teresa Iaccarino, with national services curated by the Roman offices of TBS and international services in collaboration with <a href="CNN">CNN</a>.

With the transition to digital, Retecapri was assigned the national LCN 20, comprised between local TVs and semigeneralist new-born channels: several times in its press releases the channel will protest against this decision and will ask the LCN 8 or 9, Arguing that neither <a href="MTV%20%28Italy">MTV</a> nor Deejay TV have the right to those positions, failing to meet the requirement of "analogue national generalist channel".

Retecapri proposed, in addition to the TG and information programs (such as Piazza Montecitorio, Pianeta Salute, New Magazine), <a href="The%20F.B.I.%20%28TV%20series%29">The F.B.I.</a>. and <a href="Finder%20of%20Lost%20Loves">Finder of Lost Loves</a>, the science fiction block "Film da un altro mondo", the film block "Un sogno in Bianco e Nero" at 9 pm and another movie at 22:30.

In April 2017, Television Broadcasting System sold Retecapri to Mediaset.

On May 5, 2017, the channel was added to the Mediaset 2 mux where it started broadcasting with Mediaset's ownership at 20:00 with Milagros. The programming is made up of Mediaset's library and soap operas.

After the sale of Retecapri, TBS transferred the programming to a new channel called Capri Television.

Gaius Popilius Carus Pedo

Gaius Popilius Carus Pedo was a <a href="Roman%20empire">Roman</a> <a href="Roman%20senate">senator</a> who held several offices in the emperor's service during the second century. He was <a href="suffect%20consul">suffect consul</a> in succession to <a href="Tiberius%20Licinius%20Cassius%20Cassianus">Tiberius Licinius Cassius Cassianus</a> as colleague of <a href="Sextus%20Cocceius%20Severianus%20Honorinus%20">Sextus Cocceius Severianus Honorinus </a> until the end of 147.

His cognomen has been interpreted as indicating that Carus Pedo originated in one of the Western provinces of the Empire, although some experts favor an Italian origin.

Life.
Pedo's "<a href="cursus%20honorum">cursus honorum</a>" is documented in an inscription from <a href="Tibur">Tibur</a>. He started his senatorial career likely in his teens as a member of the "decemviri stlitibus iudicandis", one of the four boards of the "<a href="vigintiviri">vigintiviri</a>", a minor "<a href="collegia">collegia</a>" young senators serve in at the start of their careers. Next he was a <a href="military%20tribune">military tribune</a> in <a href="Legio%20III%20Cyrenaica">Legio III Cyrenaica</a> around 132-135, which was stationed in <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">Syria</a> at the time; while holding this commission he received "<a href="dona%20militaria">dona militaria</a>" or military decorations. This was followed by holding in succession the traditional series of republican magistracies, all as candidate of the emperor: <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a>, <a href="plebeian%20tribune">plebeian tribune</a>, and at last <a href="praetor">praetor</a>. At this point Pedo was appointed <a href="legatus">legatus</a> or commander of <a href="Legio%20X%20Fretensis">Legio X Fretensis</a> around AD 141, but he rejected the post for unknown reasons. "There is a view that he did so because of bad health," writes Edward Dabrowa. Nevertheless, "the refusal did not affect his further career."

Carus Pedo held two civilian administrative posts prior to his consulship. The first was as curator of three important roads: the <a href="Via%20Aurelia">Via Aurelia</a>, both the older and new sections, the <a href="Via%20Cornelia">Via Cornelia</a> and the <a href="Via%20Triumphalis">Via Triumphalis</a>. His next post was prefect of the "<a href="aerarium%20Saturni">aerarium Saturni</a>", which Mirielle Corbier dates to 144-146. Following his consulship, Pedo was admitted to the "collegia" of the "<a href="epulones">septemviri epulonum</a>"; Dabrowa estimates this happened between the years 147 and 152. Also after his consulship Pedo was appointed curator of the "<a href="operum%20publicorum">operum publicorum</a>", one of the overseers of the public works of Rome; an inscription attests he was curator 19 September 150. Then he was appointed governor of <a href="Germania%20Superior">Germania Superior</a> from circa 151 to circa 155. Upon returning to Rome, Pedo was admitted to another priesthood, the "<a href="sodales%20Hadrianales">sodales Hadrianales</a>" circa 159/160. In 161/162 the <a href="sortition">sortition</a> allotted to Pedo <a href="Gallia%20Lugdunensis">Gallia Lugdunensis</a>, over which he was <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a>ar governor and <a href="censor">censor</a>, and upon returning to Rome the sortition immediately allotted to him <a href="Asia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Asia</a>, over which he was again proconsular governor 162/163.

His life after his governorship of Asia is unknown, as well as the date of his death.

Tome VI is an album by composer and bandleader <a href="Gil%20Mell%C3%A9">Gil Mellé</a> and the Jazz Electronauts recorded in 1968 and released on the <a href="Verve%20Records">Verve</a> label.

Reception.
The <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> review by Richard S. Ginell stated "After several years of experimentation, Melle came up with what he portentously called "the first album of electronic jazz." More to the point for jazz listeners, Melle revamped his quartet to keep up with the cutting edge of jazz, playing soprano sax and adopting several mannerisms of modal and free styles while reserving the electronic effects mostly for somewhat free interludes in between the jazz workouts. ... This LP was a technical breakthrough of sorts, for the electronic instruments were being played live at a time when electronic music could only be heard on pre-recorded tape. Aesthetically, it is merely a curiosity".

The term Somali lion ("Panthera leo") refers to a lion population in <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>.

Genetics and taxonomic history.
In 1939, the trinomen was considered <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a> with "<a href="Barbary%20lion">F. l. leo</a>".
<a href="Sir%20John%20Ellerman%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Ellerman</a> and <a href="Terence%20Morrison-Scott">Morrison-Scott</a> recognized only one lion subspecies in Africa, namely "P. l. leo".
Some authors considered the Somali lion also synonymous with "P. l. webbiensis", which was proposed for a lion specimen from <a href="Somaliland">Somaliland</a>. In 2005, the Somali lion was subordinated to "P. l. leo". <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> assessors also recognized "P. l. leo" as the only lion subspecies in Africa.

Results of a <a href="phylogeographic">phylogeographic</a> study indicate that <a href="Northeast%20Africa">Northeast Africa</a> is an <a href="Admixture%20%28genetics%29">admixture</a> region between <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>n and <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a>n lion populations.

HMS Madagascar (1841)

HMS "Madagascar" was a 19th-century <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a> in the service of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. The ship served as a troop transport during the <a href="First%20Opium%20War">First Opium War</a>, during which she was destroyed in an accidental fire.

History.
Madagascar was laid down by <a href="Blyth%20Shipbuilding%20Company">Blyth & Sons</a> as a wooden steamer of 951 tons in 1838. Early in her career she was owned by the London-based shipping company and was recorded to have made a trip to <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>. Following the decision of the British Parliament to send an expeditionary force to China, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> began to muster soldiers and ships for the upcoming war with the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>. In preparation for the China campaign, "Madagascar" was purchased by the British government as part of the Royal Navy's efforts to consolidate and strengthen it's forces in the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>. In the spring of 1840 "Madagascar" was ordered to <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, where the expedition was gathering. The steamer quickly departed Bengal and burned so much coal on her voyage to <a href="Penang">Penang</a> that her crew burned her yards and <a href="Sail">sail booms</a>.

During what would be known as the <a href="First%20Opium%20War">First Opium War</a>, "Madagascar" was deployed as part of the British military expedition to China. She was attached to the China Squadron, and served as a troop transport and supply ship. When the British fleet approached <a href="Peking">Peking</a> to negotiate with the Chinese government, the shallow-drafted (a feature that allowed the ship to cross sandbars in the shallow <a href="Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a>) "Madagascar" was used as a meeting site between British and Qing officials. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Canton%20%28May%201841%29">Second Battle of Canton</a> she departed China to make repairs in India. On her return trip to China In September 1841, she caught fire around 80 miles off the coast of the newly acquired British base at <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>. The <a href="lascar">lascar</a> and British crew evacuated the ship after it was discovered that the fire had spread to "Madagascar"'s coal stores, and the ship was later observed (from the lifeboats, at the time 10 miles away) to blow up when her ammunition detonated. The crew were captured by the Chinese, but were able to pass themselves off as <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="Old%20China%20Trade">merchants</a> and were later released at <a href="Macau">Macau</a>.

In 2005, the <a href="UNESCO%20Institute%20for%20Statistics">UNESCO Institute for Statistics</a> reported a literacy rate of 94.37% among the population aged 15 years and older. The literacy rate among the male population in this age group was 95.4% and 93.41% for female counterparts. Functional illiteracy among those aged 20 years or older (referring to when individuals have received no schooling or have not completed Grade 7 yet), was recorded at 15.4% in 2005 by <a href="Statistics%20South%20Africa">Statistics South Africa</a> (Stats SA). This has improved from the 27.3% of 2002.
According to the 2015 General Household Survey conducted by Statistics South Africa, women are more likely to be functionally illiterate across all age groups, apart from those aged between 20 and 39 years old.

The fair is now known as the South African Book Fair (SABF). The PASA decided to change the name in November 2013 ahead of the 2014 fair to encourage South Africans to take ownership of the event and make it more inclusive. The SABF became a public and trade fair in 2014 and is no owned by the South African Book Development Council (SABDC).

Franschhoek Literary Festival.
The first annual Franschhoek Literary Festival (FLF) took place in May 2007. The festival is hosted annually in the <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a>’s winelands in the town of <a href="Franschhoek">Franschhoek</a>, believed to be one of the oldest towns in South Africa. It has become internationally recognised for celebrating South African books and authors while fostering a culture of reading and writing among children. FLF also raises funds through the FLF School Library Fund to help encourage literacy in the community and develop school libraries in the Franschhoek Valley.
Since 2012, organisers of FLF started hosting the Book Week for Young Readers in the week preceding the main festival.

Co-hosted by <a href="Khanya%20College">Khanya College</a> and <a href="University%20of%20the%20Witwatersrand">Wits University</a> in <a href="Gauteng">Gauteng</a>, the Jozi Book Fair was launched in in 2009.

Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement

The Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA) is a proposed diplomatic arrangement that seeks to add to the existing free trade agreement between the <a href="India">Republic of India</a> and the <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Republic of Sri Lanka</a>, primarily in relation to trade-in services and the service sector; it seeks to emulate a <a href="Schengen%20Area">freedom-of-movement</a> system closer to the TN classification used by Canadian citizens to work in the USA.

The proposal is championed by supporters as a method to introduce low-cost goods for low-income people in Sri Lanka and increase sales of high-end goods to India, while also making Sri Lanka more attractive for FDI. But many lobby groups have become concerned that India would flood Sri Lanka with cheaper labor in a manner similar to the immigration problems surrounding <a href="Brexit">Brexit</a>. The high unemployment rate of India has been pointed out by many nationalist groups.

The proposed agreement's impact has been estimated to be an increase of $500 billion to the common economy. It has been likened to the economic union undertaken between the North-East Asian countries of Taiwan and People's Republic of China called the <a href="Economic%20Cooperation%20Framework%20Agreement">Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement</a>, and both agreements share issues with the island nation's people worrying about being undercut by cheaper laborers from the mainland.

Proposed Agreement.
Trade-In Services.
Sri Lanka has opened up its services market to workers in the fields of: computer, telecommunication, tourism, financial, health and maritime transport and auxiliary related services.

India has opened up its services to an array of professional services including engineering, urban planning, health etc., computer, telecommunication, research and development, real estate, recreational, cultural, educational, environmental, tourism, construction and transport related services.

Demographics.
The table below shows the demographics of an economic union between the Republic of India and Sri Lanka:

Reactions.
Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lankan prime minister: "These five southern states have a population of 250 million and a combined GDP of $450 billion. With an addition of Sri Lanka $80 billion, the GDP in this sub regional economy will cross $500 billion,"

Indian High Commissioner Y.K. Sinha: “They state a large number of Indians would come to Sri Lanka including barbers, lawyers and professors even and that they would take over Sri Lanka . . . These claims are amusing and completely untrue,”

Muhunthan Canagey –CEO of ICTA: "I would like to really know, do you really think the signing of ETCA will affect IT jobs in Sri Lanka? Are we Sri Lankans so inferior that we are so threatened to ensure doors are to be closed for IT professionals from India to come and join teams in Sri Lanka? Don’t you all think that in a world where software code is being developed all around the world and being delivered through the Internet, protecting IT professionals coming and working face to face with local teams is bad and will destroy us? Anyway, the work can be outsourced online."

GMOA member Dr. Haritha Aluthge: “We pointed out the kind of damage that will be posed to the Sri Lankan trade community. We were informed by the minister that they would finalize the ETCA only after reading the facts in the agreement and studying them,”

Members of the Young Lawyers Circle: “We also wish to tell the Government to stop signing this agreement which may have a disastrous impact on Sri Lanka’s labour force. According to available details, the Government has been compelled to sign this agreement secretly due to India’s urging. We demand that the government open an intellectual discussion on this agreement. As young lawyers, we demand that the government opens the agreement to the people and consult the professionals,”

Geethanjali Natraj, professor at the Indian Institute of Public Administration,“Given these states’ proximity to Sri Lanka, the ETCA would leverage Sri Lanka’s unique geo-strategic location, which is at the crossroads of major shipping routes. The ETCA would also increase regional integration and could make Sri Lanka the geo-economic centre of South Asia.”

Battle of Melantias

The Battle of Melantias or Battle of Melanthius, which took place on 559, was a battle between the armies of the <a href="Kutrigurs">Kutrigurs</a>, commanded by <a href="Zabergan">Zabergan</a>, and the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, under the command of general <a href="Belisarius">Belisarius</a>. In spite of its numerical inferiority, the Byzantine army won the battle and forced the Kutrigurs to withdraw. This was the last time Belisarius commanded a force in battle.

Background.
During the winter of 558, <a href="Zabergan">Zabergan</a> led a large Kutrigur army who crossed the frozen <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. This army invaded <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> and <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, threatening <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> itself. Terrified, Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> recalled <a href="Belisarius">Belisarius</a> from retirement. Belisarius led a small force of 300 veterans, together with locally raised levies, to drive the <a href="Kutrigurs">Kutrigurs</a> from the <a href="walls%20of%20Constantinople">walls of Constantinople</a>.

Battle.
Belisarius decided to meet the Kutrigurs and set up his camp a few kilometers from his opponent in <a href="Melantias">Melantias</a>, a settlement about 20 miles from Constantinople.

Zabergan wanted to take the Byzantines by surprise and left his camp with 2,000 horsemen, but he was in turn taken by surprise by Belisarius, who ambushed him. According to the Byzantine historian <a href="Agathias">Agathias</a>, Belisarius used a stratagem to make the Kutrigurs believe that they were facing a sizeable force. He asked local peasants to scatter in the forest and hit the trees to make a lot of dust in order to scare the horses of the Kutrigurs. The unit of Kutrigurs who approached the area panicked and many killed.

Aftermath.
Defeated, the Kutrigurs and their Slav allies retreated. They continued shortly to plunder Thrace before crossing the Danube and returning to their homeland.

Maui solar telescope protests

The Maui solar telescope protests are a series of protests and demonstrations attempting to block the construction of the <a href="Daniel%20K.%20Inouye%20Solar%20Telescope">Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope</a> on the summit of <a href="Haleakal%C4%81">Haleakalā</a> on <a href="Maui%2C%20Hawaii">Maui, Hawaii</a>. 

Background.
Beginning in 1958, telescopes began to be built atop Maui's Haleakalā summit becoming the <a href="Haleakala%20Observatory">Haleakalā High Altitude Observatory Site</a>, owned and managed by the <a href="University%20of%20Hawaii">University of Hawaii</a>. In 2010 the <a href="Hawai%27i%20Department%20of%20Land%20and%20Natural%20Resources">Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources</a> issued a permit for the construction, but that permit was revoked because it was granted before a required contested case hearing. Two hearings had to be held because the hearing officer of the first meeting was disqualified for ex parte communications with representatives of <a href="Daniel%20Inouye">Daniel Inouye</a>. The second meeting resulted in the new hearing officer recommending the permits. Groundbreaking took place in 2012. Construction was well underway even with a lawsuit to the Hawaii Supreme court. During an appeal of the second permit, one of the justices was concerned about the disconnect between an environmental impact study that showed a major impact, and the board's decision that there would be no substantial impact.

2015 protests.
In June of 2015 protesters blockaded the baseyard at the foot of the mountain that served as a staging area for construction. They succeeded in turning back the convoy delivery. They attempted the delivery again in late July.

In the early morning of July 31, 2015 activists, protesters and demonstrators showed up to block the Maui Baseyard. Aware that protesters were planning a demonstration, Maui police put out a statement saying: "Maui Police Department respects the rights for people to demonstrate peacefully," and, "We will respond in an appropriate manner." Protesters lay on the ground attached to PVC pipe and chains in an attempt to stop the construction of the telescope. Police arrested 20 people ranging in age from 19 to 60. One of those arrested was a Hawaiian Studies professor at the University of Hawaii, Maui, Kaleikoa Ka‘eo, who stated, "Fundamentally, we are asserting our human rights". Activist Trinette Furtado was not arrested but said, "We are not anti-telescope, we are not anti-science... We are for the mountain, we are for preserving our culture. We stand for the conservation, desecration, archaeological and Hawaiian access laws which protect Haleakala." Maui Police released the photos of 18 of the 20 arrested later that day.

On August 19, 2015 approximately 150 protesters attempted to block the convoy of construction trucks from its baseyard. Eight people were arrested when they refused to move from the roadway. Once past the first group of protesters, the convoy was again blocked at Haleakalā Crater road with debris scattered on the roadway. Police in full riot gear carried protesters away. Among those arrested was Joshua Lanakila Mangauil, a leader of the <a href="Thirty%20Meter%20Telescope%20protests">Thirty Meter Telescope protests</a>.

2016-2017.
In October of 2016 the Hawaii Supreme court upheld the BLNR permit.

On August 2, 2017, protesters attempted to block the equipment convoy containing the primary mirror for the telescope. Over 100 protesters had converged at the intersection of Kula Highway and Old Haleakalā Highway on the evening of August 1.

Summary.
Kenya had six entrants in the race, the three normally allowed including the number one runner in 2017 <a href="Celliphine%20Chepteek%20Chespol">Celliphine Chepteek Chespol</a>, plus defending champion <a href="Hyvin%20Jepkemoi">Hyvin Jepkemoi</a> and two ex-patriots; <a href="Winfred%20Mutile%20Yavi">Winfred Mutile Yavi</a> and world record holder / Olympic champion <a href="Ruth%20Jebet">Ruth Jebet</a> who were running for Bahrain. From the gun in the final <a href="Beatrice%20Chepkoech">Beatrice Chepkoech</a> went to the front. 

There is a partial lap at the beginning of all steeplechase events, that distance is variable depending on the construction of the steeplechase facilities at that track. The runners begin going over the barriers including the water jump when there are seven laps to go. 

After going over the first two barriers, Chepkoech continued to run the track instead of cutting off to the water with the leaders, mostly Kenyans and the two Bahraini runners starting to follow her. The others realized the mistake and ran through the water, Chepkoech ran past the water on the track then had to circle back to go over the water, dropping her well behind the field. Out of the chaos, Yavi took the lead with Chepkoech rushing to catch up. Later in the second lap, <a href="Purity%20Cherotich%20Kirui">Purity Cherotich Kirui</a> stumbled after a barrier with two other athletes falling over her body on the track, suddenly this caused a six woman breakaway. Jebet took over the lead and pushed the pace but hard running by Chepkoech managed to bridge the gap, while Yavi fell off the group shortly afterward. Jebet led Chespol, Jepkemoi, Chepkoech, plus Americans <a href="Emma%20Coburn">Emma Coburn</a> and <a href="Courtney%20Frerichs">Courtney Frerichs</a> tagging on the back through two more laps. 

On the backstretch with less than two laps to go, Coburn moved forward to challenge the Kenyans and Chespol dropped off the pace. At the bell, being challenged by Coburn and Chepkoech, Jebet began to drop back. Down the final backstretch it was four athletes shoulder to shoulder across the track, the Kenyans on the inside and the Americans on the outside. Out of that, Jepkemoi emerged in the lead with Frerichs on her outer shoulder and Coburn a step behind. After the hard comeback, Chepkoech faded. Entering the final water jump, Jepkemoi took the turn wide and smoothly with Frerichs following, but Coburn cut sharply and took the inside line through the water jump, emerging with a two metre lead over Frerichs who had a step on Jepkemoi. With free running room down the home stretch, Coburn opened up another seven metres on Frerichs who opened up another metre on Jepkemoi.

Coburn's 9:02.58 was a <a href="List%20of%20North%2C%20Central%20American%20and%20Caribbean%20records%20in%20athletics">Continental record</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20World%20Championships%20in%20Athletics%20records">Championship record</a> and improved her position to number six on the <a href="3000%20metres%20steeplechase%23Women">all time list</a>, one ahead of Frerichs.

Oxford to Cambridge Expressway

As part of the continued improvement of the Strategic Road Network, the UK government is considering creating the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway by linking existing roads and building new ones. This Expressway would be a motorway-standard road between Oxford and Cambridge, via Bedford and Milton Keynes. The case for its creation is examined in a Strategic Study, published in November 2016. The National Infrastructure Commission has sponsored a contest to encourage suggestions regarding urban space utilization along the proposed route. There are two groups who have expressed opposition to the project.

Background.
The government claims the Oxford to Cambridge corridor is one of the most significant growth areas in the country. Local authorities within the corridor are planning for substantial job and housing growth to support the continued economic development of the region. However, there is currently poor east-west connectivity, resulting in Oxford and Cambridge having better connections to London than each other.

Route and costs.
Three route options are currently being considered and are shown in outline form on page 39 of the Oxford to Cambridge Expressway Strategic Study: Stage 3 Report. In August 2017 a company was awarded a £15m contract to examine these options.

Early estimates of the cost of creating the expressway are in the region of £3 billion. 
Development of land adjacent to Expressway.
The <a href="National%20Infrastructure%20Commission">National Infrastructure Commission</a> launched a two-stage ideas contest in June 2017 in support of the project with the objective of encouraging a wide range of bodies to put forward suggestions about how the urban space alongside the route could be used. 

Criticism.
The <a href="Campaign%20to%20Protect%20Rural%20England">Campaign to Protect Rural England</a> has claimed that the favoured route that passes through the greenbelt is unnecessary and would encourage expansion of Oxford.

The <a href="Campaign%20for%20Better%20Transport%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Campaign for Better Transport (United Kingdom)</a> has reservations about Expressways in general.

Summary.
In the final, the early leader was Nigeria as <a href="Patience%20Okon%20George">Patience Okon George</a> made up the stagger on Botswana to her outside as they entered the far turn. <a href="Chrisann%20Gordon">Chrisann Gordon</a> pulled Jamaica close to Nigeria on the inside but lost some ground coming off the turn. Down the home stretch, George faded while <a href="Quanera%20Hayes">Quanera Hayes</a> brought USA into the lead at the handoff to <a href="Allyson%20Felix">Allyson Felix</a>. Felix ran a fast turn to put some separation on the field by the break. Further outside, Jamaica's <a href="Anneisha%20McLaughlin-Whilby">Anneisha McLaughlin-Whilby</a> was the next in contention until about 50 metres into her leg she McLaughlin-Whilby began to hop and lean back in pain. The entire field passed her as she tried to continue to the break line before collapsing to the track. Felix and USA had a 20 metre lead over the next best, Nigeria, a metre ahead of Great Britain. 

Felix continued to expand the lead. Down the homestretch, <a href="Laviai%20Nielsen">Laviai Nielsen</a> ran GBR past Nigeria's <a href="Abike%20Funmilola%20Egbeniyi">Abike Funmilola Egbeniyi</a>, but USA had already passed to <a href="Shakima%20Wimbley">Shakima Wimbley</a> almost four seconds before the other teams arrived. <a href="Iga%20Baumgart">Iga Baumgart</a> ran around the outside and after the handoff <a href="Aleksandra%20Gaworska">Aleksandra Gaworska</a>, Poland was behind GBR's <a href="Eilidh%20Doyle">Eilidh Doyle</a> breaking away from the other teams. 25 metres behind USA, Doyle opened up almost five metres on Gaworska but on the home stretch Doyle began to fade, Gaworska came back while Wimbley was speeding away.

Over five seconds later, GBR passed to <a href="Emily%20Diamond">Emily Diamond</a> slightly ahead of Poland's pass to <a href="Justyna%20%C5%9Awi%C4%99ty">Justyna Święty</a>. Francis continued to expand the lead.

Following a restructuring of this division it was sold to <a href="Mowag">Mowag</a> which is now responsible for support.

The Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 is very compact as it is designed to operate in the Swiss Air Force's <a href="aircraft%20cavern">aircraft cavern</a>s (or <a href="underground%20hangar">underground hangar</a>s). It runs on diesel fuel to lower the risk of fire. For precise maneuvering around the caverns, pilot tunnels and shelters it is equipped with special downward-shining floor lighting headlights to help the driver to follow floor markings.It is also used to provide a power supply to aircraft whitout an <a href="Auxiliary%20power%20unit">Auxiliary power unit</a>. It is used as well as tractors for about 1-4 engine start units or for ad hoc transport of mechanics and tools (e.g. spare wheel and jack by a flat tire of a landed aircraft). JuAir at <a href="D%C3%BCbendorf%20Air%20Base">Dübendorf Air Base</a> is the only civil user of this aircraft tug type. The aircraft tractors are equipped with four quick couplings as standard. This allows them to be loaded with a crane, in a short time, on every flatbed truck of the Swiss military. The Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 are street-legal, but with their 80km range and permitted maximum speed of 25 km/h, however, are not independently suitable for ad-hoc transfers. An ad-hoc capability was achieved with the 4 crane couplings. Such ad-hoc transfers were part of the concept of the Swiss Air Force in the Cold War. It was anticipated to use various <a href="Highway%20strip">motorway sections</a> of the <a href="Motorways%20of%20Switzerland">Motorways of Switzerland</a> as air force bases. This was also done several times in exercises. In these exercises the Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 was involved. For example, the "U TAUTO" exercise on March 24, 1982, the Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 were stationed at the <a href="Rest%20area">Rest area</a> "Windrose" near Münsingen.

Since both retirees were also on the Olympic podium, that left Olympic champion <a href="Nafissatou%20Thiam">Nafissatou Thiam</a> as the clear favorite. That position was emphasized when Ikauniece-Admidiņa was injured in the first event and could not continue. <a href="Yorgelis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Yorgelis Rodríguez</a> provided surprise competition when she made three personal bests in the high jump to stay only 8 points behind Thiam. Both Rodríguez and Thiam tied at 1.95 metres which equaled the World Championship Heptathlon Best. Home favorite <a href="Katarina%20Johnson-Thompson">Katarina Johnson-Thompson</a> was expected to be competitive, particularly in the high jump since she holds the British record, but she only made one clearance in the competition, at 1.80 metres, significantly below her personal best of 1.98 metres. Thiam separated from Rodríguez with a shot put 1.72 metres better. <a href="Carolin%20Sch%C3%A4fer">Carolin Schäfer</a> was the next closest challenger after her personal best in the shot. Thiam's normally weak 200 metres was consistent, 24.57 is only 0.17 seconds off her personal best but it opened the door for Schäfer to be the overall leader after day one. Johnson-Thompson's 22.78 roared her back into contention in fourth place.

At the beginning of the second day, Johnson-Thompson produced a 6.56 metre long jump to move up in the rankings. Rodríguez and Schäfer lost some ground with 6.23 metre and 6.20 metre jumps. On her final attempt, Thiam gained ground on all of them with her 6.57 metre best jump of the day. In the javelin throw, Thiam and Schäfer were about even through the first two throws, with Rodríguez losing about two metres to both of them and Johnson-Thompson falling well behind. On the final throw, Schäfer edged a few centimetres past Thiam's earlier throw, but Thiam unleashed a 53.93 metre throw to pad her lead by another 76 points. But the best javelin throw of the day was a World Championship Heptathlon Best 58.41 metres by Anouk Vetter, which brought her into the medal chase, displacing Rodríguez. Going into the final event, Vetter and Schäfer were virtually tied with only 3 points separation. They knew their performance in the 800 metres would determine which medal they got. With 170 points to spare, it would take a weak 800 metres by Thiam to allow either a shot at gold. Schäfer's 800 metres record was about 3 seconds faster than Vetter coming in, and needing her best Schäfer managed at 2:15.34 while Vetter visibly struggled to a 2:19.43. While Thiam's 800 metres was the third from the bottom, it was still adequate for an easy overall win.
