The Voice Kids of Vietnam (season 5)

The fifth season of "<a href="The%20Voice%20of%20Vietnam%23Kids%20Edition">The Voice Kids of Vietnam- Giọng hát Việt nhí</a>" began on 12 August 2017 on <a href="Vietnam%20Television">VTV3</a>. Vũ Cát Tường returned for her second season as a coach, while Noo Phước Thịnh, <a href="%C4%90%C3%B4ng%20Nhi">Đông Nhi</a> and Ông Cao Thắng were replaced by singers Soobin Hoàng Sơn, Hương Tràm ("<a href="The%20Voice%20of%20Vietnam%20%28season%201%29">The Voice season 1</a>" winner), and Tiên Cookie, respectively. This season marks the first time in the show's history to have a double chair composed of two female musicians.

Coaches and hosts.
The coaching panel had three changes from season four. After joining <a href="The%20Voice%20of%20Vietnam">the adult version</a> earlier in 2017, it was speculatd that both Noo Phước Thịnh and <a href="%C4%90%C3%B4ng%20Nhi">Đông Nhi</a> would not be returning to "The Voice Kids" for the fifth season. Continue with the success from the judging panel in 2016, young and famous Vietnamese singers were rumoured to be joining the show, which included Soobin Hoàng Sơn, Vietnamese hitmaker <a href="Son%20Tung%20M-TP">Sơn Tùng M-TP</a>, "<a href="The%20X%20Factor%20Vietnam">The X Factor Vietnam</a>" winner Giang Hồng Ngọc, Tiên Tiên, <a href="Minh%20H%E1%BA%B1ng">Minh Hằng</a> and "<a href="The%20Voice%20of%20Vietnam%20%28season%201%29">The Voice season 1</a>" winner Hương Tràm. On May 28, 2017, in an interview, Soobin Hoàng Sơn accidentally revealed that he would become a coach for The Voice Kids season 5, which he later confirmed the news. Vũ Cát Tường, a favorited coach from season 4, announced her return to the show on June 11. A poster was posted on the facebook fanpage of the show shortly afe\ter the first two coaches were announced, with shadows of the other two yet-to-be-announced coaches were blacked out. The poster arose rumors that Hương Tràm and musician Tiên Cookie would be new coaches. On June 26, 2017, the double chair was indeed revealed to be composed of Hương Tràm and Tiên Cookie. Different from the history of the show's double chair, which is usually composed of duos or couples, this is the first time that Hương Tràm and Tiên Cookie collaborate with each other.

Along with departures of Noo Phước Thịnh, <a href="%C4%90%C3%B4ng%20Nhi">Đông Nhi</a> and Ông Cao Thắng, is was also implied that host Ngô Kiến Huy, who is also a member of the group, would not returning to the show. Thành Trung, a popular TV presenter of Vietnamese television nowadays, was revealed to become the show's new host in the filming day. Quỳnh Chi, former host of the adult version, joined him in the Battles and Liveshows.

Each coach has the length of the contestant's performance to choose them for their team. If more than two coaches want the same contestant, the contestant will choose which team they want to join.

Dese Majoo Hartaal

Dese Majoo Hartaal, (Devanagari: देसय्‌ मजू हरताल) in the <a href="Newar%20language">Newar language</a> means the "Strike that never happened in the country", was kicked off in <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> the first of August.

(Internet strike) was a new concept in country like Nepal, and this is the first time in the history of Nepal that "Internet Strike" has taken place. This internet strike was somehow different than in other countries. The Internet Strike was done by the initiation of the Save Nepa Valley Movement.

The Internet Strike was called by Save Nepa valley Movement which was dedicated to work towards the betterment of Nepa Valley, the original term used for Kathmandu valley. The first call was made through a personal blog by a person named Rukshana Kapali, who was taking a leading role in the movement. The released information states the reason of calling the Internet Strike was a warning for authorities to take the voice of natives and locals seriously while making development in the valley.

The Rationale.
The Rationale for the Internet Strike was against deeply centralized development system and to push development and establishment of cities in other regions of Nepal. It was against destruction in the name of development and bringing construction projects without studying over all positive and negative impacts of it. The rationale was to emphasize development not just as construction work, but also looking for sustainability and positive human impacts. Deteriorating condition of existing urban and sub-urban premises was highlighted as the strike wanted authorities to focus on development of existing settlements, improving its quality and upbringing living standard and economic standard of the inhabitants, including everything from health facilitates, employment opportunities, water availability, proper road and sewage pipelines, traffic management. The movement emphasizes on introduction of Land Use Act and protection of fertile land while also focus on pollution rate of the valley. The movement also raised voice to control the un-managed new towns and new settlements created by Real Estates and Land Mafias that has caused the valley to sprawl and making it more and more messy, focus more on making cities in other regions of Nepal. It was also centralized to preserve, protect, promote and develop the ancient civilization of Nepa valley along heritage preservation including heritage towns of the valley and utilization of indigenous knowledge.
The construction of outer ringroad and satellite towns, as well as un-justified road expansions in the valley was opposed. The fast Track Project alignment was not agreed.

How it was done.
On August 1, people started changing their profiles into blackout and the officially released picture of the Movement. The hashtag #SaveNepaValley was used on twitter and Facebook. People started using the hashtag for August 1 and 2 and were successful to hit the top trend of Nepal. It was widespread on social media. On August 1, the hashtag was on the heat spot in Nepal, while top trending in Nepal. The first day got 9,300 tweets while the initiates decided to continue it to the second day as well. On August 2, it received 3,700 tweets. As the tweets and Facebook profile picture changing went viral, this brought attention to the national media as well as authority.

Aftermath.
Thousand of people showed up after the Dese majoo hartaal in <a href="Maitighar%20Mandala">Maitighar Mandala</a> of Kathmandu. The case which was filed in <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Nepal">Supreme court of Nepal</a> was postponed for the 20th time, again denying justice.

He studied art and architecture at the <a href="RMIT%20University">Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology</a> in Melbourne. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> he was recruited to the Australian Army, and after the war was stationed in occupied Japan as a staff member of a military newspaper, BCON, where he had a weekly column "In a mess by Mike". In 1945–46 he drew portraits of Japanese war criminals at the hearings of the <a href="International%20Military%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20Far%20East">International Military Tribunal for the Far East</a> in Tokyo. Back in Australia, he worked as a cartoonist for "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph%20%28Australia%29">The Sunday Telegraph</a>". 

In 1949 Ronnen emigrated to Israel and joined the staff of the daily newspaper, "The Palestine Post", which soon after accepted his proposal to change its title to <a href="The%20Jerusalem%20Post">The Jerusalem Post</a>.

Biotremology

Biotremology is the study of production, dispersion and reception of mechanical <a href="vibration">vibration</a>s by <a href="animal">animal</a>s, and their effect on <a href="animal%20behaviour">behaviour</a>. This involves <a href="neurophysiology">neurophysiological</a> and <a href="anatomy">anatomical</a> basis of vibration production and detection, and relation of vibrations to the medium they disperse through. Vibrations can represent either <a href="signal">signal</a>s used in <a href="Seismic%20communication">vibrational (seismic) communication</a> or inadvertent <a href="Sensory%20cue">cues</a> used, for example, in locating prey (in some cases even both). In almost all known cases, they are transmitted as <a href="surface%20wave">surface wave</a>s along the <a href="Interface%20%28matter%29">boundary</a> of a medium, i.e. <a href="Rayleigh%20wave">Rayleigh wave</a>s or bending waves.

Traditionally regarded part of <a href="bioacoustics">bioacoustics</a>, the discipline has recently begun to actively diverge on its own, because of the many peculiarities of the studied <a href="Stimulus%20modality">modality</a> compared with <a href="sound">sound</a>. Vibrational communication has been recognized as evolutionary older than sound and much more prevalent, at least among <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, although the two modalities are closely related and sometimes overlap. While many experimental approaches are shared between the two disciplines, scientists in the field of biotremology often use special equipment, such as <a href="laser%20vibrometer">laser vibrometer</a>s for detecting faint vibrational emissions by animals and electromagnetic transducers in contact with the substrate for artificial playback experiments.

People have observed vibrational communication by animals for hundreds of years, although the idea that vibrations may convey information dates to the middle of the 20th century. Swedish entomologist Frej Ossiannilsen pioneered the field in 1949 by suggesting vibrations transmitted through plants play a role in insect communication. His work demonstrating this suggestion was not heeded by contemporaries because many zoologists believed that such small animals are physically incapable of conveying information through solid substrates. Only with the advent of accessible <a href="signal%20processing">signal processing</a> technology decades later did the work by other pioneering individuals and groups, such as the Slovenian zoologist <a href="Matija%20Gogala">Matija Gogala</a>, establish the basis of biotremology. It remains a relatively understudied discipline, at least compared to bioacoustics, partly because most of animal-produced signals are undetectable to non-augmented human senses. Nevertheless, several instances of practical utilization of the knowledge obtained are already in use or are being actively developed, such as <a href="mating%20disruption">mating disruption</a> using vibrational noise for non-chemical <a href="pest%20control">pest control</a>.

Topostratigraphy () is a method of establishing stratigraphical units based on a mix of <a href="biostratigraphy">biostratigraphy</a> and <a href="lithostratigraphy">lithostratigraphy</a>. It is used localy in the <a href="Geology%20of%20the%20Baltic%20Sea">Baltic region</a> to study the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a>-aged <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>. In topostratgraphy the ages of units is defined with the aid of fossils and its extent is known from its rock type. The concept works better in Ordovician rocks in <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a> than in Sweden. This is because in Ordovician rock <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>s of Estonia changes in biostratigraphy are usually matched by changes in lithostratigraphy. In Sweden topostratigraphical units are mostly based on biostratigraphy as lithological variations are few, making topostratigraphy problematic as units are named after lithology.

Having been in use since the 1950s the term was introduced into Swedish in 1960 by Swedish-Estonian geologist <a href="Valdar%20Jaanusson">Valdar Jaanusson</a>. As of 2011 topostratigraphy was being replaced as method but had still some significance due to its historical usage.

The Fishing Museum

The Fishing Museum is a museum opened in 2002 and dedicated to the knowledge and dissemination of fishing and the maritime heritage of the <a href="Costa%20Brava">Costa Brava</a>. It's located in the area of the fishing port of <a href="Palam%C3%B3s">Palamós</a>, in the old port warehouse called "Tinglado". The permanent exhibition explains the history, the current affairs and the future of Costa Brava fishing in terms of sustainability.

The Fishing Museum is a municipal facility managed by the <a href="http%3A//fundaciopromediterrania.org/">Fundació Promediterrània</a>.

Origin.
The origin of the Fishing Museum starts in 1920, when the Cau de la Costa Brava was created in order to set up a new museum. In 1994, the City Council of Palamós signed an agreement with the University of Girona, which allowed to create a field of study and investigation to create the museum project. As a result of this collaboration, the project was redefined to turn it into a thematic museum dedicated to the fishing in the Costa Brava. In 1999, the project for the Inventory of Maritime and Fishing Heritage of the Costa Brava began, as part of the Ethnological Heritage Inventory of Catalonia. Another aim in the development of the project was the proposal to change the headquarters to one located in the fishing port, much more linked to the theme. In 1999 Ports of the <a href="Generalitat%20de%20Catalunya">Generalitat de Catalunya</a> ceded the 'Tinglado' building where nowadays is located the Fishing Museum.

Currently, the Fishing Museum is part of the Costa Brava Museums Network, the Network of Museums of Ethnology, the Network of Maritime Museums of the Catalan Coast, the Territorial Network of Museums of the Counties of Girona, the <a href="ICOM">ICOM</a> (International Council of Museums), the ICMM (International Council of Maritime Museums) and the AMMM (Association of Mediterranean Maritime Museums).

Mission and goals.
The main mission of the Fishing Museum is "contributing, as an element of quality, to the cultural, economic and social development of the community. It works to strengthen his own territory and to help about changes and reflections on the marine and fishing heritage that favor society.

Its objectives are to guarantee the conservation, protection and safeguarding of the collections of the Museum, to promote research on the maritime and fishery aspects and to contribute to raising awareness towards sustainability.

In this way, the Fishing Museum shows the history of the elemetal relationship between Man and the sea with an open, participatory and interpretative format, enabling visitors to feel part of a story that centres on fish and fishing, one which will leave them with a new way of viewing this ancient, seafaring trade. The museum is a place of dialogue between fishermen and society, ans aims to recover and preserve the ideas of an ancient tradition, while helping visitors to discover an exciting, yet fragile world.

The exhibition.
The permanent exhibition of the Fishing Museum is located in the Tinglado building, an old port warehouse built in the 1930s. The museum project was commissioned by the architects Dani Freixes, Eulàlia González and Artur Arias, and was awarded the National Design Award in 2001.


Services and facilities.
The Fishing Museum has different services and facilities to achieve its mission and goals. 

Espai del Peix (Gastronomic place).
The "Espai del Peix" is a cultural equipment located on the fish market at Palamós port that works as a gastronomic place. It contributes to the knowledge and sustainability of fishery products and their gastronomy, claiming and educating those unlisted species, but with a high culinary and gastronomic value. 

Les Barques del Peix (The fish' boats).
Floating extension of the Fishing Museum itself, consisting of the boats 'Gacela', the old fishing boat of dragging, and the "Polar Star", dedicated to fishing encircling.

Càtedra d'Estudis Marítims (Maritime Studies Chair).
It's part of the University of Girona in the territory and its objective is to become a platform for study, external projection and dissemination of the marine and fishing activity of the Girona coastline.

DOCUMARE.
Information and documentation service specialized in maritime and fishing issues. It adds and disseminates information and documentation with added value in order to promote research, knowledge, value and raise awareness of society towards activity, culture and maritime heritage.

Yomeishu Seizo Company, Limited

Yomeishu Seizo, Co., Ltd. (養命酒製造株式会社) is a pharmaceutical manufacturing company. Its headquarters are in <a href="Shibuya">Shibuya-ku</a>, <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. It manufactures and sells traditional medicated liquor called "Yomeishu" and is one of the <a href="List%20of%20oldest%20companies">oldest companies in the world</a>.


History of Yomeishu.
Yomeishu (養命酒) is a traditional Japanese medicinal <a href="liquor">liquor</a> an alcoholic beverage for medicinal uses and is found to be the oldest pharmaceutical product in Japan since <a href="1602">1602</a>.

According to the <a href="legend">legend</a> remaining in the manufacturer, Sokan Shiozawa, who was the village head of the <a href="Shinano%20Province">Shinshu</a> Ina-gun Ogusa area (now <a href="Nagano%20Prefecture">Nagano Prefecture</a> <a href="Kamiina%20District%2C%20Nagano">Kamiina-gun</a> <a href="Nakagawa%2C%20Nagano">Nakagawa village</a> Ogusa), rescued an old man who had fallen in the snow. After this episode, the old man became one of the <a href="Retainers%20in%20early%20China%20%28social%20group%29">retainer</a>s of Shiozawa family for three years. When he leaves Shiozawa family, he taught Sokan Shiozawa how to make medicinal sake in thanks for the rescue. This is the origin of Yomeishu. 

Production started in <a href="1602">1602</a> under the name "Yomeishu". In <a href="1603">1603</a>, it was presented to the <a href="shogun">shogun</a>, <a href="Tokugawa%20Ieyasu">Ieyasu Tokugawa</a>, and at that time Shiozawa was allowed to use the sign of "<a href="Flying%20Dragon%20%28Trademark%20of%20Yomeishu%29">Flying Dragon</a> (飛龍: <a href="Hiryu">Hiryu</a>)." It is said to be the first <a href="trademark">registered trademark</a> in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>.

There is a record that Ako Roshi (the main character of the story of <a href="Forty-seven%20r%C5%8Dnin">Forty-seven Ronin</a>, <a href="Ch%C5%ABshingura">Chūshingura</a>) was drinking Yomeishu. Also, Yomeishu has appeared in the novel published in <a href="1774">1774</a>, "Anecdote of Foreign Country Wasobyoje". It was manufactured at the Tenryu-kan of the Shiozawa clan for hundreds of years, and in <a href="1923">1923</a> Shiozawa family made a company organization.

Initially sold Yomeishu in earnest in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> in <a href="1930">1930</a> did not sell at all. From the alcoholic beverage dealers in Tokyo who tasted prior to entering, it was said that they were laughed at "what can be sold like this?" However, as a result of continuing steady advertising activities, sales in Tokyo in <a href="1963">1963</a>, 33 years later expanded to about 80 times of the first year of launch.

It became known outside of Japan that the Japanese <a href="General%20Board%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">navy general</a>, <a href="Isoroku%20Yamamoto">Isoroku Yamamoto</a>, loved Yomeishu and he brought some bottles of Yomeishu with him to join the <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval Treaty</a> with Ambassador <a href="Wakatsuki%20Reijir%C5%8D">Reijirō Wakatsuki</a>.

It also became popular as a nourishing tonic for a child with weak constitution for a while after <a href="World%20War%20II">world war II</a>. In addition to placing advertisements in <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a> <a href="Magazine">magazines</a> for boys and girls, there were also times when we sold them with car toys etc.

Oreet

The Oreet (pl. Ortinuek or Ortinweek) is a kinship group among the <a href="Nandi%20people">Nandi people</a> of <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> that is similar in concept to a clan. The members of an oreet were not necessarily related by blood as evidenced by the adoption of members of the Uasin Gishu <a href="Maasai%20people">Maasai</a> by Arap Sutek, the only Nandi smith at the time. His proteges would later be adopted into almost every other clan as smiths. More famously, the lineage of the Talai <a href="Orkoiyot">Orkoiik</a> were adopted members of the Segelai Maasai.

Membership and identification by Oreet traditionally served the purpose of regulating marriage (by prevent inbreeding since marriage within Oreet was largely not permitted), arbitrating in murder cases and a support system when payment of blood money was required. 
In modern Kenya, identification by oreet is declining among the Nandi and Kalenjin. However oreet histories have consequently gained prominence as a means of studying the settlement and formation of the Nandi sub-tribe of the Kalenjin. Like the wider Kalenjin <a href="Kalenjin%20people%23Occupation%20of%20the%20Rift%20Valley%20lands">Occupation of the Rift</a>, a look at the individual Nandi clan histories shows that the narrative of origin, though containing elements of truth, largely over simplifies the formation of the Nandi sub-tribe.

The Nandi sub-tribe was formed through the settlement of the Nandi region by members of various Kalenjin clans from different regions. The traditional Nandi account is that the first settlers in their country came from Elgon, and formed the Kipoiis clan; a name that possibly means 'the spirits'. They were led by a man named Kakipoch, founder of the Nandi section of the Kalenjin. They are said to have settled in the emet (county) of Aldai in south-western Nandi. Kakipoch's people were later joined by a few Kipsikis, who were then followed by people from the other Kalenjin branches.

The account of settlement by the 17 clans present in the early decade's of the 20th century is as follows;





The Nandi "ortinuek" are each identified by an 'animal' or tiondo, which no clan member could hunt. Clan symbols (tiondo) range from birds, wild animals, frog and snake to bees. Although the sun is not an animal, 'she' has oreet and is called 'tiondo' in the same sense as a lion.

Notable Oreet Customs.
It is claimed that Kong'ony (crested crane) was the first animal allocated a family. Hence Moi (Kong'ony) is regarded as the 'leader' and in child stories this is shown as the source of babies in a family.

The jackal (Kimageet, oreet of Tungo, korap oor) is claimed to have been the last tiondo to be allocated and comes along with several rules of favour (ostensibly to hide the fact that it was the last). Hence, even though the Nandi claim 'Cheptaab oreet age ne wendi oreet age' literally 'a daughter from one clan goes to another clan and belongs in the new clan', to mean a woman has no clan, the Tungo girls are permitted to retain their clan identity.

<doc id="54753489" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54753489" title="Lottery betting">
Lottery betting

Lottery betting is the activity of predicting the results of a lottery draw and placing a wager on the outcome. Lottery betting (also known as lotto betting) is a form of <a href="online%20gambling">online gambling</a>, run by licensed betting firms, where players place bets on the outcome of <a href="lottery">lottery</a> draws instead of buying physical or online  tickets via official lottery operators. 

By betting on the outcome of a lottery draw, rather than purchasing an official ticket, players are able to take part in <a href="Lotteries%20by%20country">international</a> and <a href="Lotteries%20in%20the%20United%20States">state</a> lottery draws that are usually out of their jurisdiction. For example, a resident of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> could place a bet on the outcome of the American lottery draw, <a href="Powerball">Powerball</a>, even though they would not be eligible to buy official tickets.

Lottery Betting Models.
Insurance-based

Most betting firms that provide lottery betting operate using an <a href="insurance">insurance</a>-backed model.

Companies using this model are not required to purchase tickets from official lottery operators[₃]. Instead, when a player places a wager on a lottery, the company then forwards this bet to a third-party insurance company. The betting company pays a set fee for every wager placed to the insurance company in order to offset the risk of a large lottery prize being won. If a player wins a large prize (such as a jackpot), the insurance company pays the betting company, who subsequently give the money to the winning player. In the event of small prize wins, the betting firm will typically pay the prize directly to the player from their own funds.

Insurance-backed lottery betting firms are required to hold betting licenses in the jurisdictions they wish to operate.

Ticket reseller

Companies operating using a ticket reseller model purchase tickets for the official lottery draw on behalf of the player. The company then charges the player the price of the ticket, as well as an extra commission. In the event of a winning ticket, the company collects the winnings from the official lottery operators and then forwards the winnings on to the player. 

Types of bets.
Draw betting

Betting on the outcome of lottery draws is the most common form of lottery betting. This follows the same format as purchasing online lottery tickets in that players follow the same ruleset as found on the official lottery draw. Typically, this means that players choose the same amount of numbers and win the same prizes if they match these numbers, as they would have if purchasing an official ticket. The cost of betting on a lottery can differ from the cost of purchasing an official lottery ticket.

Number betting

With some betting firms, players are also able to bet on certain numbers being drawn, rather than following the ruleset of official lottery operators. For example, a player could bet on just one number being drawn on a specific lottery. With number betting, the betting company can set its own prize amounts and pays out prizes directly to customers.

Legality.
Lottery betting is legal in parts of the world were online gambling is permitted, including most European nations, although it is heavily regulated. Companies offering lottery betting services are required by law to hold a relevant gambling license for the jurisdiction of their customers.

The Chronicles of the Warren Family

The Chronicles of the Warren Family are a series of short stories by Hungarian author <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Szandor%20Kellnar">Józef Szandor Kellnar</a>. The stories are mainly about the Warren family and their adventures. The plot spans from 1952-1956.

The family members are Theresa Warren (1898- ), Henry (1907- ), Debra (1908- ), Winston (1943- ), and Jesus (1947- ). Theresa, known as Aunt Terri and Henry are brother and sister and Debra, known as Debbie is Henry’s wife.

Henrich “Henry” Warren was born in 1907 in Nova Scotia, Canada to Joseph and Patricia Warren. Henry is believed to have also graduated from King George High School. Henry went to New York University and graduated in 1934 with a degree in History. In 1940, Henry married Debra von Hollenstamner in Pillow Peak. Henry has two children, Winston Alvin born in 1943, whilst Henry was away in Japan. The name Winston was derived from Debra’s father, Winston and Henry’s father, Joseph Alvin.

Cannes-Torcy cell

The "Cannes-Torcy cell" was a jihadist network in <a href="France">France</a> uncovered in 2012, then "considered the most dangerous to threaten the country."

Jewish grocery store attack.
Two members of the cell were first arrested after a grenade attack against a Jewish grocery store in <a href="Sarcelles">Sarcelles</a> in September 2012 that injured one person. Police later found bomb-making equipment in a storage unit rented by Jeremie Bailly, the alleged leader of the group. Another of the suspects, Muslim convert Jeremie Louis-Sidney, was killed in a police shootout on 6 October 2012 while resisting arrest. Three days after the shootout, police found "bags of potassium nitrate, sulfur, saltpeter, headlight bulbs and a pressure cooker" belonging to Louis-Sidney in an underground car park in <a href="Torcy">Torcy</a>, a suburb east of <a href="Paris">Paris</a>.

Two other alleged members of the cell, French-Algerian Ibrahim Boudina and French-Tunisian Abdelkader Tliba, were found to have set off for Syria just days after the attack. After first having joined the <a href="Al-Nusra%20Front">Al-Nusra Front</a>, they later joined the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> (ISIL). Having returned from Syria, Boudina was arrested on 11 February 2014 in <a href="Mandelieu-la-Napoule">Mandelieu-la-Napoule</a> near Cannes. Police thereafter found "a handgun, bomb-making instructions, and three soda cans filled with the high-explosive compound <a href="Acetone%20peroxide">TATP</a>" in a storage closet belonging to Boudina.

Trial.
Twenty members of the network were tried by a special anti-terror tribunal in Paris in 2017. Of the twenty, ten were in prison, seven on conditional release, and three others at large, with two thought to be in Syria. The cell was accused of plotting attacks against both military and civilian targets, and of seeking to join jihadists in Syria. During the trial, the cell was described as "the missing link" between Mohammed Merah, the perpetrator of the March 2012 <a href="Toulouse%20and%20Montauban%20shootings">Toulouse and Montauban shootings</a>, and the <a href="Brussels%20ISIL%20terror%20cell">Brussels ISIL terror cell</a> responsible for the <a href="November%202015%20Paris%20attacks">November 2015 Paris attacks</a>.

In June 2017, eighteen members of the cell were sentenced from one to 28 years in prison, while two were acquitted. The longest sentence was given to Jeremy Bailly, who was found guilty of throwing the grenade against the Jewish grocery store. Some others were convicted for assisting in the attack, while others were convicted for travelling to join jihadists in Syria. Among the latter was Ibrahim Boudina, who was also accused of "returning to commit an attack" on the <a href="Cote%20d%27Azur">Cote d'Azur</a>. Abdelkader Tliba was tried "in absentia", as he was still thought to be in Syria and to "have risen within the ranks of the Islamic State group."

Church of the Holy Cross, Kilgwrrwg

The Church of the Holy Cross, <a href="Kilgwrrwg">Kilgwrrwg</a>, <a href="Monmouthshire">Monmouthshire</a> is an early <a href="medieval">medieval</a> parish church that once supported a now abandoned village. A <a href="listed%20building">Grade II* listed building</a>, the church remains an active parish church.

History.
The writer <a href="Clive%20Aslet">Clive Aslet</a>, who describes the church as "the remotest (.) in Wales", recounts the legend of the founding of the church, on the spot where two <a href="yoke">yoke</a>d <a href="wikt%3Aheifer">heifer</a>s rested. The circular churchyard suggests a <a href="Celts">Celtic</a>, possibly <a href="Anno%20Domini">pre-Christian</a>, origin for the site. The present church is early medieval, <a href="Cadw">Cadw</a> suggesting a 13th century date. The existing features are from the 16th, 17th and 19th centuries. By the early 19th century, the church was described as little more than "a dilapidated <a href="sheepfold">sheepfold</a>". A restoration took place in 1820, at the instigation, and mostly at the expense, of a local schoolmaster, James Davies. More extensive rebuilding was undertaken by <a href="John%20Prichard">John Prichard</a> in 1871, and again in 1977-9 (Cadw) or 1989-90 (Newman). At the time of the 20th century reconstruction, the church was named Holy Cross, no earlier dedication being recorded.

Architecture and description.
The church is constructed of <a href="Old%20Red%20Sandstone">Old Red Sandstone</a>, the style a mix of <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Early English and Decorated</a>. It consists of a <a href="chancel">chancel</a>, <a href="nave">nave</a>, porch and <a href="bellcote">bellcote</a>. The interior is simple, the chancel having a plain <a href="truss">truss</a> rather than an arch. The church is Grade II* listed, the listing noting it as an "attractive and little altered medieval church from a now deserted village".

The churchyard contains an early cross, which is both a Grade II listed structure and a <a href="Scheduled%20monument">Scheduled monument</a>.

<doc id="54753655" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54753655" title="Ostreopsis">
Ostreopsis

Ostreopsidaceae is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of free-living <a href="dinoflagellate">dinoflagellate</a>s found in marine environments.

Taxonomy.
The taxonomy of this genus is problematic. When in 1901, Schmidt first created the genus "Ostreopsis", he described the <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type species</a> "<a href="Ostreopsis%20siamensis">O. siamensis</a>" from the <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> in the waters of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Siam">Gulf of Siam</a>. However, there were anomalies in the original drawing made by Schmidt, and "O. simensis" was redescribed by Fukuyo in 1981; at the same time, Fukuyo introduced two new species, "<a href="Ostreopsis%20lenticularis">O. lenticularis</a>" and "<a href="Ostreopsis%20ovata">O. ovata</a>".

Distribution and habitat.
"Ostreopsis" spp. have been found in many marine locations around the world. Despite "O. siamensis" having been found in the plankton, other species are generally found in <a href="benthic">benthic</a> habitats. They are most noticeable in temperate seas when they cause <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a>s in summer, an event that has become more frequent in the early part of the twenty-first century. The only species identified in the Mediterranean Sea are "O. ovata" and "O. siamensis". The bloom in 2006 off <a href="Sant%20Andreu%20de%20Llavaneres">Sant Andreu de Llavaneres</a> in northeastern Spain, was described as "a conspicuous, thick, brownish mucilage layer covering benthic macroalgae".

Toxicity.
Under certain conditions, dinoflagellates can become very numerous and cause algal blooms. These can lower the oxygen concentration of the water and can clog the gills of filter feeding organisms. Some of these dinoflagellates contain toxic chemicals which may be <a href="Pyrrolizidine%20alkaloid%20sequestration">sequestered</a> by animals that eat them, and can threaten public health and cause economic damage to <a href="Fishery">fisheries</a>.

Some species of "Ostreopsis" contain the <a href="Vasoconstriction">vasoconstrictor</a> <a href="palytoxin">palytoxin</a>, one of the most toxic, non-protein substances known. Palytoxin was first isolated from the <a href="zoanthid">zoanthid</a> "<a href="Palythoa%20toxica">Palythoa toxica</a>" and proved to be an unusually long chain polyether-type phytotoxin. It is now postulated that the substance is synthesized by the dinoflagellates and is subsequently incorporated into the zoanthid tissues; it may be a <a href="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> arrangement, and it is possible that bacteria are involved in the transfer. 

Species of "Ostreopsis" have been implicated in outbreaks of ill health in countries to the immediate north of the Mediterranean Sea, particularly Spain, Italy and Greece. Along the <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a>n coast of Italy, large numbers of people were affected after visiting beaches in the summer of 2005, and about 200 people sought medical help; symptoms included <a href="rhinorrhoea">rhinorrhoea</a>, <a href="fever">fever</a>, <a href="cough">cough</a> and mild breathing problems, and sometimes <a href="conjunctivitis">conjunctivitis</a>. These symptoms have been shown to be the result of <a href="aerosol">aerosol</a>s containing the dinoflagellates, which had been whipped off the surface of the water by winds, and carried ashore to the detriment of public health. In a separate incident, a mass mortality of the sea urchin "<a href="Evechinus%20chloroticus">Evechinus chloroticus</a>" occurred in New Zealand in 2004, associated with a bloom of "O. siamensis", although in this instance there were no human casualties.

All boys who were circumcised together are said to belong to the same "ibinda" or "ipinda". These age sets played a significant role in traditional Kalenjin society since they were used to record time. Once the young men of a particular "ibinda" came of age, they were tasked with protecting the tribal lands and the society, the period when they were in charge of protection of the society was known as the age of that "ibinda". There were eight ages in general though this varied between sections as an age-set would temporarily be dropped from use if a disastrous incident occurred during the age of the "ibinda".

Nandi.
Historically, the <a href="Nandi%20people">Nandi</a> had eight cyclical age-sets or "ibinwek", however they dropped one for a total of seven. Legend has it that the members of this ibinda were wiped out in war. For fear of a recurrence, the community decided to retire the age-set.

The order of Nandi "ibinwek" is roughly as given below. 


Age sub-set (siritiet).
In each age-set, the initiates were bundled into siritiet or what can be understood as a 'team'. There are four 'teams' or siritoik in an ibinda namely:

The <a href="symptom">symptom</a>s are a tender, localised lump in one <a href="breast">breast</a>, with redness in the skin over the lump.

St. John's Fortress, Šibenik

St. John's Fortress in <a href="%C5%A0ibenik">Šibenik</a> (also known as Tanaja, <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a>: Tvrđava sv. Ivana) is an <a href="early%20modern">early modern</a> fortress situated atop a hill north of the city's historical center. Named after a medieval church dedicated to <a href="St.%20John%20the%20Baptist">St. John the Baptist</a> that had stood there from at least 1444, the fortress, together with the adjacent Barone Fortress, was built during the War of Crete, and had successfully repelled consecutive <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> attacks in 1646 and 1647. A local name for the fortress, Tanaja, comes from one of its structures, a plier-shaped outwork – <a href="tenaille">tenaille</a> (Italian: tanaglia).
History.
At the beginning of the War of Crete, the city of Šibenik was in dire need of additional fortification objects. The citizens have been dreading the possibility of enemy attack from the hills above the city, and were pleading the <a href="Senate">Senate</a> for their fortification since the 1520s. In the spring of 1646, a <a href="Genovese">Genovese</a> engineer in <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian</a> service, fr. Antonio Leni, designed a simple symmetric fort with its front <a href="hornwork">hornwork</a> elongated towards the enemy and two flanking demi-bastions on the side towards the city. Again, the Venetian war council did not allocate funds for the construction, but they also did not forbid the citizens to build the fortress themselves. And so, according to Leni's plan, the development began. The groundwork was done on August 1st 1646 and the whole fortress was completed in just 58 days. Although built in haste and lacking certain elements, St. John's Fortress played a key role in city's defense against the Ottomans in October 1646 and especially during the month-long siege in August and September of 1647 when around 7,000 defenders managed to repel 25,000 Ottoman soldiers who have already conquered parts of the fortress. 

As the most modern, strongest and highest fortification, St. John’s Fortress assumed the central role of Šibenik defence. The basic form and structures of the fortress remained intact until today, as is witnessed by numerous graphic displays throughout the last three centuries. Venetian, <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n and <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslav</a> military forces have occupied the fortress, and left their mark in small-scale interventions on various facilities, depending on their needs. As the fortress was losing its primary function, the parts of the defense structures were more and more neglected, obsolete, and devastated by human factor. During the last few decades, the citizens of Šibenik used this area, already completely covered with <a href="Aleppo%20pine">Aleppo pine</a> forest, as a pathway and viewpoint.

Architecture.
First construction phase, realized in 1646, consisted in dry-stone star-shaped fort, built around the foundations of St. John's chapel. Many adaptations between 1646 and mid-1660’s resulted in a shape similar to today's. It is worth noting that the Fortress of St. John, during the time not even fully completed, in 1647 repulsed what was almost certainly the largest invading army in Dalmatia since the Roman times.

Revitalization project.
The Revitalization of St. John’s Fortress area project, worth €6.7M, is currently underway, with the fortress’ planned re-opening in September 2019.

Background.
This train is on the Ravana the demon king meditated hard, in order to invoke Lord Shiva. Shiva gave him one of the twelve Jyotirlingams to take back with him to Lanka, with the condition that if it were placed on the ground it would take root immediately. Varuna the God of water, entered Ravana's belly, and caused him to feel the need to relieve himself. Vishnu then came down in the form of a lad and volunteered to hold the Jyotirlingam as he relieved himself. But before Ravana could return, the young lad placed the Jyotirlingam on the ground to which it became rooted. A disappointed Ravana offered severe penances to Shiva here, and cut off nine of his heads as a part of his repentance. Shiva revived him and joined the heads to the body, like a Vaidya or a "physician", and hence, this Jyotirlingam goes by the name Vaidyanath.

Allergies in children

Allergies in children are those causes, pathophsiology, treatments, management, practices and control of allergies that develop in children. Up to 40 percent of children suffer from allergic rhinitis. And children are more likely to develop allergies if one or both parents have allergies. Allergies differ between adults and children. Part of the reason for this that the respiratory system in children is smaller. The bronchi and bronchioles are narrower so even a slight decrease in diameter of these airways can have serious consequences. In addition, children often 'outgrow' their allergies.

The incidence of childhood allergies has increased in the past 50 years.

Signs and symptoms.
The signs and symptoms of allergies in a child are:


Cause.
Each home contains possible <a href="allergen">allergen</a>s that can develop into allergies after exposure to:

Vitamin D deficiency at the time of birth and exposure to egg white, <a href="milk">milk</a>, <a href="peanut">peanut</a>, <a href="walnut">walnut</a>, <a href="soy">soy</a>, <a href="shrimp">shrimp</a>, <a href="cod%20fish">cod fish</a>, and <a href="wheat">wheat</a> makes a child more susceptible to allergies. <a href="Soy%20formula">Soy-based infant formula</a> is associated with allergies in infants.

Pathophysiology.
A child's allergy is an immune system reaction. The child is reacting to a specific substance, or allergen. The immune system of a child responds to the invading allergen by releasing <a href="histamine">histamine</a> and other chemicals that typically trigger symptoms in the nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, eyes, skin, or stomach lining. In some children, allergies can also trigger symptoms of asthma—a disease that causes wheezing or difficulty breathing. If a child has allergies and asthma, controlling the allergies is important because the lack of treatment may make the allergies worse. Compounds such as <a href="phthalates">phthalates</a> are associated with asthma in children. Asthma in children is associated with exposure to indoor allergens. in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction. Use of <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s in early life has been linked to the development of asthma. Exposure to indoor <a href="volatile%20organic%20compounds">volatile organic compounds</a> may be a trigger for asthma; <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> exposure, for example, has a positive association.

Diagnosis.
Testing is available to help identify any environmental or food allergies. Caregivers and clinicians can assess the child for the development of an <a href="allergy">allergy</a> by <a href="Health%20assessment">noting</a> the presence of signs and symptoms and history of exposure.

Prevention.
Avoiding allergens will help prevent symptoms. Allergies that a child has to the family pet can be controlled by removing the animal and finding it a new home. Exterminating cockroaches, mice and rats and a thorough cleaning can reduce symptoms of an allergy in children. <a href="Dust%20mites">Dust mites</a> are attracted to moisture. They consume <a href="human%20skin">human skin</a> that has come off and lodged in, furniture, rugs, mattresses, box springs, and pillows. The child's bedding can be covered with allergen-proof covers. Laundering of the child's clothing, bed linens and blankets will also reduce exposure.

Exposure to allergens outside the home can be controlled with the use of air conditioners. Washing the hair, taking a bath or shower before bedtime can be done to remove allergens that have been picked up from outside the home. If grass or grass pollen is an allergen it is sometimes beneficial to remain indoors while grass is being cut or mowed. Children with allergies to grass can avoid playing in the grass to prevent allergic symptoms. Staying out of piled leaves in the fall can help. Pets returning into the home after being outdoors may track in allergens.

Epidemiology.
Up to 5% of infants that are fed cow's milk-based formula will develop an allergy to cow's milk. Over half of cases in children in the United States occur in areas with air quality below EPA standards.

Legion of Light Troops

The Legion of Light Troops, also known as the Light Legion or Legion of Alorna was military unit in the <a href="Portuguese%20Army">Portuguese Army</a>, created in August 1796.

History.
After the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pyrenees">War of the Pyrenees</a>, the Portuguese Army created a new all-arms light corps under the command of - General <a href="Pedro%20de%20Almeida%2C%203rd%20Marquis%20de%20Alorna">Pedro de Almeida, 3rd Marquis de Alorna</a>. Entitled the Legion of Light Troops (Legiao de Tropas Ligeras), it consisted of a battalion of eight companies of infantry; three squadrons of cavalry, each having two companies; and a battery of <a href="horse%20artillery">horse artillery</a> armed with four six-pounders, having 56 men and 40 horses. The establishment totalled 1,339 men. Sometimes called the 'Experimental Legion', it was trained according to Alorna's adaptation of French tactical manuals. 
The experiment, however, remained isolated. The Legion was somewhat resented by the more conservative elements in the army, and was treated as a separate entity; the tactical novelties which it practised and which were being adopted in other armies - largely failed to spread to the rest of the army. Perhaps the only concession that might be ascribed to its avocation of light troops' tactics was the formation of a light infantry company in each infantry regiment. On 7 July 1803 the battery of artillery was incorporated into the Corte Artillery Regiment. The Legion was little affected by the 1806 regulations and remained a very distinct corps. In any event, the French soon marched in and the Legion of Light Troops was disbanded on 22 December 1807. The pro-French Alorna and some of his officers and men formed the <a href="Portuguese%20Legion">Portuguese Legion</a> in French pay.

Lê Khắc Xương

Prince Lê Khắc Xương (1440 - 1476), <a href="Vietnamese%20language">Vietnamese</a>: Cung vương Lê Khắc Xương(恭王黎克昌), was a Prince of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Dynasty">Lê Dynasty</a> in <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. He was the second prince of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%C3%A1i%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Thái Tông</a>, also elder brother of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Nh%C3%A2n%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Nhân Tông</a>, and <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%C3%A1nh%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Thánh Tông</a>.

Biography.
Born in 1440, as a son of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%C3%A1i%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Thái Tông</a> and Lady Bùi thị of <a href="%C4%90%E1%BA%ADu%20Li%C3%AAu">Đậu Liêu</a> Bùi clan. His maternal grandfather is <a href="B%C3%B9i%20C%E1%BA%A7m%20H%E1%BB%95">Bùi Cầm Hổ</a>, one official in era of <a href="L%C3%AA%20L%E1%BB%A3i">Emperor Lê Thái Tổ</a>.

In <a href="Thi%C3%AAn%20H%C6%B0ng%20Coup">Thiên Hưng Coup</a> in 1460, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Nghi%20D%C3%A2n">Prince Lê Nghi Dân</a> killed <a href="L%C3%AA%20Nh%C3%A2n%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Nhân Tông</a> and then became the fourth emperor of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Dynasty">Lê Dynasty</a> with the name of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Nghi%20D%C3%A2n">Thiên Hưng Đế</a>, but after 8 months of his reign, he was disposed by a group of officials - notably <a href="L%C3%AA%20L%C4%83ng">Lê Lăng</a>, <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20X%C3%AD">Nguyễn Xí</a>, <a href="%C4%90inh%20Li%E1%BB%87t">Đinh Liệt</a>. Officials who launched the coup wanted to put Prince Lê Khắc Xương to the throne, but he refused. Therefore, the youngest Prince Lê Tư Thành became the next ruler, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%C3%A1nh%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Thánh Tông</a>.

However, during the early time of his reign, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%C3%A1nh%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Thánh Tông</a> started worry about his elder brother who should have been the real King, not him. He killed the official <a href="L%C3%AA%20L%C4%83ng">Lê Lăng</a>, one of main leaders of coup, and drove Prince Lê Khắc Xương to suicide. Prince Lê Khắc Xương died in 1476 in <a href="%C4%90%C3%B4ng%20Kinh">Đông Kinh</a>. His children were not allowed to keep the family name of Royal court as "Lê" and all were requested to change their clan name to "Bùi" of their grandmother.

Although woodblock printing on fabrics has been in India for centuries, the paper adaptation of woodblock printing appeared relatively late, because of the late entry and early exit due to advent of lithography the Battala woodcut printing had a remarkably short run. The Battala woodcuts were printed on a very cheap newsprint like paper to keep the cost of these prints low. Because of the short run, cheap paper and humid conditions of the region very few of these prints have survived.

History.
In the early 19th Century, the <a href="Battala">Battala</a> area became known for the prints, which typically had a religious or mystical theme. They made their first appearance in the 1820s as book illustrations; by the mid nineteenth century printmakers started printing the smaller prints, which often represented <a href="Kalighat">Kalighat</a> paintings.

Demand for the prints began to decline with the introduction of <a href="lithography">color lithography</a> printing.

House of Knesebeck

Knesebeck is the name of two branches of a prominent aristocratic family in the tradition of <a href="Uradel">ancient nobility</a> in Germany. In the 17th century they acknowledged a common ancestry and combined their arms. The "black" line of the family von dem Knesebeck stems from the ancient nobility of <a href="Lower%20Saxony">Lower Saxony</a>, while the "white" line stems from the ancient nobility of the <a href="Altmark">Altmark</a>. Branches of both lines remain to this day. The family has produced numerous senior military and public figures.

History.
Origin.
The castle of <a href="Knesebeck">Knesebeck</a> in Lower Saxony was jointly established by the first <a href="Duke%20of%20Brunswick">Duke of Brunswick</a>/Lüneburg and the <a href="Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg">Margrave of Brandenburg</a> in 1236, as a defence against the <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a>. Each appointed a knight to man it, who then both took their name from the castle, as was common at the time. The first documented mention in the black line is of a "Wasmodos von dem Knesebeck" in 1248. From 1374 the family held the position of hereditary <a href="Chamberlain%20%28office%29">chamberlain</a> of the <a href="Principality%20of%20L%C3%BCneburg">Principality of Lüneburg</a>. 

The first documented mention of the white line is of "Bodo de Soltwedele" in 1207. He was governor and constable in <a href="Salzwedel">Salzwedel</a>, from which he initially took his name. He is first mentioned as "de Knesebeke" on 26 January 1244 as a witness in a document for the Margraves <a href="John%20I%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg">Johann</a> and <a href="Otto%20III%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg">Otto of Brandenburg</a>. 

Rise.
In 1281 "Pariadmus miles dictus de Knesebecke" appears as donor of an altar to St Spiritus in the convent of <a href="Diesdorf">Diesdorf</a>, while the brothers "Boldewinus" and "Paridam de Knesebeck" are mentioned as selling the estate of Mackstorf to the convent of <a href="Dambeck">Dambeck</a> in 1283. In 1338 the family became vassals of Margrave <a href="Louis%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Louis I of Brandenburg</a>, in exchange for providing ten men in armour and forty armed with spears. In 1374 "Werner von dem Knesebeck" was awarded the position of chamberlain of the Principality of Lüneburg, which his grandfather hat first held, as a hereditary office.

Among notable members of the black line were Hempo von dem Knesebeck (1595–1656), diplomat and Master of the Horse to <a href="Christian%20I%2C%20Prince%20of%20Anhalt-Bernburg">Christian I. of Anhalt</a>; (1775-1842), <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hanover">Hanoverian</a> <a href="Major-General">Major-General</a>, and his sons Major-General Bernhard (1817-1887) and <a href="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</a> Ernst Julius Georg von dem Knesebeck (1809–1869). Bernhard von dem Knesebeck rose to prominence as a senior field commander during the <a href="Austro-Prussian%20War">Austro-Prussian War</a> (1866) and the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> (1871) and later as Commandant of <a href="Erfurt">Erfurt</a>; his brother Ernst Julius Georg von dem Knesebeck served on the <a href="general%20staff">general staff</a> and as ambassador to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Bavarian</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a> courts. His son Bodo von dem Knesebeck (1851-1911), rose to Imperial <a href="Chamberlain%20%28office%29">Chamberlain</a> and <a href="Master%20of%20Ceremonies">Master of Ceremonies</a>, Secretary of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Eagle">Order of the Black Eagle</a> and founder of the German <a href="Diplomatic%20Corps">Diplomatic Corps</a>. His other son Lionel von dem Knesebeck (1849-1916), served as <a href="Hofmarschall">Hofmarschall</a> to <a href="Prince%20Frederick%20Charles%20of%20Hesse">Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse</a>, the last <a href="King%20of%20Finland">King of Finland</a>.

Numerous members of the white line rose to senior positions in Brandenburgish and later Prussian military and public service. In 1440 Paridam von dem Knesebeck served as <a href="Prince-Bishop">Prince-Bishop</a> <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Ratzeburg">of Ratzeburg</a>, while in 1464 Matthias von dem Knesebeck became <a href="Prelate">Prelate</a> of the Benedictine <a href="Ebstorf%20Abbey">Ebstorf Abbey</a>, having previously served as secretary and chancellor to the Dukes of Brunswick. Ludolf von dem Knesebeck joined <a href="Vasco%20da%20Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> as a <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> on his exploration of the <a href="Portuguese%20discovery%20of%20the%20sea%20route%20to%20India">sea route to India</a> in 1497. Thomas von dem Knesebeck (1559–1625) rose to <a href="Landeshauptmann">Landeshauptmann</a> (Governor) of the Altmark and was instrumental in introducing the <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a> to Brandenburg.

Of particular note among the women of the family is Friedrike Wilhelmine von dem Knesebeck (1750-1802), daughter of the <a href="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> and <a href="Adjutant-General">Adjutant-General</a> Carl Christoph Johann von dem Knesebeck, who became <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a> to <a href="Sophia%20Dorothea%20of%20Hanover">Queen Sophia Dorothea</a> of Prussia. While riding in a carriage in Berlin her horses bolted, upon which she promptly jumped from the speeding vehicle. <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a> was so impressed by her courage that he penned a two page poem in French, describing her as “braver than <a href="Penthesilea">Penthesilea</a>”.

Latch (breastfeeding)

The latch refers to how the baby fastens onto the <a href="breast">breast</a> while breastfeeding. How the baby latches is more important than how the baby is held during nursing. A good latch means that the bottom of the <a href="areola">areola</a> (the area around the <a href="nipple">nipple</a>) is in the baby's mouth and the nipple is back inside his or her mouth, where it's soft and flexible. A shallow, or poor, latch happens when the baby does not have enough of the breast in his/her mouth or is too close to the tip. A shallow latch causes the sensitive nipple skin to press against the bones in the top of the baby's mouth. That can cause the the development of <a href="cracked%20nipple">cracked nipple</a>s. The nipples are sore, and bleed.

Positioning.
Assuming a comfortable position helps the baby to latch properly. It takes practice to get a good latch. The best nursing hold that works best for mother and baby is sometimes discovered through trial and error.

Getting a good latch for breasting can be learned. Recommendations for nursing mothers is to:

Latching on is facilitated by secretions from the nipple that are reported to help align the infants' head with the mother's breast and thought to promote latching and sucking.

Pain.
Pain is a good indication of a poor latch. If the pain lasts longer than a few seconds, the latch is probably too shallow. The technique for getting a good latch is to gently break the suction by placing a clean finger into the baby's baby's mouth and help the baby latch on again. When the baby unlatches the nipple should the same or slightly longer. Pain or pinching is a sign of a poor latch.

When the baby latches it can feel like a pinch that goes away. If it's more painful than that, it's probably a bad latch. And if the latch hurts the mom, it also keeps the baby from getting enough milk.
Tongue-tied.
Sometimes, a baby's tongue is stuck to the bottom of the mouth by a band of tissue, which means the baby can't open his or her mouth wide enough to get a good latch. Checking for tongue-tie isn't a standard newborn test. If the baby isn't latching on well and doesn't seem to be gaining weight mothers are advised to contact the pediatrician or nurse to ask about this. Fortunately, it's a very simple fix. Once tongue-tie is treated by a medical professional, breastfeeding improves.

Infants will naturally move their head while looking and feeling for a breast to feed. There are many ways to start feeding the infant, and the best approach is the one that works for the mother and the infant. The steps below can help with getting the infant to "latch" on to the breast for feeding.2

Hold the infant against a bare chest. Dress the infant in only a diaper to ensure skin-to-skin contact.
Keep the infant upright, with his or her head directly under the chin.
Support the infant's neck and shoulders with one hand and his or her hips with the other hand. The infant may try to move around to find the breast.
The infant's head should be slightly tilted back to make nursing and swallowing easier. When his or her head is tilted back and the mouth is open, the tongue will naturally be down in the mouth to allow the breast to go on top of it.
At first, allow the breast to hang naturally. The infant may open his or her mouth when the nipple is near his or her mouth. The mother also can gently guide the infant to latch on to the nipple.
While the infant is feeding, his or her nostrils may flare to breathe in air. Do not panic—this flaring is normal. The infant can breathe normally while breastfeeding.
As the infant tilts backward, support his or her upper back and shoulders with the palm of the hand and gently pull the infant close.

Signs of a good latch.
A good latch is important for both effective breastfeeding and comfort. Review the following signs to determine whether the infant has a good latch:


Poor latching.
Not only is a poor latch painful but it can also lead to <a href="blocked%20milk%20duct">blocked milk duct</a>s, <a href="mastitis">mastitis</a>, and other <a href="infection">infection</a>s. A poor latch also isn't good for the baby, as it means he or she isn't getting enough milk. So if poor latching has been occuring for more than a few days breastfeeding mothers can get help. There are resources available at no or low cost.

Sumikko Gurashi

Sumikko Gurashi (すみっコぐらし "Sumikko Gurashi") is a set of <a href="Character%20%28Arts%29">fictional characters</a> produced by the Japanese company <a href="San-X">San-X</a>. Its name roughly translates to “Life in the Corner”. The characters were first designed and released in September 2012 by Yuri Yokomizo, a graphic designer working for San-X. Its main inspiration was the feeling of comfort when one is near a corner, and it is based on Yokomizo's notebook doodles when she was a student. A wealth of merchandise, such as stationery, stuffed animals, and clothing, is sold.

It is also promoted in Taiwan, and is known as "Jiǎoluò Xiǎohuǒbàn" (角落小夥伴, lit. “Little Corner Partners”) or "Jiǎoluò shēngwù" (角落生物, lit. “Corner Creatures”) in Chinese.

Setting.
Targeting Japanese people with an affinity to “corners”, such as the corner seat of a café or the corner of a room, the characters are <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphosed</a> from animals and food items.

The characters are split mainly into “Sumikko”, the main characters, and “Minikko”, the smaller side characters. Most characters have common traits: they have a negative personality, they are castaways in everyday life, and they feel the most relaxed when they are near a corner. Currently, the main Sumikko are Shirokuma (Polar Bear), Penguin?, Neko (Cat), Tonkatsu (Pork Cutlet), and Tokage (Lizard).




Merchandise.
Merchandise depicting the Sumikko Gurashi characters include stationery, stuffed dolls, pouches, and silverware. There are also seasonal designed items, depicting Sumikko wearing hats and mufflers in the winter, or depicting them at a beach holding watermelons in the summer.

On October 2014, the Sumikko Gurashi Fan Book, the official <a href="Mook%20%28publishing%29">mook</a> with enclosed items, was released. Since then, there have been five more books, as well as four <a href="Nintendo%203DS">3DS</a> games and one <a href="mobile%20app">mobile app</a>.

Rampa Rebellion of 1922

The Rampa Rebellion of 1922 was a <a href="tribes%20of%20India">tribal</a> uprising, led by <a href="Alluri%20Sitarama%20Raju">Alluri Sitarama Raju</a> in <a href="Godavari%20Agency">Godavari Agency</a> of <a href="Madras%20Presidency">Madras Presidency</a>, <a href="British%20India">British India</a>. It began in August of 1922 and lasted until the capture and killing of Raju in May 1924.

The Rampa administrative area, situated in the hills of what are now the Godavari districts of <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, comprised around and had a mostly tribal population of approximately 28,000. They had traditionally been able to support their food requirements through the use, in particular, of the <a href="podu">podu</a> system whereby each year some areas of jungle forest were <a href="shifting%20cultivation">burned to clear land for cultivation</a>. 

The <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> authorities had wanted to improve the economic usefulness of lands in Godavari Agency, an area that was noted for the prevalence of <a href="malaria">malaria</a> and <a href="blackwater%20fever">blackwater fever</a>. The traditional cultivation methods were greatly hindered when the authorities took control of the forests, mostly for commercial purposes such as produce for building railways and ships, without any regard for the needs of the tribal people. A 1923 government memorandum recorded one Agency Commissioner's opinion from June of the previous year that "the country had suffered from too severe restrictions on jungle clearance, that various restrictions had been overdone and much population and food grains lost for the sake of forests of doubtful value".

The tribal people had long felt that the legal system favoured <a href="zamindar">zamindar</a>s (estate landowners) and merchants, which had also resulted in the earlier <a href="Rampa%20Rebellion%20of%201879">Rampa Rebellion of 1879</a>. Now they objected to the Raj laws and continued actions that hindered their economic position and meant they had to find alternate means of livelihood, such as working as <a href="coolie">coolie</a>s. In particular, they objected to attempts at that time to use them as forced labour in the construction of a road in the area.

It was the prevalent diseases, to which the tribal people had acquired a tolerance, that hindered the Raj suppression of the rebellion. It broke out in August 1922 and took the form of <a href="guerilla%20warfare">guerilla warfare</a>, ending in May 1924 with the capture and shooting of Raju.

After arriving in India with 78 officers and 1,522 enlisted men on 26 August, the regiment was transported by rail to <a href="Ramgarh%2C%20Bihar">Ramgarh Training Center</a>, where it conducted infantry, jungle, patrol, and long range penetration training. It was reorganized as the 124th Cavalry, Special on 20 September after being officially dismounted. Five days later, the 3rd Squadron was activated in India from other regimental personnel after being reconstituted on 20 September. The regiment became part of the newly activated 5332nd Brigade (Provisional), which became the <a href="Mars%20Task%20Force">Mars Task Force</a>.

In October, the regiment was flown to <a href="Myitkyina">Myitkyina</a>, entering combat with the task force. The regiment moved into the mountains of northern Burma on 15 December, and in subsequent months fought in numerous pitched battles with Japanese troops in and around the <a href="Burma%20Road">Burma Road</a>. The 124th conducted long range operations deep behind Japanese lines, and used pack mules and aerial resupply. The 124th built roadblocks along the Burma Road during the campaign to wrest the road from Japanese control below <a href="Nankam">Nankam</a>. To block the road at <a href="Nampakka">Nampakka</a>, it moved over 300 miles in Japanese-held territory, relying only on aerial resupply. On 15 January 1945, the regiment met in battle with Japanese forces. Troop F commander <a href="1st%20Lieutenant">1st Lieutenant</a> <a href="Jack%20L.%20Knight">Jack L.

Jia Kui (30-101)

Jia Kui (, 30–101 CE), <a href="courtesy%20name">courtesy name</a> Jingbo, was a <a href="Confucian">Confucian</a> philosopher who lived in the early <a href="Eastern%20Han">Eastern Han</a> period. He was a descendant of the <a href="Western%20Han">Western Han</a> politician and writer <a href="Jia%20Yi">Jia Yi</a>.. He was born in was Pingling (平陵), Youfufeng <a href="Commandery%20%28China%29">Commandery</a> (右扶風郡), which is located northeast of present-day <a href="Xingping">Xingping</a>, <a href="Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a>.. He studied at university in <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>.

Like his father, Jia Hui, he was an expert in the "<a href="Zuo%20Zhuan">Zuo Zhuan</a>" and the "<a href="Guoyu%20%28book%29">Guoyu</a>", presenting his commentary on these to <a href="Emperor%20Ming%20of%20Han">Emperor Ming</a> in around 67 CE, who added them to the imperial collection. He was a colleague of <a href="Ban%20Gu">Ban Gu</a> at the imperial library, and like him, wrote a commentary on <a href="Qu%20Yuan">Qu Yuan</a>'s poem "<a href="Li%20Sao">Li Sao</a>".

Upon <a href="Emperor%20Zhang%20of%20Han">Emperor Zhang</a>'s ascension to the throne, he ordered Jia to write of the "<a href="Zuo%20Zhuan">Zuo Zhuan</a>"'s superiority to both the "<a href="Guliang%20Zhuan">Guliang Zhuan</a>" and the "<a href="Gongyang%20Zhuan">Gongyang Zhuan</a>". Jia produced the work, arguing that only "Zuo Zhuan" agreed with the supposedly-prophetic <a href="chen%20prophecy">"chen"</a>, proclaiming that the House of Liu (the Han dynastic family) was destined to rule as successors of the legendary <a href="Emperor%20Yao">Emperor Yao</a>. Impressed by the result, the emperor then commanded Jia to select twenty scholars then studying the the "Gongyang Zhuan", instruct them in the "Zuo Zhuan" and compile a new edition and commentary. 

Around 82 CE, he completed three more works in which he compared the "New Text" and "Old Text" versions (i.e. those saved from the <a href="Burning%20of%20books%20and%20burying%20of%20scholars">Qin book burnings</a> by <a href="Fu%20Sheng%20%28scholar%29">Fu Sheng</a> and those discovered in a wall of Confucius' estate and transcribed by <a href="Kong%20Anguo">Kong Anguo</a>) of the "<a href="Book%20of%20Documents">Book of Documents</a>", "<a href="Rites%20of%20Zhou">Rites of Zhou</a>" and the "<a href="Classic%20of%20Poetry">Classic of Poetry</a>".

According to Jia's biography in the "<a href="Book%20of%20the%20Later%20Han">Book of the Later Han</a>", he wrote over a million words commentary on the <a href="Confucian%20classics">Confucian classics</a>, as well as poetry.

Jia was commissioned in 85 CE to produce a report on the fine-tuning of the amended and re-introduced "Sifen" calendar.

Under <a href="Emperor%20He%20of%20Han">Emperor He</a>, he was promoted to General of the Household in 91 CE, and Commandant of the Cavalry in 97 CE. He died in 101 CE, aged 71.

Ina Mihalache

Ina Mihalache (born May 14, 1985), known as Solange, is a Canadian actress, video artist, visual artist, comedian and editor, and lives in France since 2004.

She is mainly known for her YouTube channel "SolangeTeParle", which presents programmes on various subjects and where she adopts the asocial personality of Solange, a character of her invention. She created her channel in November 2011, and met with a timid success, reaching 200,000 subscribers in April 2016. Although the videographer wants to give emotion by the form of her videos rather than by their background (hence her speech), the main interests of Ina Mihalache are culture and art in general, sexuality and feelings.

Biography.
Mihalache was born in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> on May 14, 1985. She is the daughter of a <a href="Romania">Romania</a>n emigre in Canada, Dumitru Mihalache, having fled the dictatorial regime of <a href="Nicolae%20Ceau%C5%9Fescu">Nicolae Ceauşescu</a>; and a Quebec woman, Doris Duguay. At the age of ten, she decided to lose her Quebec accent to adopt the "<a href="French%20of%20France">French of France</a>" accent she heard on the <a href="Radio%20broadcasting">radio</a> or on <a href="Francophonie">French-language</a> <a href="television">television</a> channels such as <a href="TV5Monde">TV5</a>. She explains that this was an "aesthetic choice", which fuels a controversy in her native <a href="Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada">province</a>.

Arriving in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> in 2004, she entered the <a href="Cours%20Florent">Cours Florent</a>. She is admitted to the "Classe Libre", follows the courses of Jean-Pierre Garnier and Olivier L. Brunet, but fails four times in the competition entrance to the <a href="CNSAD">Conservatoire national supérieur d'art dramatique</a>.

Her main artistic and cinematic influences are <a href="Anna%20Karina">Anna Karina</a>, <a href="Emmanuelle%20Riva">Emmanuelle Riva</a>, <a href="Lars%20von%20Trier">Lars von Trier</a>, <a href="Sophie%20Calle">Sophie Calle</a>, and <a href="Tehching%20Hsieh">Tehching Hsieh</a>.

After being revealed to the Talents Cannes de l'Adami by <a href="Mathieu%20Amalric">Mathieu Amalric</a> in the short film "Deux cages sans oiseaux", she devoted herself to the production of atypical works, such as the <a href="trilogy">trilogy</a> "Réussites/Patiences", addressing the questions of inadequacy, The isolation, the idleness, and the nudity of the body in the public space. She also works for <a href="France%20T%C3%A9l%C3%A9visions">France Télévisions</a> as <a href="Film%20editor">editor</a> and <a href="voice-over">voice-over</a>.

In November 2011, she created the blog "Solange te parle", compilation of clips with themes, like <a href="Norman%20Thavaud">Norman Thavaud</a>. The character of Solange delivers comical and often absurd advice to solve the problems of the daily life of a young woman asocial. Her reasonings of <a href="%27Pataphysics">pataphysical</a> character evoke "La Minute nécessaire de monsieur Cyclopède" of <a href="Pierre%20Desproges">Pierre Desproges</a> and <a href="Jean-Louis%20Fournier">Jean-Louis Fournier</a>, or some conceptual experiences of the American artist <a href="John%20Baldessari">John Baldessari</a>. Ina Mihalache later stated about her creation: "Solange is inadequate. She does not know how to do things, but she tries".

In April 2012, she played the character of Sasha Maréchal in the <a href="France%203">France 3</a> documentary: "EtrangesAffaires.com", alongside journalist Patrick Pesnot. Sasha Maréchal illustrated her survey of drawings and animated sequences.

In July 2012, she collaborated with <a href="Radio%20France">Radio France</a> with a series of 54 daily capsules broadcast on <a href="France%20Inter">France Inter</a> on Thomas Baumgartner's "Antibuzz": "Solange lit tous tes tweets" whose themes are taken from a few <a href="Twitter">tweets</a>. She returned on the antennae in February 2013 with the series "Solange dans le bus", diffused every Tuesday in the programme of Pascale Clark "Comme on nous parle". Another series, "Solange pénètre ta vie intime", made up of testimonies of women confiding in Solange, appears on the site of the <a href="Mouv%27">Mouv'</a> on 14 February 2013, broadcast daily on the site of the station until June 2013. The series resumed in January 2014, this time doubling daily on the antenna.

At theatre she plays the title role in the young audience "Virginia Wolf" directed by Nathalie Bensard and adapted from the eponymous album of <a href="Kyo%20Maclear">Kyo Maclear</a> and <a href="Isabelle%20Arsenault">Isabelle Arsenault</a>.

On 6 January 2016, she published her first book, Payange editions, "Solange te parle", inspired by her experience on the Internet.

On 30 January 2016, the screening of her feature film "Solange et les vivants" (screened between 2013 and 2014 and produced by participative financing) began at the Luminor Hôtel de Ville. The national projection began on 9 March 2016.

In October 2016 she joined Le Fresnoy - National Studio of Contemporary Arts in the promotion of <a href="Chantal%20Akerman">Chantal Akerman</a>.

In February 2017, she published her second work entitled "Très intime", verbatim of the chronicles broadcast on Le Mouv, published by Payot, with a foreword.

Daniel Stillwell (active 1715-1718, last name also Stilwell) was a minor pirate in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, best known for his association with <a href="Benjamin%20Hornigold">Benjamin Hornigold</a>.

History.
Formerly of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, Stillwell married the daughter of retired pirate Jonathan Darvill before settling on <a href="Eleuthera">Eleuthera</a>. Borrowing Darvill’s <a href="shallop">shallop</a>, he and a small crew (including Darvill’s son) captured a Spanish ship off of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> which carried over 11,000 <a href="pieces%20of%20eight">pieces of eight</a> around 1714. Deputy Governor Thomas Walker of <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a> heard about the attack and as Spain and England had recently concluded a peace treaty, had Stillwell and his crew seized. Lacking authority to try Stillwell locally, he had Stillwell sent to Jamaica for trial. Hornigold had been using Darvill’s sloop "Happy Return" for his own piracy (and some sources indicate Hornigold had been with Stillwell off of Cuba), and had declared that all the Bahamas pirates were under his protection. He intercepted the ship carrying Stillwell and freed him, returning to Nassau to threaten Walker for interfering.

Stillwell later sailed as a crewmember aboard Hornigold’s ship. When King George offered a general pardon to all pirates who surrendered before September 1718, Stillwell accepted. He later became a ship owner, purchasing several vessels that operated out of the islands, including his father-in-law Jonathan Darvill’s old "Happy Return".

The Artha, Tregare

The Artha, <a href="Tregare">Tregare</a>, <a href="Monmouthshire">Monmouthshire</a> is a farmhouse dating from the mid-17th century. It is a <a href="listed%20buildings">Grade II* listed building</a>.

History.
The architectural historian <a href="John%20Newman%20%28architectural%20historian%29">John Newman</a> dates the original house to c.1600. <a href="Cyril%20Fox">Sir Cyril Fox</a> and <a href="FitzRoy%20Somerset%2C%204th%20Baron%20Raglan">Lord Raglan</a>, in their three-volume study, "Monmouthshire Houses", date the extensions, which make the house such a "showpiece", to 1678-9. The rebuilding was undertaken by Issac Williams, whom <a href="Joseph%20Bradney">Sir Joseph Bradney</a>, the Monmouthshire antiquarian, records as the first known owner of the house.
Bradney further notes that Williams's wife was "a <a href="papist">papist</a> and <a href="recusant">recusant</a>", leading to <a href="John%20Arnold%20of%20Monmouthshire">John Arnold</a>, the local <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> and known persecutor of Catholics, to give evidence against Williams in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Great%20Britain">House of Commons</a>. Arnold declared, "Williams hath his Children Christened by a Popish priest, that his wife is a violent Papist and that <a href="Mass%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Mass</a> is very often said in his House".

Bradney goes on to record the many owners of The Artha into the mid-18th century. The house remains a farmhouse and is in private occupation.

Architecture and description.
The farmhouse is a three-unit, two-storeyed building on an "L"-plan.Newman describes it as "a farmhouse of exceptional pretension". The construction is principally of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> <a href="rubble">rubble</a>, with some of the late-17th century extension being undertaken in <a href="brick">brick</a>. Fox and Raglan note that this is an exceptionally early use of brick in Monmouthshire for a <a href="gentry">gentry</a>, as opposed to an <a href="Aristocracy">aristocratic</a>, house. The <a href="Hip%20roof">hipped</a> roof is of slate. Very large <a href="Chimney">chimney stacks</a> at either end create "an architectural west front of 'dollshouse' symmetry". 

The interior has "exceptionally fine features" including a "remarkable" <a href="Dog-leg%20%28stairs%29">dog-leg stair</a> with carved <a href="newel">newel</a>, "impressive" chimneypieces and an "alarmingly low-slung plaster ceiling" with a central <a href="ceiling%20rose">rose</a> and <a href="cherub">cherub</a> heads at the corners. Fox and Raglan noted that the chimneypieces again demonstrated the house's modernity, the decoration echoing London examples of only some twenty-five years earlier - "the time-lag for metropolitan novelties in our corner of Britain is visibly shortening". The Artha is Grade II* listed.

Danish Auxiliary Corps in Anglo-Dutch service 1701-1714

Having been forced to sue for peace with Sweden in 1700, the Danish army was much larger than the kingdom could support. The king decided to put almost half of the army under Allied command during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. Twelve thousand soldiers were in 1701 made available to the Allied powers in Flanders through a treaty with the Dutch Republic and England. The Danish corps fought under Marlborough at the battles of Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde, and Malplaquet suffering heavy losses. It returned to Denmark in 1713 and 1714.
Background.
The Swedish landing on <a href="Zealand">Zealand</a> forced Denmark out of the coalition that began the <a href="Great%20Nordic%20War">Great Nordic War</a>. Through the <a href="peace%20of%20Travendal">peace of Travendal</a> Denmark had to return <a href="Duke%20of%20Holstein-Gottorp">Holstein-Gottorp</a> to its duke, a Swedish ally, and to leave the anti-Swedish alliance. The large Danish army prepared for a major war against Sweden, became a major burden on the Danish economy, when it couldn't, as anticipated, live off the enemy's land. Downsizing the army was not possible, since the Danish king wanted to retain the option of going to war with Sweden at some future date, in order to regain the provinces lost in the <a href="treaty%20of%20Roskilde">treaty of Roskilde</a> 1658. The Danish king therefore decided to make more than half of the Danish army's 35,000 soldiers, two-thirds of which were enlisted in Germany, available to the Allied powers during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. Political goodwill thus gained, could in addition be useful in any future war with Sweden and Holstein-Gottorp. 
Terms and conditions.
Twelve thousand soldiers were in 1701 made available to the Allied powers through an Danish defensive alliance with the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a>. Of these, three thousand would be horse, one thousand dragoons, and eight thousand foot. As compensation Denmark received 540,000 <a href="rixdollar">rixdollar</a>s as levy money, as well as 300,000 rixdollars annually as long as the war lasted. Previous monetary claims on Denmark were dropped by the powers. The Danish auxiliary corps would be paid and provisioned according to Dutch regulations, and the pay disbursed by Danish <a href="paymaster">paymaster</a>s. At the end of each year's campaign season the Danish corps would receive the same recruitment money as the Dutch army, in order to replace its manpower losses. If a company or regiment would be destroyed, its commanding officer would receive recruitment money sufficiently enough to re-raise it. The agreement expired in ten years. If twelve thousand soldiers were not enough, the Danish king would put another four thousand soldiers at the disposal of the powers. In 1703 two additional regiments, one dragoon and one foot, were raised in the name of the minor <a href="Duchy%20of%20Oels">dukes of Württemberg-Oels</a>. But they were raised by Denmark and formed part of the Danish auxiliary corps, and when the regiments were disbanded after the end of the war, the soldiers were transferred to Danish units. 

Blenheim.
The Danish corps was commanded by duke <a href="Carl%20Rudolf%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg-Neuenstadt">Carl Rudolf of Württemberg</a>. Its infantry embarked in <a href="Gl%C3%BCckstadt">Glückstadt</a> in October 1701, and was landed in <a href="Nordholland">Nordholland</a>. The cavalry crossed the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>, and marched through <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Hanover</a> and <a href="Prince-Bishopric%20of%20M%C3%BCnster">Münster</a> to <a href="Friesland">Friesland</a> och <a href="Brabant">Brabant</a>. During most campaigns, the corps belonged to the Allied armies of <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>. In 1702 it participated in the capture of the <a href="Citadel%20of%20Li%C3%A8ge">Liege citadel</a> after the citizens had open the town gates for Marlborough's army, and in the drawn battle of Beverloo. In 1703 the Württemberg-Oels' regiments joined the corps. In 1704 <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Marlborough</a>'s army marched to southern Germany, but Duke Carl refused to march until the Danish corps was paid. When the matter was settled in Danish favour in the middle of March, the corps was placed in southern Brabant, remaining there until the end of July, when it was ordered to join the main army after a march of 700 km. The cavalry marched strait to <a href="N%C3%B6rdlingen">Nördlingen</a>, the infantry took a longer route and was put under <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Eugene of Savoy</a>'s army in <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>. Hostile <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> was severely harried as punishment for its <a href="Prince-elector">elector</a> having joined <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> against the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Emperor</a>. In August Marlborough's and Eugene's armies merged and won a decisive victory at the <a href="battle%20of%20Blenheim">battle of Blenheim</a>. Danish casualties amounted to 2,300 killed and wounded of the total Allied casualties of 13,000. 

Ramillies.
In the autumn of 1704 the Danish corps, again completely under Marlborough's command, took part in the sieges and captures of <a href="Trarbach">Trarbach</a> and <a href="Saarburg">Saarburg</a>. Its winter quarters were between <a href="Mosel">Mosel</a> and <a href="Rhein">Rhein</a>. The 1705 campaign was spoiled by severe disagreements among the Allied commanders, and no offensive operations took place. In the spring of 1706, duke Carl again refused to march until the Dutch Republic had fulfilled its obligations, and it was not until the end of May that the corps joined Marlborough's army. Especially its cavalry played a large role in the victory at the <a href="battle%20of%20Ramillies">battle of Ramillies</a>, attacking the French and Bavarian flank, losing 600 men and 800 horses. Later participating in the sieges and captures of <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, <a href="Ostend">Ostend</a>, <a href="Menen">Menen</a>, <a href="Ath">Ath</a>, <a href="Dendermonde">Dendermonde</a> and <a href="Oudenaarde">Oudenaarde</a>, it suffered a total of 2,200 soldiers and 1,300 horses lost in 1706. New recruits filled, however, its ranks during the winter. In 1707 Marlborough's army was on the defensive, since half of his troops had been transferred to Spain and Germany. 

Oudenarde and Malplaquet.
In 1708 the French invaded Flanders with a huge army, threatening to land in England, and Eugene of Savoy came to Marlborough's relief with large Imperial army. In the <a href="battle%20of%20Oudenarde">battle of Oudenarde</a> the Danish cavalry under <a href="J%C3%B8rgen%20Rantzau">Jørgen Rantzau</a> made a significant contribution, capturing three French battalions. In all, the campaigns of 1708 led to 3,500 casualties in the Danish corps, but its ranks were soon filled by new recruits, many of which were <a href="defector">defector</a>s and <a href="deserter">deserter</a>s from the French lines. In 1709 the Danish corps remained in its winter quarters until June, awaiting the one million <a href="guilder">guilder</a>s owed by the Dutch Republic. The campaign of 1709 began with the capture of <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a>, followed by the <a href="battle%20of%20Malplaquet">battle of Malplaquet</a>, where the Danish corps lost 1,300 soldiers. Marlborough paid homage to the <a href="Funen%20Life%20Regiment">Fynske Regiment</a> as the most distinguished unit during the battle. The victory made it possible for the Allied to capture <a href="Mons">Mons</a> before the end of the year. The war during the two following years consisted mainly of sieges. In 1712 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">peace negotiations</a> began between France and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and the British government no longer had any use of the Danish regiments in its service. They were, however, immediately taken over by the Dutch Republic. In 1713, the "English" units of the corps returned to Denmark, and in 1714 the rest. 

Order of Battle.
The Danish Auxiliary Corps in Anglo-Dutch services contained 16 squadrons of horse, and nine battalions of foot. A squadron of horse had three companies; each battalion of foot seven companies. The Württemberg-Oels dragoons and foot were added in 1703.

Amabel Anderson Arnold

Amabel Anderson Arnold <a href="LL.M.">LL.M.</a> (May 31, 1883 – February 18, 1936) was a St. Louis lawyer and Law professor who organized the Woman's State Bar Association of Missouri, the first association of women lawyers in the world.

Early life.
Amabel Anderson was born in Chatham, Ontario, on May 31, 1883. Her father was a natural-born United States citizen and her mother beloged to the Burgess family, of English ancestry, known among the most progressive people of <a href="Yarmouth%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Yarmouth, Nova Scotia</a> - well educated, prosperous and of sterling quality. She had one brother, Charles.

The Andersons moved to <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London, Ontario</a> where Anderson attended her first two years of primary education. Summers and the Christmas seasons were spent at their mother's old home near <a href="Aylmer%2C%20Ontario">Aylmer, Ontario</a>. Later the family moved to Michigan, where public school wasn't as progressive as it had been in Canada. Anderson managed to pass her high school entrance examination thanks to the private tutoring of a retired teacher she called "School Madam".

Anderson entered high school at 12 years old at the third district school in <a href="Tuscola%20County%2C%20Michigan">Tuscola County, Michigan</a>. The Anderson family had to move again when Anderson's father was transferred to <a href="Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan">Bay City, Michigan</a>, where Anderson spent the years between 14 and 20; at this time, attending high school, she studied music and sketching. Without completing high school, at 16, she started to teach in the lower grades and at the same time she was actively engaged in church and club work, on several occasions organizing and promoting literary and physical culture clubs.

The chance to attend a course at Ferris Normal School, pushed her to complete her high-school course. She continued to attend the Ferris Normal School, and became the principal of a ten-grade school. She continued to teach and study, and completed the normal course and also a course in painting.

After some years spent as a teacher, in 1910 Anderson entered the City College of Law and Finance, attending the night courses. While attending the College, she was the only woman student in her class. She successfully completed a three years of law school, two of courses and one of lectures. The fourth year, the work field, she enrolled at Benton College of Law, again the only woman. Having attended two law schools, she graduated from both: she received an LL.M. degree from Benton College of Law on June 6, 1912 and a LL.B. from City College of Law and Finance on June 11, 1912.

Career.
In 1907 Anderson moved to St. Louis and she opened and managed for 6 years the Arnold Preparatory School in the Benoist Building. They enrolled many men, and some women, whose early education had been neglected. Anderson and her assistants tutored them privately and placed them in nearly every department of every college and university in St. Louis and in other cities. Anderson built for herself a lasting name as a competent and modern teacher.

In 1908, while operating her own school, Anderson also accepted a position as instructor of Latin in the Dental Department of the <a href="Saint%20Louis%20University">Saint Louis University</a>, the only woman in the faculty. She was also professor of medical botany at the American Medical College, again the only woman instructor.

In 1912 Anderson organized the Women's National College Club, with headquarters in St. Louis, serving as its national president. Her idea was to expanding her school work and prepare to merge her preparatory school to some larger institution.

On July 15, 1912, Anderson was among the St. Louis women attorneys who organized the Woman's State Bar Association of Missouri, the first association of women lawyers in the world.

In September 1913, Anderson was elected director of the Woman's Department at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago%20Law%20School">University of Chicago Law School</a>, the first woman holding such office in the United States.

In 1914 Anderson was appointed on the regular faculty of the City College of Law and Finance as lecturer and instructor in the chair of International Law, again, the only woman holding such a position in St. Louis.

Anderson was an advocate of the <a href="Equal%20Rights%20Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a> and <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">Women's suffrage in the United States</a>. She was a charter member of the <a href="Equal%20Suffrage%20League%20%28St.%20Louis%29">Equal Suffrage League (St. Louis)</a>, and sent out the first invitations to business women, asking them to meet to consider the organization of a league to further suffrage. 

Personal life and death.
Anderson married W. E. Arnold, a medical student at the American Medical College. They divorced December 2, 1912, and she went back to use her maiden name.

Anderson is buried at <a href="Graceland%20Cemetery">Graceland Cemetery</a>, Chicago.

Dear Desolation is the fourth studio album by Australian <a href="deathcore">deathcore</a> band <a href="Thy%20Art%20Is%20Murder">Thy Art Is Murder</a>. The album was released on 18 August 2017 by <a href="Nuclear%20Blast">Nuclear Blast</a>. It is vocalist CJ McMahon's first album with Thy Art Is Murder since his reunion with the band in January 2017.

Background.
Following the release of their third full-length album "Holy War" in 2015, vocalist Chris McMahon left the band. In January 2017 the band announced McMahon's return to the band and released the stand-alone single 'No Absolution' (a b-side from the "Holy War" recording sessions) as part of the announcement. McMahon stated that he had cleaned up his issues with drugs and had also married. As a result, Dear Desolation is vocalist CJ McMahon's first album with Thy Art Is Murder since his departure in 2015.

Critical reception.
The album received generally positive reviews from music critics. Exclaim! described the album as "the band's strongest album to date", and noted the band's stylistic growth in moving away from deathcore towards a more traditional death metal sound inspired by bands like <a href="Behemoth%20%28band%29">Behemoth</a> and <a href="Cannibal%20Corpse">Cannibal Corpse</a>. "<a href="Metal%20Hammer">Metal Hammer</a>" praised McMahon's vocal performance, and wrote that though the album is "short on the penetrative hooks that "<a href="Holy%20War%20%28Thy%20Art%20Is%20Murder%20album%29">Holy War</a>" possessed in abundance, "Into Chaos We Climb" and "The Final Curtain’s" seismic jolts and haunting leads leave an indelible mark for deathcore disciples to latch onto."

Raid on Santiago de Cuba (1603)

The Capture of Santigao De Cuba was a minor military event that took place towards the end of the <a href="Anglo%E2%80%93Spanish%20War%20%281585%29">Anglo–Spanish War</a> in May 1603. Santiago de Cuba was attacked and sacked by English privateers led by Christopher Cleeve.

Events.
Background.
In late February 1603 Christopher Cleeve, in the large armed merchant <a href="galleon">galleon</a> "Elizabeth and Cleeve" along with a <a href="pinnace">pinnace</a> left England on a privateering expedition to raid the <a href="Spanish%20Main">Spanish Main</a>; funded largely by a number of London Merchants.

Cleeve arrived in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> in April; Cleeve's main target was Santiago de Cuba which had escaped attacks by the English since the advent of the Anglo-Spanish war. Santiago de Cuba was the second largest town in Cuba having been founded in 1515. The town had been targeted by pirates before, notably in 1553.

Raid.
On 12 May 1603 the English landed in a bay near Santiago de Cuba and met no resistance. They then took the small but unfinished fort; a <a href="ravelin">ravelin</a> and battery on the south-western beach of the <a href="promontory">promontory</a> which covered the bay from the land side. Soon after Cleeve's men then marched towards the town and then launched an attack. They surprised the militia who attempted some resistance before being overwhelmed and the English then entered the city and went on the rampage. Many of the buildings were plundered including the cathedral <a href="Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20de%20la%20Asunci%C3%B3n">Nuestra Señora de la Asunción</a>, and in all a considerable amount of booty was acquired.

The city was the occupied for a few days before a ransom was then attempted but having no response with this Cleeve ordered his men to set fire to many buildings including the cathedral. In addition all the fortifications were dismantled or destroyed and four vessels were also plundered and burnt. Most of Santiago de Cuba was destroyed and the English pirates left with their booty unmolested after having been in the city for just under a week.

Aftermath.
Cleeve then made a descent on Spanish <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> but left finding supplies and booty too few. Cleeve on his way back home past Cuba however intercepted and captured two small galleons in the <a href="Old%20Bahama%20Channel">Old Bahama Channel</a> 28 August that conveyed the new Spanish governor of Florida <a href="Pedro%20de%20Ibarra">Pedro de Ibarra</a> who was captured.

The raid on Santiago was to be the last major attack on the Spanish Main by the English after nearly thirty years. Soon after <a href="James%20I">James I</a> ordered all privateers to cease while peace negotiations with the Spanish were being held in London which resulted in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%20%281604%29">Treaty of London</a>.

The English returned in 1662 for another strike led by <a href="Christopher%20Myngs">Christopher Myngs</a> at the city; this led to the destruction of the city as well as the the destruction to the <a href="Castillo%20de%20San%20Pedro%20de%20la%20Roca">Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca</a>.

<doc id="54755309" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54755309" title="Little Owl (horse)">
Little Owl (horse)

Little Owl was an English trained racehorse. Undefeated in his first eight completed starts over fences, he was described by Timeform as "potentially one of the most talented steeplechasers since Arkle". Particularly after winning a notably strong Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1981. However, after a series of injuries and a general drop in form, he was never to fulfill his promise and ended his career competing in hunter chases.

Background.
Little Owl was a bay gelding who was purchased at the 1977 Doncaster August Sales by his trainer at the price of 2,300<a href="Guinea%20%28coin%29%23Replacement%20by%20the%20pound">guineas</a>. His Sire, Cantab, was a useful horse on the flat before switching to the jumps for trainer <a href="Ryan%20Price%20%28trainer%29">Ryan Price</a>. His most notable efforts were winning the 1961 Triumph Hurdle and finishing fourth in the 1962 Champion Hurdle. A successful jumps sire, his leading progeny included <a href="Little%20Polveir">Little Polveir</a> (<a href="1989%20Grand%20National">1989 Grand National</a>), The Thinker (1987 <a href="Cheltenham%20Gold%20Cup">Cheltenham Gold Cup</a>), Ballyross (1978 <a href="Powers%20Gold%20Cup">Powers Gold Cup</a>) and Canton (1983 <a href="Scottish%20Grand%20National">Scottish Grand National</a>). His dam, Black Spangle, was a lightly raced half sister to Little Tom - a prolific jumps winner in Ireland and France while her dam, Spangle, was a seven time winner over hurdles. Little Owl's siblings were pointers and platers of little note.

Racing career.
1977/78 season.
Little Owl's career began in a juvenile hurdle on 1 March 1978 at Wetherby where he ran out an eight length winner. He followed up in two further novice events at the same venue during the spring, ending the season unbeaten in three starts.

1978/79 season.
After winning a qualifier for the Coral Golden Handicap Hurdle (currently known as the <a href="Pertemps%20Final">Pertemps Final</a> at Nottingham, Little Owl was sent off favourite while carrying more weight than all but one of his opponents. Despite the race being only his fifth start, he ran with credit chasing home Willie Wumpkins (ironically ridden by Jim Wilson who would become Little Owl's regular jockey) who was six years his senior. Little Owl failed to win his next three starts but regained the winning thread at Market Rasen on his first start under leading amateur Jim Wilson. While success was seemingly assured, the jockey mistook the winning post and had to be rousted along to maintain his position at the finish. No such mistake was made on his next and final outing of the season at Wetherby where, despite conceding 33lb, Little Owl won by twenty lengths from Silversmith who himself had won four races that season. While he did not race outside of handicap company, Little Owl's progression was such that he wound up being rated that season's leading staying hurdler by Timeform - ahead of <a href="Stayers%27%20Hurdle">Stayers' Hurdle</a> winner, Lighter.

1979/80 season.
Instead of challenging the top staying hurdlers, Little Owl was sent novice chasing and he made his seasonal debut in the <a href="Dipper%20Novices%27%20Chase">Dipper Novices' Chase</a> at Newcastle. Despite conceding experience and race fitness to all of his opponents, he jumped immaculately and comfortably prevailed by a length and a half from Peterhof, a former <a href="Triumph%20Hurdle">Triumph Hurdle</a> winner and twice placed in the <a href="Stayers%27%20Hurdle">Stayers' Hurdle</a> in what would be that horses' last start. He was less convincing in his jumping a fortnight later in the <a href="West%20of%20Scotland%20Pattern%20Novices%27%20Chase">West of Scotland Pattern Novices' Chase</a> at Ayr where he beat Irish raider Romany Count by half a length although to his credit, he was giving away 10lb over a trip short of his optimum. Little Owl was seen to better effect next time over three miles in the <a href="Reynoldstown%20Novices%27%20Chase">Reynoldstown Novices' Chase</a> at Ascot where he was well fancied to make it three from three over fences. Again he made several mistakes, blamed on the roving television camera by his jockey, and was still eight lengths behind when Caper's Lad sadly took a fatal fall four out. While whether Little Owl would have won that day was a matter of contention, in the end, he did win the contest by twelve lengths from the average Martinstown. With a perfect record over fences, Little Owl went into the <a href="Sun%20Alliance%20Chase">Sun Alliance Chase</a> as a well fancied second favourite behind <a href="Edward%20O%27Grady">Edward O'Grady</a>'s 1978 <a href="Stayers%27%20Hurdle">Stayers' Hurdle</a> winner Flame Gun. However, the jumping problems which dogged him throughout the season ended his race at the tenth fence.

1980/81 season.
It was the Saturday before Christmas when Little Owl made a winning seasonal reappearance at Doncaster in a conditions event. A race over two and a half miles he was expected to win easily and did so by twenty lengths. He had been purchased by the Wilson family since his last start and it would be Jim Wilson who would ride Little Owl for the rest of his career. Little Owl stepped up in class for his next start in the Peter Marsh Handicap Chase at Haydock. Among his rivals were the veteran <a href="Tied%20Cottage%20%28horse%29">Tied Cottage</a>, who finished eight lengths ahead in the previous season's Gold Cup before losing the race due to a drug test, Ballet Lord, winner of the previous season's <a href="Rowland%20Meyrick%20Handicap%20Chase">Rowland Meyrick Handicap Chase</a> and Straight Jocelyn, twice a winner already that season at Lingfield. Prior to the race, Little Owl was quoted at 14/1 for the Gold Cup alongside Tied Cottage. However, after the latter fell at the eleventh, Little Owl opened up a large lead in the back straight and with sound jumping and resolute galloping, he won by an easy fifteen lengths from Straight Jocelyn, moving towards the head of the Gold Cup market in the process. One week later, he contested the <a href="Cotswold%20Chase">Tote Double Chase</a> at Cheltenham and with Henry Kissinger, who had hitherto won all four completed starts, his only realistic opponent on paper, Little Owl was sent off 8/11 favourite. Due to heavy fog, not much was seen of the race itself. Nevertheless, he reportedly jumped well and in the end, won by six lengths from unfancied novice Lesley Ann (who incidentally, went on to win the <a href="Sun%20Alliance%20Chase">Sun Alliance Chase</a> six weeks later. Little Owl returned to Haydock for his final prep race to contest the inaugural running of the <a href="Timeform%20Chase">Timeform Chase</a>. A valuable race established for novices and second season chasers, it attracted a small field and was effectively a match between Little Owl and leading northern novice <a href="Wayward%20Lad">Wayward Lad</a>. In the event, Wayward Lad fell four from home leaving Little Owl to win by twelve lengths from Fairy King - a winner of two decent handicaps at Ascot and Cheltenham who was in receipt of 10lb.

1981 Cheltenham Gold Cup.
In recent seasons, the Cheltenham Gold Cup was going through a spell in the doldrums. After Tied Cottage's disqualification, the previous renewal fell to Master Smudge, a horse beaten in his six previous starts and whose timeform rating of 150 was decidedly below championship standard. In 1979, the race was taken by Alverton whose fatal fall in that year's Grand National brought much bad publicity to the sport. Indeed it wasn't since 1975 that a Gold Cup winner achieved a timeform rating of 170 or above. However, despite the absences of the likes of Venture To Cognac, Bright Highway and Border Incident, the 1981 renewal was regarded as one of the strongest fields assembled in years. The market was headed by Silver Buck who had won twelve of his thirteen previous starts including two <a href="King%20George%20VI%20Chase">King George VI Chase</a>s. Next in the betting was Little Owl who was joint second favourite with stablemate and dual champion hurdler <a href="Night%20Nurse%20%28horse%29">Night Nurse</a>. Dual <a href="John%20Durkan%20Memorial%20Punchestown%20Chase">Punchestown Chase</a> winner and twice <a href="King%20George%20VI%20Chase">King George VI Chase</a> runner up Jack Of Trumps also featured prominently alongside fellow Irish raider Tied Cottage. Other notable runners included Royal Bond (Premier Chase), 1978 victor Midnight Court, top handicapper Diamond Edge and leading hunter chaser Spartan Missile.

Tied Cottage forced a strong pace from the front but the shape of the race changed when unseating jockey Liam O'Donnell with over a circuit to go. Diamond Edge was left in the lead as they set out on their final lap and was soon joined by Night Nurse with Little Owl tracking them closely in third. Night Nurse increased the tempo and on jumping the final ditch six out, led ahead of Little Owl, Diamond Edge, Silver Buck and Spartan Missile while Royal Bond, who wasn't far behind, made a terrible blunder which put him out of contention. While Night Nurse jumped and travelled well throughout, he was joined at the third last by Little Owl and Silver Buck. The latter two began to pull away approaching the penultimate fence where Silver Buck's error gave Little Owl a clear advantage. With another fine jump over the last, Little Owl galloped resolutely up the Cheltenham hill being chased all the while by Night Nurse as Silver Buck's stamina gave way. Little Owl never looked like getting caught and held off his stablemate's challenge by a length and a half at the line. Having only his ninth start over fences at the young age of seven, Little Owl's display of sound jumping and plentiful class had writers mentioning Peter Easterby's charge in the same breath as <a href="Pendil">Pendil</a> and <a href="Captain%20Christy">Captain Christy</a>. However, given the inherent fragility of steeplechasers, Little Owl would never again attain those heights again nor would he contest another Gold Cup.

1981/82 season.
Like others at Peter Easterby's Habton Grange stables, Little Owl was affected by a virus infection and his comeback was delayed until New Year's Eve for a two and a half mile handicap chase at Cheltenham. Re-opposing old rivals Royal Bond and Henry Kissinger, he began as favourite under top weight. However, he got no further than the eleventh fence when falling while disputing the lead. His second start in the three runner Fulwell Chase was shrouded in controversy after he was pulled up due to the bit slipping through his mouth. Questions were raised after large sums were placed on forecasts involving the other two runners Venture To Cognac, returning after a thirteen month absence, and Great Dean, a 66/1 shot who'd failed to complete his previous two starts. Nevertheless, within a week, the Betting Office Licencees Association determined "there is no reason to withhold payment". In between the Kempton race and his next start at Ascot, he drifted out from 7/2 favourite to 8/1 despite assurances from his owners that nothing was amiss. It was in Ascot's <a href="Swinley%20Chase">Whitbread Trial Handicap Chase</a> where he met his first defeat when completing over fences. Although disappointing, the effort was still respectable as he beaten by less than twelve lengths while giving away upwards of 19lbs to Grand National winners <a href="Aldaniti">Aldaniti</a> and <a href="1982%20Grand%20National">Grittar</a>. Little Owl returned to the track nine days later for a handicap chase at Newcastle where he took a heavy fall while not appearing to travel well. This would be his last appearance of the season and he was hobdayed over the summer.

1982/83 season.
Little Owl returned to the track ten months later in the aptly named "Last Chance Chase", a minor conditions event at Nottingham, where he won in a canter. He followed up with another success nine days later where he defeated Bregawn by ten lengths in the <a href="Tommy%20Whittle%20Chase">Tommy Whittle Chase</a>. Although it later transpired that Bregawn was running with a pulled muscle. Nevertheless, these two successes rekindled faith in Little Owl as he was sent off as 5/2 second favourite for the <a href="King%20George%20VI">King George VI</a> chase splitting Silver Buck and <a href="Wayward%20Lad">Wayward Lad</a> in the betting. However, while he jumped well in the most part, he could only manage a distant fourth. His next start was in the <a href="Peter%20Marsh%20Chase">Peter Marsh Chase</a>, a race which he had won two years prior. Giving upwards of 10lbs away to the likes of Venture To Cognac, Lesley Ann and Ashley House (two handicap wins in past month), he wasn't disgraced in being beaten by less than ten lengths although he did fail to see out the race finishing fourth. He was out a fortnight later for the <a href="Gainsborough%20Chase">Gainsborough Chase</a> at Sandown where he once again failed to see out the race, finishing over twenty lengths behind Observe (who went on to win that season's <a href="Cathcart%20Challenge%20Cup">Cathcart Challenge Cup</a>) and the ten year old Royal Judgement. This was his last race for the season and along with another breathing operation over the summer, he was also diagnosed with a trapped epiglottis.

1983/84 season.
Little Owl's seasonal reappearance came with an attempt at successive victories in Haydock's <a href="Tommy%20Whittle%20Chase">Tommy Whittle Chase</a>. The task was made easier when odds on favourite, Bregawn, fell three from home although he still had to play second fiddle to Prince Rowan who was no better than a decent handicapper. Not entered for the King George VI Chase, Little Owl contested the <a href="Rowland%20Meyrick%20Handicap%20Chase">Rowland Meyrick Handicap Chase</a> at Wetherby instead where he finished fifth behind Phil The Fluter while conceding weight all round. His final start of the season came in the <a href="Anthony%20Mildmay%2C%20Peter%20Cazalet%20Memorial%20Chase">Anthony Mildmay, Peter Cazalet Memorial Chase</a> where following a first fence unseat, he tore ligaments and muscles in his hind quarters and sustained a suspected broken pelvis after galloping loose.

1984/85 season.
For his final season, Little Owl joined trainer John Edwards and competed in a pair of hunter chases. In his first hunter chase, he was beaten thirty two lengths into sixth before finishing a similar distance into second behind old rival Royal Judgement at Wincanton.

<doc id="54755315" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54755315" title="The Aetherverse">
The Aetherverse

The Aetherverse is a 2016 <a href="Minarchism">minarchist</a> <a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a> by American authors J. D'Urso and E. Bryan.

Described as "a space opera for troubled times," "The Aetherverse" is set several millennia in the future, in a dystopian Milky Way galaxy controlled by the dysfunctional, corrupt Interstellar Convergency. The plot focuses on the dangerous involvement of mega-corporations in government, and the ideological hegemony of the Albian Banking Advancement Conglomerate (ABAC), the galaxy's de facto central bank and propagator of oppressive, failed political policy.

The novel can be described as a <a href="satire">satire</a> of modern American politics and society, presenting a number of parody characters bearing resemblance to real-life political figures, and addressing major current events, including the rise of socialism in the United States and the increased prominence of religious extremism.

The novel is prefaced by "Aethertales", a series of independent novelettes in four volumes: "Warriors of Vega", "Bordello della Libertà", "A Swarm of Locusts", and "A Red Earth Rises", all of which provide a context for the plot and themes of "The Aetherverse".

Premise.
Far into the future in the year 2869 Æx., humanity has settled most of the known galaxy, establishing vast <a href="eparchies">eparchies</a> spanning the Outer Rim to the Deep Core. The majority of these states are members of the Interstellar Convergency, an intergovernmental organization and political-economic union established for the promotion of pan-galactic cooperation and unity. The Convergency functions through a complex set of institutions on a supranational level, operating as a monstrous, inept bureaucracy. The major economic and political power in the Convergency is the highly libertarian League of Arterra, a powerful defense and trade alliance. The League, led by the United Colonies of Acadia, are opposed by the corporatist conglomerate ABAC, which has established itself as the Convergency's de facto central bank, and is the union of collectivist and welfare state interests. This has led to an ideological conflict that threatens to collapse the Convergency from within.

The galactic economy is built on the scarcity of aetherium, a naturally occurring element and only known fuel source for faster-than-light travel. The League of Arterra and its allies universally use an aetherium standard for their currencies, while their opponents do not, rendering the Convergent lira virtually worthless. Aetherium is essential for galactic trade, as it permits entry into the Aether, or Aetherspace, a normally inaccessible pocket of reality in which known physics do not apply; the Aether contains a web of <a href="tachyon">tachyon</a> veins along which spacecraft may travel in currents of high-energy particles. As part of a massive conspiracy, ABAC seeks to seize complete control over the Aether, so that it might become the Convergency's most formidable political and military force.

Factions.
The Convergent Congress, consisting of Parliament, the Senate, and the Executive Council, is an arena for two major ideological factions: the minarchist objectivist, and corporatist collectivists. There are, however, some unaffiliated or neutral parties.

Minarchist objectivists.
Championed by the League of Arterra and the United Colonies of Acadia in particular, the <a href="Minarchism">minarchist</a> <a href="Objectivism%20%28Ayn%20Rand%29">objectivists</a> represent <a href="Capitalism">capitalist</a>, <a href="Individualism">individualist</a> ideals. The minarchist objectivist ideology emphasizes the rights and freedoms of the individual and the innate sovereignty over one's own existence without the forced obligation to support and improve the lives of others. It is admittedly inspired by the objectivist philosophy of <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a>.

Corporatist collectivists.
Led by ABAC and its corporate allies, the <a href="Corporatism">corporatist</a> <a href="Collectivism">collectivists</a> are a <a href="statist">statist</a>, <a href="Authoritarianism">authoritarian</a> faction in support of a far-reaching, centralized government and personal dependence on the state. The corporatist collectivist ideology is centered around a vision of <a href="totalitarian%20government">totalitarian government</a> and the <a href="welfare%20state">welfare state</a>, as well as a concept of institutionalized, false <a href="altruism">altruism</a>.

Amaneciendo

Amaneciendo is the thirteenth studio album by <a href="Camilo%20Sesto">Camilo Sesto</a>. The first audio Cassette was released in 1980. The album contains two of his most successful singles of his career; beginning with, "Perdóname", a coded ballad dedicated to his mother, as well as "Donde Estés Con Quien Estés", which reached No. 1 in Spain and Latin America. It has broken records for selling more than 10 million copies in less than a year.

"Perdóname" Ranked at "The Billboard Top 40" for 18 consecutive weeks. In addition "Donde Estés Con Quien Estés" , "Un Amor No Muere Así Como Así" , "Días De Vino y De Rosas" , "Vivir Sin Ti" and "Samba" had their first place in some countries that were published as singles.

Background.
Leaving his fans with an a formally impeccable performance and a handful of songs that had hardly evolved in ten years from his previous album. By the end of 1980 Camilo Sesto released, what to become his most successful album to date, yet the most foreign to what was around "Latin music" at the time. Hymns and more introspective ballads were unheard of, yet was made with "little inspiration". This Album is led by the hits such as "Perdóname", "Un Amor No Muere Así Como Así", "Amor A Plena Luz", "Tres Veces No", "Que Nos Pasa Esta Mañana" and "Donde Estés Con Quien Estés". Though, Camilo turns into a party ball that crosses the bitter ocean in the latter half of the album, none of which songs were promoted, nor known at the time.

Jordanian local elections, 2017

On 15 August 2017, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> held local elections for three levels of government: mayoralties, <a href="Municipal%20council%20%28Jordan%29">municipal</a> and <a href="Local%20council%20%28Jordan%29">local councils</a>, and <a href="Governorate%20council%20%28Jordan%29">governorate councils</a>. 

While the municipal and local councils have been elected consistently since 1925, the governorate council elections are the first of their kind in Jordan, with the councils established by a new 2014 <a href="decentralization">decentralization</a> law. The Law aims to reduce service-related pressure on the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Jordan">Parliament</a>, so it can focus on its legislative and government oversight role.

6,623 Jordanians competed for 1,838 seats in the municipal and local councils, 303 in the governorate councils, and 100 posts for mayor. There are designated <a href="Women%20in%20government%23Quotas">quotas</a> for women in all posts.

Electoral system.
<a href="Municipal%20council%20%28Jordan%29">Municipal</a> and <a href="Local%20council%20%28Jordan%29">local council</a> elections have been held consistently since 1925. These elections were the first to witness <a href="Governorate%20council%20%28Jordan%29">governorate councils</a> which were added by a 2014 <a href="Decentralization">Decentralization</a> Law. The Law intends to reduce the pressure of service and development related issues on the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Jordan">Parliament</a>, so it can perform its legislative and oversight over government effectively. The law also intends to cede some central-government power to elected councils, increasing citizen participation in municipal decision-making. The Municipalities Law was also reformed around the same period. In a 15 August 2016 interview, <a href="Abdullah%20II%20of%20Jordan">King Abdullah II</a> described the new decentralization law as "a very important link in the chain of reforms".

The Kingdom is divided into 100 municipalities: 82 municipalities with 355 local councils, and 18 municipalities with none (due to their small size). There are 1,838 members of the municipal and local councils. Mayors will be directly elected for each municipality. The municipalities, excluding the <a href="Aqaba%20Special%20Economic%20Zone%20Authority">Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority</a> and the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority, will be run by a municipal council that includes at least 7 members. The members of the municipal councils include the mayor and heads of the local councils (highest voted for members). Each local council consists of 5 members, including at least one woman. The Decentralization Law divided the Kingdom into 158 constituencies, which will witness the election of 12 <a href="Governorates%20of%20Jordan">governorate</a> councils with 381 members. 85% of governorate councils members will be elected, and 15% appointed by the government. The elected 303 members of governorate councils, have a 10% quota for women (32 seats). A third of the appointed 45 members are required to be women (15 seats).

The <a href="Greater%20Amman%20Municipality">Greater Amman Municipality</a> (GAM), has a special law. <a href="Amman">Amman</a>'s mayor will be appointed by the cabinet from the 38-member municipal council (does not have a local council) which is 75% elected (22 members, one from each locality) and 25% appointed (10 members). There is a six-seat quota for the highest voted-for women.

Municipal and local councils are responsible for administering municipal services, while the governorate councils are tasked with monitoring and suggesting development projects, and formulating the municipality's budget. They also perform an oversight role over the local government, which is the executive council headed by a governor. Jordanians are required to be 25 years or older to be eligible for the elections.

The municipal and local councils were dissolved on 12 March 2017, and temporary committees were appointed to run municipalities until the elections on 15 August.

Elections.
The <a href="Independent%20Election%20Commission%20%28Jordan%29">Independent Election Commission</a> trained some 19,000 volunteers for an awareness campaign on the municipal and decentralization laws.

6,950 Jordanians have registered their candidacies for the elections by 6 July: 611 men and 6 women mayoral candidates, 3,772 men and 1,094 women for municipal and local councils membership, 1,195 men and 119 women for governorate council membership, and 140 men and 13 women for GAM's council.

After the end of the withdrawal period on 1 August, 327 candidates either withdrew or their candidacies were rejected by courts after appeals. The final candidates list includes 6,623 Jordanians: 538 mayoral candidates, 4,701 for municipal and local councils membership, 1,239 for governorate council membership, and 145 for GAM's council.

With the final candidates list issued, elections in 21 local councils were cancelled after its candidates won by <a href="acclamation">acclamation</a>. 68 women also won by acclamation.

Voters were given three ballot papers: blue papers for mayor posts where only one candidate can be selected; green papers for governorate council seats where one or two candidates (depending on what is located for each district) can be selected; and white papers for municipal and local councils where five candidates can be selected (including one female). Otherwise, the ballot paper will be considered null. GAM residents will vote on a green paper for governorate council seats where one or two candidates (depending on what is allocated for each district) can be selected; and on a white paper for the membership of the municipal council (GAM council) where only one candidate can be selected.

The elections were held on 15 August, starting at 7:00 am and lasting until 7:00 pm, while the Amman, Zarqa and Irbid areas' elections were extended to 9:00 pm. The elections went as planned with the exception of the central <a href="Badia">Badia</a>, where a candidate's supporters attacked two ballot boxes. The turnout was 31.7%: <a href="Amman">Amman</a> and <a href="Zarqa">Zarqa</a> witnessed the lowest voting turnout in the country, while <a href="Jerash">Jerash</a> and <a href="Ajloun">Ajloun</a> the greatest.

At the end of 2012 she moved to <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and, while living in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, frequently travels around the world with her band Zap, which she describes as "a crazy mixture of swing, jazz music, performance and weird percussion" consisting of "a washboard, megaphone, ukulele, rubber chicken, some tap shoes, a trumpet, two kangaroos and some tzatziki", including her role as "sequined showgirl meets sideshow superstar with a bottomless bag of tricks – whether it be dancing, juggling or throwing confetti".

While in Australia, Miller co-starred in writer-director Laura Smith's 2012 short film "The Outback Motel" and, in 2015, played one of two female characters in writer-director Berton Pierce's Irish-German science fiction road film "Adventurados".

They were produced in Berlin and <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in a series of four- to five-day shoots.

In the <a href="mathematics">mathematical</a> field of <a href="graph%20theory">graph theory</a>, the pancake graph "P" or "n"-pancake graph is a graph whose vertices are the permutations of "n" symbols from 1 to "n" and its edges are given between permutations transitive by prefix reversals. 

<a href="Pancake%20sorting">Pancake sorting</a> is the colloquial term for the mathematical problem of sorting a disordered stack of <a href="pancake">pancake</a>s in order of size when a <a href="spatula">spatula</a> can be inserted at any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it. A "pancake number" is the minimum number of flips required for a given number of pancakes. Obtaining the pancake number and the problem to obtain the <a href="Distance%20%28graph%20theory%29">diameter</a> of the pancake graph is equivalent.

The pancake graph of dimension "n", "P" is a <a href="regular%20graph">regular graph</a> with n! vertices, its degree is "n" − 1. "P" can be constructed recursively from n copies of "P", by assigning a different element from the set {1, 2, …, "n"} as a suffix to each copy.

In a "P" ("n" ≥ 3) pancake graph there is always at least one <a href="Cycle%20%28graph%20theory%29">cycle</a> of lenght "ℓ", when formula_12 (but there are no cycles of length 3, 4 or 5). It implies that the graph is <a href="Hamiltonian%20path">Hamiltonian</a> and any two vertex can be joined by a Hamiltonian path.

About the 6-cycles of the "P" ("n" ≥ 4) pancake graph: every vertex belongs to exactly one 6-cycle. The graph contains formula_13 independent (vertex-disjoint) 6-cycles.

About the 7-cycles of the "P" ("n" ≥ 4) pancake graph: every vertex belongs to formula_14 7-cyles. The graph contains formula_15 different 7-cycles.

About the 8-cycles of the "P" ("n" ≥ 4) pancake graph: the graph contains formula_16 different 8-cycles; a maximal set of independent 8-cycles contains formula_17 of those.

Diameter.
The pancake sorting problem (obtaining the pancake number) and obtaining the diameter of the pancake graph are equivalents. One of the main difficulties in solving this problem is the complicated <a href="Cycle%20%28graph%20theory%29">cycle</a> structure of the pancake graph.

The pancake number, which is the minimum number of flips required to sort any stack of pancakes has been shown to lie between and (approximately 1.07"n" and 1.64"n",) but the exact value is not known.

In 1979, <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a> and <a href="Christos%20Papadimitriou">Christos Papadimitriou</a> gave an upper bound of . This was improved, thirty years later, to by a team of researchers at the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Dallas">University of Texas at Dallas</a>, led by Founders Professor <a href="Hal%20Sudborough">Hal Sudborough</a> (Chitturi et al., 2009).

In 2011, Laurent Bulteau, Guillaume Fertin, and Irena Rusu proved that the problem of finding the shortest sequence of flips for a given stack of pancakes is NP-hard, thereby answering a question that had been open for over three decades.

Burnt pancake graph.
In a variation called the burnt pancake problem, the bottom of each pancake in the pile is burnt, and the sort must be completed with the burnt side of every pancake down. It is a "signed permutation", and if a pancake "i" is "burnt side up" a negative element "i`" is put in place of "i" in the permutation. The burnt pancake graph is the graph representation of this problem.

A formula_18 burnt pancake graph is <a href="regular%20graph">regular</a>, its order is formula_19, its degree is formula_20.

For its variant David S. Cohen (<a href="David%20X.%20Cohen">David X. Cohen</a>) and <a href="Manuel%20Blum">Manuel Blum</a> proved in 1995, that formula_21 (when the upper limit is only true if formula_22).

The girth of a burnt pancake graph is:

Other classes of pancake graphs.
Both in the original pancake sorting problem and the burnt pancake problem, "prefix reversal" was the operation connecting two permutations. If we allow non-prefixed reversals (as if we were flipping with two spatulas instead of one) then four classes of pancake graphs can be defined. Every pancake graph embeds in all higher-order pancake graphs of the same family.

Applications.
Since pancake graphs have many interesting properties such as symmetric and recursive structures (they are <a href="Cayley%20graph">Cayley graph</a>s, thus are <a href="Vertex-transitive%20graph">vertex-transitive</a>), sublogarithmic degree and diameter, and are relatively <a href="Dense%20graph">sparse</a> (compared to e.g. <a href="Hypercube%20graph">hypercubes</a>), much attention is paid to them as a model of interconnection networks for parallel computers. When we regard the pancake graphs as the model of the interconnection networks, the diameter of the graph is a measure that represents the delay of communication. Other interesting properties are: extendability, high connectivity (robustness), easy routing, regularity of topology, fault tolerance, extensibility and embeddability of other topologies.

Pancake flipping has biological applications as well, in the field of genetic examinations. In one kind of large-scale mutations a large segment of the genome gets reversed, which is analogous to the burnt pancake problem.

Anova Culinary

Anova Culinary (known legally as Anova Applied Electronics, Inc.) is a <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>-based smart kitchen company that provides connected precision <a href="Home%20appliance">cooking appliances</a>, such as a <a href="Sous-vide">sous vide</a> <a href="Machine">device</a> for the home cook in 2013 with the Anova One. In 2014, Anova introduced the first connected precision cooking device with the <a href="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a>-enabled Anova Precision Cooker, followed by a <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a>-enabled version in 2015 with the introduction of the Anova Precision Cooker Wi-Fi.

Anova was acquired by <a href="home%20appliance">home appliance</a> company <a href="Electrolux">Electrolux</a> on February 6, 2017 for $250 million USD, marking the first multi-million dollar <a href="Takeover">acquisition</a> of a smart kitchen brand.

History.
Anova Culinary was founded in 2013 by Stephen Svajian, Jeff Wu, and Natalie Vaughn. The company stemmed from a <a href="scientific%20equipment">scientific equipment</a> manufacturer of <a href="temperature%20control">temperature control</a> products for <a href="Laboratory">laboratories</a> worldwide.

In 2010, Wu had an early <a href="proof%20of%20concept">proof of concept</a> for an affordable home <a href="Sous-vide">sous vide</a> device. Shortly after, he and Vaughn teamed up with Stephen Svajian, <a href="Chief%20executive%20officer">CEO</a> and founder of <a href="marketing">marketing</a> agency Get Fresh Inc., which led to the launch and founding of Anova Culinary. In 2013, Svajian, Wu and Vaughn shipped their first product, the Anova One.

Products and services.
Anova originally launched the first version of its water circulator, the Anova One, back in 2013. The company took off following the release of the second-generation model, Anova Precision Cooker in 2014.

Products.
Anova One.
The Anova One was the first sous vide precision cooker built for the home cook. Launched in 2013, the device was a lab-grade <a href="immersion%20circulator">immersion circulator</a> that made the once inaccessible restaurant technique of sous vide cooking available to the home cook at a low price point. It clamps on to an existing pot and circulates water as it heats.

Anova Precision Cooker.
In 2014, Anova introduced the first connected precision cooking device Anova Precision Cooker with a successful campaign on the <a href="Crowdfunding%20websites">crowdfunding website</a> <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a>. The Precision Cooker debuted on <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> with a goal of $100,000 USD. It quickly became the most funded food campaign with 10,508 backers pledging $1,811,321 USD.

The Precision Cooker is a wand-like <a href="Sous-vide">sous vide</a> <a href="immersion%20circulator">immersion circulator</a> that attaches to a pot or container, heats and maintains water at a precise temperature to cook food to a set time and temperature. It is <a href="Bluetooth">Bluetooth-enabled</a> and connects with the Anova Culinary App, allowing people to cook with temperature control and helping <a href="Gourmand">gourmands</a> tap into a seemingly complex cooking technique that was limited to restaurants with expensive, bulky machinery.

Anova Precision Cooker Wi-Fi.
The Anova Precision Cooker <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> is the first smart <a href="Sous-vide">sous vide</a> device to hit the market. Using a Wi-Fi app, users can start, stop, and monitor their cook while away from the kitchen. It notifies users when their food is ready, and keeps it warm until they're ready to eat. It is Anova's only device that has <a href="Voice%20command%20device">voice control</a> integration with <a href="Amazon%20Alexa">Amazon Alexa</a> and <a href="Google%20Home">Google Home</a>.

Apple started offering the Anova Wi-Fi Precision Cooker both online and in its retail stores, marking the first smart cooking device the company has sold to customers.

Anova Precision Cooker Nano.
The Anova Precision Cooker Nano is the first lab-grade <a href="Sous-vide">sous vide</a> cooking device for under $100. The <a href="Bluetooth">Bluetooth-enabled</a> Nano supports multi-device communication through the Anova Culinary <a href="Application%20software">App</a>, so users can coordinate cooking cycles with multiple dishes using Anova products. Users can <a href="Synchronization">synchronize</a> meals to finish each dish at the same time. 

The Precision Cooker Nano has the same control over temperature that its sous vide siblings get, but goes simpler. It has no Wi-Fi, only Bluetooth in order to connect to the user's <a href="smartphone">smartphone</a>. Basic controls are on the Precision Cooker Nano itself, for app-free control. 

The Nano is water resistant to a IP67. It handles up to 3 gallons (11 liters) of water, and up to 99 hour cook-times. It has a 700W heater, and a 360-degree pump for more consistent heating, and works with a water bath-fill of 2.44-inches.

The Nano receives phone <a href="Push%20Notification">push-notifications</a> on cooking status via Bluetooth within range. The speaker on the Nano gives notifications similar to a cell phone. It is the only sous vide device that has a water-resistant Milar speaker.

Anova Precision Oven.
The Anova Precision Oven is a <a href="countertop">countertop</a> device meant to work in <a href="tandem">tandem</a> with the Precision Cooker to allow precise temperature control for cooking. The countertop oven sears, convection bakes, steam cooks while connecting to the precision cookers.

Services.
Anova Culinary App.
The Anova Culinary <a href="Application%20software">App</a> is the <a href="companion%20app">companion app</a> to the Anova Precision Cooker. The App, available on <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> and <a href="iOS">iOS</a>, enables users to find food, adjust the settings, and the app takes it from there. 

Anova teamed up with <a href="J.%20Kenji%20L%C3%B3pez-Alt">J. Kenji Lopez-Alt</a> through an exclusive partnership with <a href="Serious%20Eats">Serious Eats</a> to create sous vide recipes and time and temperature guides for the app. The user doesn't have to search for time and temperature settings to cook. New time and temperature guides are added regularly so that users can cook at the touch of a button. The app includes a selection of sous vide recipes from <a href="James%20Beard%20Foundation%20Award">James Beard award</a>-winning chefs and food writes as well as featured recipes from users in the community.

Alexa Skill & Google Home Actions.
Alexa Skill and Google Home Action allow users to input commands and options like the protein type, <a href="doneness">doneness</a> and thickness via voice in a series of commands the same way a person would navigate a branching tree of selections in the app to to work through a cook through ‘Guided Cook’ capabilities. It was originally conceived after David Zielezna shared his new Alexa skill on Reddit. After creating a stir in the /sousvide <a href="reddit">reddit</a>, an Anova representative reached out to David.


Acquisitions.
Get Fresh, Inc..
In 2015, Anova Culinary acquired <a href="Marketing">marketing agency</a> Get Fresh, Inc. for $9.2M USD. 

Prior to that, Get Fresh worked closely with 15 early hardware brands, including Anova. As Anova’s business grew, it offered to buy Get Fresh and make Svajian <a href="CEO">CEO</a>, a role he said he was already filling in some ways. Get Fresh investors include <a href="David%20O.%20Sacks">David Sacks</a>, <a href="Jason%20Calacanis">Jason Calacanis</a> and Jim Patterson.

Emma Clara Schweer

Emma Clara Schweer (; April 28, 1896 – July 25, 2001) served as tax collector of <a href="Crete%20Township%2C%20Will%20County%2C%20Illinois">Crete Township, Will County, Illinois</a>, and, at the time of her death, was believed to be the oldest elected official in the United States.

Biography.
Schweer was born in 1896 in <a href="Ocheyedan%2C%20Iowa">Ocheyedan, Iowa</a>, and moved to Crete Township in 1905. She attended Trinity Lutheran School, where she took classes in <a href="German%20language">German</a>, and Miles Business College. Schweer became a <a href="Aircraft%20pilot">pilot</a> and later trained <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> pilots.

Schweer's husband, Arthur F. Schweer, held the position of tax collector from its creation in 1933 until his death in 1965; they married in 1923 and he had previously served as <a href="Crete%2C%20Illinois">Crete</a>'s fire chief. Upon his death, Schweer, who had served as his deputy for his entire term, was appointed to the post, and elected in her own right seventeen times, the last in April 2001. During her later years, she was reluctant to run although agreed once nominated. Schweer ran unopposed in many of her later elections.

Schweer was a lifelong <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> and frequently attended <a href="Will%20County%2C%20Illinois">Will County</a> Republican Party events. She was also active in the Crete Historical Society, and drove until shortly before her death. She was co-owner of Schweer Gas & Appliance in Crete, along with her husband.

Schweer was also known for her elegant manner of dress; in one incident in 2001 she arrived late to her swearing-in ceremony because her shoes and purse did not match. A friend described her, saying, "Emma was such a refined lady. She always dressed like she was going to church. Toward the end, she had some loss of hearing, but she was very lucid. She read a lot and knew everything that was going on around the world."

Due to her position as the country's oldest elected politician, Schweer received national media attention in 2001, and was featured in the "<a href="National%20Enquirer">National Enquirer</a>". She died on July 25, 2001 at St. James Hospital in <a href="Chicago%20Heights%2C%20Illinois">Chicago Heights, Illinois</a>, at the age of 105.

<doc id="54756053" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54756053" title="V-61">
V-61

V-61 (c. 1962 - 1974) was a hall of fame <a href="bucking%20bull">bucking bull</a> known only by his <a href="livestock%20branding">brand</a>, #V-61. In 1970 he was the <a href="Professional%20Rodeo%20Cowboys%20Association">Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association</a> (PRCA) Bull of the Year. In 2012, the <a href="Texas%20Rodeo%20Cowboy%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame</a> inducted V-61. In 2015, the <a href="Bull%20Riding%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Bull Riding Hall of Fame</a> inducted him into its inaugural class. In 930 attempts, only five <a href="Bull%20riding">bull riders</a> managed to complete qualified rides on him. His owner retired him in January of 1974 but his retirement was short-lived as he died later that year.

Background and early career.
V-61 was most likely born in 1962 since a veterinarian estimated his age at 9 years old in 1971. A Texas rancher named Rudy Vela bought the weaned, juvenile bull V-61 at a beef cattle sale of cows that had been culled into categories of canners and cutters. Apparently, V-61 had been an orphan calf and bottle-raised. Vela deemed the bull more suited to bucking than to be raised for beef since he never outgrew the "funny quirks" Vela felt all orphan calves possess. He branded the junior bull on the hip and raised him to adulthood. V-61 also was unsuitable for breeding since he was unregistered. Due to these considerations, Vela resold the young bull for rodeo stock. While Vela owned V-61, he never bucked the bull. He did, however, tie a dummy on his back a few times. Every time V-61 sent that dummy flying before the requisite eight seconds was up. And for four years on the amateur circuit with his next owner, Sloan Williams, he remained unridden. It got to the point where the cowboys would not even get on him.

In 1968, Harry Knight was looking to retire as a <a href="stock%20contractor">stock contractor</a>, and he was offering his rodeo company for sale. Billy Minick was interested because Knight had good bucking stock, so he purchased Knight's Rodeo Company. Minick traded rodeo competition for contracting, creating the Billy Minick Rodeo Company. Next, in 1969, Sloan Williams was providing Billy Minick with calves for rodeo <a href="calf%20roping">calf roping</a> events. Williams owned V-61 at that time, having bought him from Vela. Sloan pressed Minick about buying the bull, saying, “No one will get on him any more at our rodeos, he’s such a hard bucker. I’m hauling him for nothing. Would you like him?" Minick and his father drove a gooseneck trailer to Williams' place in <a href="Hungerford%2C%20Texas">Hungerford, Texas</a>, and picked up V-61 and another bull. After Minick bought V-61, and he started bucking the bull on the PRCA (known as the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA) at the time) circuit, V-61 quickly became known as a bull no one could ride.

None of his owners ever named V-61; he had a brand on his hip and that was how he became known. His sire was claimed to be a <a href="Brahman%20%28cattle%29">Brahma bull</a>, and his dam was a <a href="Jersey%20%28cattle%29">Jersey cow</a>. V-61's head was Jersey-colored, and the rest of him was generally gray. He weighed . When the Vela's were inducted into the Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame, Minick took the opportunity to confirm that V-61 was definitely raised on a bottle.

PRCA.
For his first taste of the PRCA, in 1969, at the <a href="National%20Finals%20Rodeo">National Finals Rodeo</a> (NFR), every bucking bull was bucked two times, except V-61, who was bucked three times. He still bucked off all three riders.

In 1970, his first full season in the PRCA, his threw all 23 riders who drew him that year. At the NFR in that year, he was named PRCA Bull of the Year. He bucked off three riders in the finals that year. He bucked off Bobby Berger, Sandy Kirby, and bucked off and severely injured Dicky Cox, who had to spend several days in the hospital. The bull gained such a reputation that <a href="Life%20Magazine">Life Magazine</a> featured him in the same issue when <a href="Muhammed%20Ali">Muhammed Ali</a> appeared on the cover. Life Magazine traveled to <a href="Cheyenne%20Frontier%20Days">Cheyenne Frontier Days</a> especially for the story. The feature appeared in the October 23, 1970, issue of the magazine.

In early 1971, in <a href="San%20Angelo%2C%20Texas">San Angelo, Texas</a>, World Bull Riding Champion <a href="Warren%20G.%20Brown">Freckles Brown</a> drew V-61. At the time, Brown was 50 years old. Minick was concerned about the match because of Brown's age and because V-61 bucked so hard. However, his fears were allayed when the bull left the chute "like a milk cow" and in about six seconds the bull dropped a shoulder and dumped Brown.

In 1971, at Cheyenne Frontier Days, in <a href="Cheyenne%2C%20Wyoming">Cheyenne, Wyoming</a>, Rodney Nelson was competing at amateur bronc riding. He stayed to watch the bull riding because multiple hall of famer <a href="Myrtis%20Dightman">Myrtis Dightman</a> had drawn V-61. He related that V-61 jumped out of the chute with Dightman on top and dispatched him in a couple jumps that even a horse might have trouble matching. The images stuck in his mind for a long time because it was such a tremendous effort for both parties. Also, prior to riding the bull, Dightman had told Minick he could ride V-61. Minick was of the opposite opinion. While Minick watched Dightman prepare in the chute, he said, “I watched him pull his rope tight, then he let the rope off a little, then he pulled it tight again. When the chute opened Dightman went off the bull in a very few seconds.”

The ride heard around the world.
On June 6, 1971, in <a href="Gladewater%2C%20Texas">Gladewater, Texas</a>, at the Gladewater Round-Up Rodeo, V-61 met his match. 1972 World Bull Riding Champion <a href="Johnny%20Quintana">Johnny Quintana</a> rode him for the first time and scored a high score of 94 points. The ride was so momentous that many couldn't hear the buzzer due to the noise of the crowd. Quintana later rode the bull again that year. Quintana was later inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame. Minick once admitted that Quintana was the man he thought might be able to ride his bull. Later on, amateur bronc rider Roddy Nelson was talking to North Dakota rodeo legend Duane Howard about V-61. He inquired of Howard as to whether he had seen Quintana ride him the first time he had gotten a qualified ride. “I judged that rodeo,” Duane said. “It was awesome! The noise from the crowd was so loud there was no way anyone could hear the whistle, but I had timed the ride on my stopwatch and knew John had conquered him!” The score only stood for a year; several riders broke the highest score record in the 1970s, including Quintana again.

Ralph Lane, a fan, recalls running from the far end of the arena when he heard Quintana was about to mount V-61. Minick, who was living in Fort Worth, Texas, at the time, had counted V-61 unridden in 466 attempts in the PRCA and several hundred in amateur rodeos. "After Quintana rode the bull three or four jumps and it began to look like he was going to ride him, the crowd started cheering and coming to their feet." Lane said. Lane added, "I remember Billy Minick throwing his feet down and hollering. 'He didn't make! He didn't make it!" However, two judges said otherwise: Quintana had made it to the eight-second mark.

Quintana scored a record high score of 94 points on V-61 on that ride, which was the highest score ever recorded at that time in a bucking stock event. Minick was disappointed that V-61's unridden streak was broken. He had many great roughstock, but V-61 was the best. Wherever he went, they promoted the bull. Tommy Morse, a Gladewater rodeo organizer who saw Quintana's ride, said, "It seemed the longer he rode him, the higher the bull jumped. It was a ride heard around the world."

Illness.
In August of 1971, a 9 year old V-61 suffered a <a href="hematoma">hematoma</a> of the <a href="Testicular%20artery">spermatic vessel</a>. Minick took the bull to see Dr. W.A. Aanes at <a href="Colorado%20State%20University">Colorado State University</a> in <a href="Fort%20Collins%2C%20Colorado">Fort Collins, Colorado</a>. They operated on the bull, and the surgery went well; it was less dangerous than expected. V-61 became a popular patient during his stay. Dr. Aanes was a good friend of <a href="Paul%20Harvey">Paul Harvey</a>, the well-known radio announcer, and for the duration of the bull's stay, Harvey reported on his condition. In September, V-61 returned home to convalesce under doctor's orders until the NFR.

Others who scored a ride.
In 1971, at the NFR held in <a href="Oklahoma%20City">Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</a>, V-61 was ridden for a qualified ride by <a href="Bobby%20Berger">Bobby Berger</a>, who made the requisite eight seconds and scored 79 points. Berger won the round due to that ride. Bill Nelson drew the bull in the 10th round and bucked off.

In May of 1972, Andy Taylor drew V-61. At this time, the dirt happened to be very deep in the arena. When the dirt is like this, it can be tough on roughstock to buck really well. So Taylor came out of the chute, and he rode V-61. He then fanned the bull with his hat. Minick confessed it made him angry. He told Taylor, "As good as that bull has been for this business, you didn’t have to do that!" Minick thought Taylor's supercilious gesture weakened V-61's career as a top ranked and unridable bull.

In 1972, at the NFR, John Dodd drew V-61 in the first round, and V-61 bucked him off. In the sixth round, hall of famer <a href="Phil%20Lyne">Phil Lyne</a> drew V-61 and made a qualified ride for 70 points.

The last ride.
Minick had thought to retire V-61 after the 1972 NFR. However, Bob Watt, who ran the <a href="Southwestern%20Exposition%20and%20Livestock%20Show">Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo</a>, asked Minick to buck him one last time before retiring him. Minick acquiesced. Upon the draw, Andy Taylor had drawn V-61. Minick took care of V-61 to be sure he was loosened up. Minick said, "I was on the chutes, and when V-61 bucked Taylor off, I threw my hat out across the arena." In January of 1974, Minick retired V-61 after his performance in Fort Worth.

V-61 completed his career with 930 attempted rides that contained only five qualified rides. John Quintana rode him two times. Bobby Berger, Phil Lyne, and Andy Taylor each rode him once. Bulls with buck-off records of this type are rare.

Retirement and honors.
V-61 did not get to enjoy his retirement long, as he died later in 1974. After his death, Minick had his head <a href="taxidermy">mounted</a>. He also had hide containing the V-61 brand from his left hip saved, and he framed it. The mounted head hung in <a href="Billy%20Bob%27s%20Texas">Billy Bob's Texas</a> for many years. Later Minick had it moved to his ranch, and placed it in his log cabin home in <a href="Roanoke%2C%20Texas">Roanoke, Texas</a>, mounted above the awards and the brand. As Minick said, “Every stock contractor wants to have one great one, and V-61 was mine.”

In 1996, the Gladewater Round-Up Rodeo committee, who routinely honors rodeo notables, gave Minick silver spurs to honor V-61. Then, in 2010, they gave Minick the original white chute gate #3, with the statistics of the ride "Quintana vs. V61, 94 points" branded on it. Minick displayed the chute at <a href="Billy%20Bob%27s%20Texas">Billy Bob's Texas</a> for many years. It is now on display at the Bull Riding Hall of Fame in the <a href="Cowtown%20Coliseum">Cowtown Coliseum</a> in the <a href="Fort%20Worth%20Stockyards">Fort Worth Stockyards</a> in <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a>. The Bull Riding Hall of Fame started inducting honorees in 2015. In June each year, the chute is returned to the rodeo in Gladewater, Texas, for display. The Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame inducted V-61 in 2012. The Bull Riding Hall of Fame inducted V-61 in their inaugural class in 2015. Bud Yale of Fort Worth, Texas, who always tied the flank strap on the bull, related that V-61 always left the chutes quickly. "He would sense when the gate was about to open and would draw up and get ready to make that big jump out." Yale said. "When the gate opened, he'd bale out of there and kick like you wouldn't believe."

Minick owns scrapbooks containing clippings and art of V-61, including a photograph of the bull jumping approximately four feet off the ground with Myrtis Dightman riding him.

<doc id="54756119" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54756119" title="Polluter pays amendment">
Polluter pays amendment

In 2003, an amendment was passed negating the "polluter pays" provision of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Florida">Florida Constitution</a>. The original provision required those in the <a href="Everglades%20Agricultural%20Area">Everglades Agricultural Area</a> (EAA) who cause water pollution to be responsible for paying the costs of that pollution's abatement. The Supreme Court concluded that the provision requires "implementing legislation"; the Legislature has not adopted statutes implementing the provision, instead forcing taxpayers to pay 66% of the costs of dealing with contamination in the Everglades.

A study commissioned by the <a href="Everglades%20Foundation">Everglades Foundation</a> found that the agricultural industry is responsible for 76 percent of phosphorus contamination in the Everglades (the rest being urban runoff and wastewater), yet pays only 24 percent of the cost of dealing with it. This is despite Florida's polluter pays amendment requiring the polluters themselves to be "primarily responsible" for cleanup of the wetlands.

History.
The <a href="Everglades%20Forever%20Act">Everglades Forever Act</a> was passed in 1994 as an effort to restore the state's struggling wetlands. In 1996, nearly 70% of Floridians voted to approve the polluter pays amendment to the Constitution. The amendment stated: "Those in the Everglades Agricultural Area who cause water pollution within the Everglades Protection Area or the Everglades Agricultural Area shall be primarily responsible for paying the costs of the abatement of that pollution." Sugar farming occurs on approximately 450,000 acres of the EAA.

Florida's attorney general Robert A. Butterworth stated in 1996 that "while the Legislature may enact provisions implementing Amendment #5, the amendment itself establishes an obligation on polluters of the Everglades to pay the costs of abating such pollution irrespective of legislative action". However, in 2003, the Supreme Court deemed the provision "not self-executing and required implementing legislation". No such legislation has been implemented.

Tonya Bolden

Tonya Bolden (born March 1, 1959) is an American writer best known for her works of children’s literature, especially children’s nonfiction.  

Bolden has authored, co-authored, collaborated on, or edited more than forty books. <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> praised her 1998 book "33 Things Every Girl Should Know" in a speech at Seneca Falls, N.Y. on the 150 anniversary of the first <a href="Seneca%20Falls%20Convention">Women’s Rights Convention</a>. "Maritcha: A Nineteenth-Century American Girl" (2005), her children’s biography of Maritcha Rémond Lyons, was the James Madison Book Award Winner and one of four honor books for the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a>’s <a href="Coretta%20Scott%20King%20Author%20Award">Coretta Scott King Author Award</a>.  "M.L.K.: Journey of a King" (2007) won the <a href="Orbis%20Pictus%20Award">Orbis Pictus award</a> from the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Teachers%20of%20English">National Council of Teachers of English</a>, the organization’s highest award for children’s nonfiction, and the next year, her "George Washington Carver" (2008) was one of five honor books for the same award.  In 2016, the Children’s Book Guild of Washington, D.C. selected Bolden for its Nonfiction Award in recognition of her entire body of work, which, according to the award, has “contributed significantly to the quality of nonfiction for children.”.

Life and Career.
Early Years.
Tonya Bolden was born on March 1, 1959 in New York City to Willie J. and Georgia C. Bolden, who had moved to New York from North Carolina and South Carolina, respectively.  Georgia received formal education only through sixth grade, Willie through ninth.  However, both were firmly dedicated to providing as many educational opportunities as possible to Tonya and her sister Nelta.  Although her parents were careful with money, they were generous when it came to buying books, and Bolden specifically recalls that “whenever I came home with the list of books I wanted to buy at the Arrow Club book fair, they never, ever denied me.”

Although Bolden has claimed that her love of writing while in her parents’ home influenced her eventual choice of career, her parents’ habit of encouraging reading had as much to do with her personal joy as it did her eventual professional prospects.  Her parents, she recalls, “encouraged me to seek to earn a living doing something I absolutely loved. And when I was a child, I was crazy about reading and writing.”.  Indeed, Bolden has said that she has “been in love with books since I learned my ABCs” (Trussell).

Ironically, although Bolden is today best known for her historical fiction and nonfiction, as a child she was pointedly uninterested in history, especially in history learned through books.  “It was usually presented in such an uninteresting way,” she recalls. “I didn’t see myself or my people in history.”  Even when her uncle, whom she describes as “a history freak,” tried to introduce her to black history in Harlem, she often found herself thinking, “I don’t care.”  A rare exception was that she enjoyed the "Little House on the Prairie" television program, though today she suspects that she probably enjoyed it “for the props” or its “old-timey” aspects.

Education.
Bolden’s early education was also marked by her parents’ firm investment in her growth.  Although her mother had no personal experience with quality education in New York, she did extensive research to learn where her daughter could get the best education (Maher 40).  Bolden attended M.E.S. 146, a public school in East Harlem, and later the <a href="Chapin%20School">Chapin School</a>, a private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Bolden has credited excellent teaching at both of these schools with influencing her growth as a writer and desire to publish.

After graduating from the Chapin School, Bolden attended <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, where, in 1981, she completed an undergraduate degree in Slavic Languages and Literature, with an emphasis on Russian. , 

Following her graduation from Princeton, Bolden worked for two years before returning to school.  She then continued her studies at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia</a>.  Bolden has suggested that, along with the multicultural setting of her childhood, her study of Russian in higher education deeply influenced her writing.  She completed her M.A. in 1985, again in Slavic Languages and Literatures with a concentration in Russian.

Early Career.
Following her graduation, Bolden taught at both Malcolm-King College and the <a href="College%20of%20New%20Rochelle">College of New Rochelle</a>.  Her responsibilities included English courses, and she has mentioned that “the course I taught the most was TEE (Translating Experience into Essay). Many of my students were my age or older.  They were living proof that it’s never too late to learn.”

Although she intended to earn a doctorate and become a professor of Russian literature, it was while in graduate school that Bolden’s work began appearing in print, at first mainly through freelance projects, notably in "<a href="Black%20Enterprise">Black Enterprise</a>" magazine.  In 1987, Bolden began writing full-time, putting her in a position in which, as she later recalls, “I "could not" be picky.  I do not think I ever turned down any writing jobs no matter how small or seemingly insignificant.”

Bolden’s first major book project, a young adult novel adaptation of <a href="Vy%20Higginsen">Vy Higginsen</a>’s musical "<a href="Mama%2C%20I%20Want%20to%20Sing%21%20%28musical%29">Mama, I Want to Sing</a>", was published in 1992 by <a href="Scholastic%20Corporation">Scholastic</a>.  Bolden has argued that this opportunity came about in part because of the work she had put in on smaller pieces and in part good fortune.  She says, “Marie Brown, my agent at the time, pitched me to Vy Higginsen and to Scholastic,” and the experience went so well that “the editor talked about my doing another book for her.”  Thus, she remembers, “writing for the young found me and I found myself loving it more and more.”

Themes.
Central to the overwhelming majority of Bolden’s writing is an awareness of identity and the role that books can play in the formation and revision of identity.  In a 2014 essay entitled “All the Children Need All the Books,” Bolden borrows a set of terms from Rudine Sims Bishop to argue that We, who truly care about the future of this nation, we who truly want our youngsters to be their best selves, we absolutely must become more involved in the campaign for all children to have "mirrors"—books in which they see themselves—and for all children to have "windows"—books through which they learn about people who do not look like them, speak as they do, or worship as they do—people who do not share their cultural norms.Children’s books in general are important to this process, she argues, but she has stated elsewhere that nonfiction, especially historical nonfiction, is especially key to such a project.  “What I came to understand as an adult,” she explains, “is that there is power in the past. Knowing history can be a powerful antidote to shame/self-hatred/identity-confusion.”

A subset of the theme of the importance of identity in her work is a specifically black experience of history. She explains:I write because I am the beneficiary of the prayers, hopes, and labors of generations, of people I never knew who braved water cannons, police dogs, burning crosses on lawns, so that I might have wider opportunities.  How can I not contribute?            I write because my parents, born poor and into the world of Jim Crow, seeded in me a love of reading and for school and for learning and for striving for excellence. And indeed, as Bolden explains elsewhere, The fact that all but one of my young adult books are black-themed is not coincidental.  Yes, all young adults can benefit from books about black history and culture; however, it is imperative that black youth read stories and histories about <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and the <a href="African%20diaspora">African diaspora</a>.  I’ll never forget what a psychologist told me years ago:  At about the age of four or five most African American children begin to wonder why the world does not like them.  One way, and my "main" way to prevent this wondering from festering into self-loathing is to create books that definitively speak to black youth, books that teach them, that celebrate their history, their  existence, their potential.  Of course, I am far from alone on this mission. Although not nearly as widespread in her work, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> is also a common theme, especially within the context of <a href="Black%20church">Black American</a> experiences.  In an interview with "BlackandChristian.com," Bolden notes that The <a href="Black%20church">Black Church</a> has influenced me in a number of ways. In terms of history, it helped my people survive and build-up.  In terms of my writing, the music of the Black Church (from the <a href="Spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a> to <a href="Gospel%20music">gospel</a>) and the tones and rhythms of classic black preaching have become part of my “vocabulary.” It's hard to articulate and even pinpoint, but I know that my style of writing has been influenced by the culture of the Black Church.That sensibility manifests in many of her books, and Bolden has identified two books in particular in which readers can and, Bolden feels, should see the influence of Christianity. When discussing her 2001 book "Rock of Ages:  A Tribute to the Black Church", Bolden argued that “People shouldn't have to wait until they are 20 or 30 to learn about the significance of the Black Church.”  Elsewhere, she has confided that she “took a risk” in the way that she wrote her 2006 book "M.L.K.: Journey of a King" by emphasizing the role of the “supernatural” in <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">King’s</a> life:  “many people prefer a King who is not so much of a Christian,” she explains. 

Papers.
One box of Bolden’s papers (consisting of production materials for three of her books) has been donated to the Kerlan Collection at the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota%20Libraries">University of Minnesota Libraries</a>.

In 2016, Bolden received the Nonfiction Award for Body of Work from the Children’s Book Guild of Washington, DC.

Mathews</a> supplied a brief analysis of the language, describing what he called the Tyattyalla dialect of the Wotjobaluk around <a href="Lake%20Albacutya">Albacutya</a> He stated that it was characterized by <a href="Grammatical%20number">four numbers</a>: the singular, the <a href="Dual%20%28grammatical%20number%29">dual</a>, <a href="Grammatical%20number%23Trial">trial</a>, and <a href="plural">plural</a>. There were, in addition, two forms of the trial number for the <a href="Grammatical%20person">Ist person</a>, depending on whether the person addressed was included or excluded. Thus one obtains:"wutju"(a man); 'wutju-buliñ' (two men); "wutju-kullik" (three men); "wutju-getyaul" (several men).

Country.
Wotjobaluk territory took in some inclusive of the <a href="Wimmera%20River">Wimmera River</a>, Outlet Creek and the two <a href="eutrophic">eutrophic</a> lakes, <a href="Lake%20Hindmarsh">Hindmarsh</a> and <a href="Lake%20Albacutya">Albacutya</a>.

Social organization.
The Wotjobaluk were divided into 11 <a href="Band%20society">hordes</a>:

Hunting lore.
Wotjobaluk hunters told <a href="Ebenezer%20Mission">Adolf Hartmann</a> that kangaroos had acute hearing, and could twig the presence of a predator at 150 yards simply by hearing the noise of ankle-bones cracking.

23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism

23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism is a <a href="non-fiction">non-fiction</a> book by economist <a href="Ha-Joon%20Chang">Ha-Joon Chang</a>. It was published on September 1, 2011 by <a href="Penguin%20%28publisher%29">Penguin</a>. The book offers a twenty-three point rebuttal of aspects of <a href="neo-liberal">neo-liberal</a> <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a>.

Summary.
Chang wrote 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism in the aftermath of the <a href="2008%20financial%20crisis">2008 financial crisis</a> which he argues exemplifies his criticism of <a href="globalisation">globalisation</a> and <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a>.

The book's criticisms range from more commonplace assertions such as "companies should not be run in the interests of their owners" to less common specific arguments such as "the washing machine has changed the world more than the internet has".

After listing the twenty-three criticisms, Chang concludes in a section called "How to rebuild the world economy". He advocates a system of capitalism in which the government has a higher degree of control over the economy and wariness towards the <a href="neo-liberal">neo-liberal</a> version of capitalism with minimal government involvement which he argues caused the <a href="2008%20financial%20crisis">2008 financial crisis</a>.

Reception.
The book was generally well-received by critics. John Gray of <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> said in his review that it "masterfully debunked the myths of capitalism", while Ian Fletcher of the <a href="Huffington%20Post">Huffington Post</a> described it as "spot-on" while pointing out that the book supports neither right-wing nor left-wing economic policies and will "offend" both <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> and <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>.

Sean O'Grady of <a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a> argues that "23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism" is testament to the ability of economically poorer nations becoming more powerful over time. Writing in the <a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>, James Crabtree describes the points of Chang's rebuttal as ranging from "conventional left-wing claims" to "counter-intuitive ones" and highlights the close relationship between the rebuttal points and criticisms following the <a href="2008%20financial%20crisis">2008 financial crisis</a>.

However, James Hannam, writing in the <a href="Huffington%20Post">Huffington Post</a>, re-visited the book three years after its publication and commented that many of the aspects Chang attacks are "<a href="Straw-man">straw-men</a>", such as the claim that we do not have a free market due to the restriction of slavery, which Hannam criticises as a misrepresentation of capitalist claims because very few capitalists argue for a completely free market. Hannam summarises that the most valuable aspect of the book is its "insight into how left wing economists are trying to come to terms with the failure of socialism".

<a href="Business%20Insider">Business Insider</a>'s review of the book, written by Hannah Kim and Gregory White, argues that while Chang criticises the flaws of capitalism, he accepts that a modified version with more oversight is the best economic system.

<doc id="54756614" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54756614" title="Jean-Martin Wendel">
Jean-Martin Wendel

Jean-Martin Wendel (22 February 1665 – 25 June 1737) was a <a href="Lorraine">Lorraine</a> industrialist, founder of the <a href="De%20Wendel%20family">De Wendel</a> steel making dynasty.

Origins.
The name "Wendel" is Flemish, from the verb "wenden" (turn).
The <a href="de%20Wendel%20family">de Wendel family</a> can be traced back to Jean Wendel of <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, who married Marie de Wanderve around 1600.
His son was Jean-Georges Wendel, born on 8 October 1605 in <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>, who married Marguerite de Hammerstein and became colonel of a regiment of Cravattes (Croatians) under the <a href="Ferdinand%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Ferdinand III</a>.
His son Christian Wendel was born on 23 April 1636 in Koblenz, and became a lieutenant in the army of <a href="Charles%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Lorraine">Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine</a>.
In 1656 he married Dorothea Agnes Jacob, and in 1660 remarried, to Claire de Sansfeild.
She was from an old family of the Duchy of Luxembourg.
They had six daughters and three sons.
The sons were Francois Wendel, who died on 23 February 1742 without heirs, Jean-Martin Wendel (1665-1737), who founded the industrial fortune of the family, and Jean-Baptiste Wendel, an advocate at the Parliament of Metz in 1721.

Life.
Jean-Martin Wendel was born on 22 February 1665 in <a href="Longlaville">Longlaville</a>, a domain that his mother brought as her dowry.
His father owned several fiefs in Lorraine which he passed to Martin Wendel.
Around 1700 Martin married Anne-Marie Meyer.
His wife was the daughter of a wealthy "fermier" (presumably a tax collector rather than a farmer).
Before 1704 Wendel directed a forge at <a href="Ottange">Ottange</a>, just north of Hayange.

Martin Wendel used his wife's money to buy the iron forge of Hayange from King <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a>.
He paid 9,621 livres on 26 March 1704 for the works at <a href="Hayange">Hayange</a>.
This was a significant amount of money since at the time time a skilled craftsman would earn about 200 livres per year.
The property included the Rodolphe forge, which had been created by Rodolphe de la Roche, the Magdelaine furnace, a hammer mill and a cutting mill.
The mills were incomplete and the other equipment was in disrepair.
Two years earlier the works had been sold for 1,500 livres to Louis de Ridouet-Sancé, who probably invested about 9,000 livres but failed to make the business profitable.
Wendell had to borrow about 30,000 livres from banks in <a href="Metz">Metz</a> and <a href="Thionville">Thionville</a> to invest in the business.

The only commercial activities allowed to noblemen at the time were operating a forge, shipbuilding and glass making.
A forge was an attractive option since it came with a title of nobility.
The king used the sale of rights to operate forges as a source of revenue.
Martin Wendel became Martin de Wendel, seigneur d'Hayange, with the purchase.
In 1709 he requested cession of the Morelle forge, which was ruined, since the owner Benoît de Malzy had failed to pay his feudal dues to Wendel as seigneur of Hayange.
Acquisition of this forge was confirmed by 1711.
On 17 November 1711 he purchased the position of King's Counselor in the Chancellery of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Metz">Parliament of Metz</a>.
This confirmed his position as a minor noble.

Martin Wendel bought land, particularly woodland as a source of charcoal for the forges, and had five furnaces in operation by 1720.
Around 1720 he rebuilt the Hayange chateau.
For most of the 18th century the forge sold all its output to the royal artillery works in Thionville.
The <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> caused high demand for iron to make weapons.
Jean-Martin Wendel's acquisition of the Rodolphe forge marked the transition from artisan manufacture to industrialization.
Exploiting local supplies of iron and wood, Wendel and his son Charles built Hayange into the largest iron enterprise in Lorraine in the eighteenth century.

Martin Wendel was granted letters patent dated 17 February 1727 in <a href="Lun%C3%A9ville">Lunéville</a> by <a href="Leopold%2C%20Duke%20of%20Lorraine">Leopold, Duke of Lorraine</a>.
The letters patent confirmed his nobility independent of the forges, but noted that the nobility could not be formally proved since the titles had been "lost in the misfortune of war".
Martin Wendel died on 25 June 1737, and his wife died on 12 September 1740.
By the time Wendel died the value of the business was estimated at 700,000 livres.
His son, François Ignace de Wendel, fought for protectionist tariffs on finished metal, combined with no taxes on import of raw material.
Martin Wendel was followed by eight generations of steelmakers.

Kastoria's first run of 2006 saw her made odds-on favourite, ahead of the <a href="Mooresbridge%20Stakes">Mooresbridge Stakes</a> winner Cairdeas in the Listed Vintage Crop Stakes at <a href="Navan%20Racecourse">Navan Racecourse</a> on 30 April. After racing in fifth place she made steady progress in the straight, went to the front with a furlong and a half left to run and won by a length from her stablemate Virginia Woolf. In May she started favourite for the <a href="Yorkshire%20Cup%20%28horse%20race%29">Yorkshire Cup</a> but finished fourth of the seven runners behind the five-year-old <a href="gelding">gelding</a> Percussionist. On 1 July the mare started 9/4 favourite for the Curragh Cup ahead of <a href="Collier%20Hill">Collier Hill</a> and Mkuzi, a seven-year-old gelding who had won the race for the last two years. After being restrained by Kinane at the rear of the seven-runner field she stayed on strongly in the straight took the lead inside the final furlong and held off the late challenge of Collier Hill to win by a head.

After a break of almost seven weeks, Kastoria returned in the Listed <a href="Ballyroan%20Stakes">Ballyroan Stakes</a> over one and a half miles at <a href="Leopardstown%20Racecourse">Leopardstown Racecourse</a>. Starting the 4/5 favourite she raced in second behind the British-trained Foreign Affairs (winner of the <a href="Goodwood%20Cup">Goodwood Cup</a>) before taking the lead a furlong out and drawing away to win by three lengths. John Oxx commented "She's a lovely mare and I wish we could have one of her every year. She dosses a bit in front but hopefully she will step up again from this".

The Group 1 Irish St Leger at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh</a> on 16 September saw the 2005 winner <a href="Yeats%20%28horse%29">Yeats</a> start the 2/7 favourite with Kastoria next in the betting on 6/1. The other six runners included Percussionist, The Whistling Teal (<a href="St%20Simon%20Stakes">St Simon Stakes</a>, <a href="Chester%20Cup">Chester Cup</a>) and Fracas (<a href="Derrinstown%20Stud%20Derby%20Trial">Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial</a>). Kinane settled the mare in fourth place behind Percussionist, Yeats and Fracas in the early stages before making a forward move entering the straight by which point Yeats had gone to the front. Kastoria moved up alongside the favourite approaching the final furlong and got the better of Yeats to win by half a length. The pair finished ten lengths clear of the other runners, who were headed by The Whistling Teal. After the race Oxx said "I thought we would run Yeats close as her homework has been terrific lately. She's the type of filly who always has a bit in the tank and needs a good horse to take her along. She's had a very good season and just seems to have improved a bit. She keeps pulling out a bit more when she's got a target to follow. She loves to have a target to attack at the end and when she gets to the front she pricks her ears and doesn't do a lot".

In October Kastoria was sent to Canada where she started favourite for the <a href="Canadian%20International%20Stakes">Pattison Canadian International</a> at <a href="Woodbine%20Racetrack">Woodbine Racetrack</a> but finished eighth of the ten runners behind Collier Hill. For her final racecourse appearance, the mare was shipped to Hong Kong to contest the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Vase">Hong Kong Vase</a> at <a href="Sha%20Tin%20Racecourse">Sha Tin Racecourse</a> on 10 December. After being badly hampered and dropping back to last place entering the straight she produced a very strong finish and appeared to be an unlucky loser as she failed by a nose to overhaul Collier Hill.

Breeding record.
Kastoria was retired from racing to become a broodmare for the Aga Khan's stud. She produced five foals and two winners:


In November 2013 Katoria was offered for sale at Goffs and bought for €100,000 Kirsten Rausing's Lanwades Stud.

<doc id="54757113" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54757113" title="Treaty of Detroit (1855)">
Treaty of Detroit (1855)

The Treaty of Detroit of 1855 was a treaty between the United States Government and the <a href="Odawa">Ottawa</a> and <a href="Ojibwe">Chippewa Nations</a> of Indians of Michigan. The treaty contained provisions to allot individual tracts of land to Native people consisting of plots for single individuals and plots for families, outlined specific tracts which were assigned to the various bands and provided for the severance of the government consolidation of the Ottawa and Chippewa.

Terms.
The first eight provisions of the treaty outlined specific township locations which were assigned to the six bands comprising the <a href="Sault%20Tribe%20of%20Chippewa%20Indians">Sault Ste. Marie Chippewa</a>; the bands living north of the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a>; the bands residing on <a href="Beaver%20Island%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">Beaver Island</a>, <a href="Garden%20Island%20%28Michigan%29">Garden Island</a> and <a href="High%20Island%20%28Michigan%29">High Island</a>; the bands located in <a href="Bear%20Creek%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Bear Creek</a>, <a href="Cross%20Village%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Cross Village</a>, <a href="L%27Arbre%20Croche">L'Arbre Croche</a> and <a href="Readmond%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Middle Village</a>; the <a href="Grand%20Traverse%20Band%20of%20Ottawa%20and%20Chippewa%20Indians">Grand Traverse Band</a>; the bands living along <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a>; the bands located at <a href="Cheboygan%2C%20Michigan">Cheboygan</a>; and the bands residing around <a href="Thunder%20Bay%20%28Michigan%29">Thunder Bay</a>.

Allotments of the townships were to include for each single person and for each head of a family unit (including families composed of widows and orphans). To determine eligibility, a roll was to be created by the Indian agent. All lands would be issued a patent in the holder's name, though no title would be issued for a period of 10 years. Restrictions on title prohibited selling or transferring any of the allotted holdings during the 10-year period. Should the Indian agent deem the recipient incapable of managing their own affairs after the waiting period, all transfers could remain banned indefinitely. There were further provisions to exempt missions, churches,schools and settlers already residing within the described tracts from being removed, as well as provisions for unallotted land to revert to <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a> if not distributed within five years.

Provisions were made for agricultural and educational training, as well as providing payment to establish such facilities. While requiring signatories to release and discharge the United States from liabilities resulting from any previous treaty obligations, the agreement specified that the "right of fishing and encampment secured to the Chippewas of Sault Ste. Marie by the treaty of June 16, 1820," would remain. An additional provision stated that the combined organization of Ottawa and Chippewa was dissolved and that any future negotiations with the United States, except for the 1855 treaty, would be arranged without a general convention of the two peoples.

Impact.
The treaty became the basis for numerous lawsuits against the federal government in the 20th century. One of the first was the <a href="Indian%20Claims%20Commission">land claim</a> of the <a href="Northern%20Michigan%20Ottawa%20Association">Northern Michigan Ottawa Association</a> (NMOA), filed in 1948 by <a href="Waunetta%20McClellan%20Dominic">Waunetta</a> and <a href="Robert%20Dominic">Robert Dominic</a>. Other suits followed, primarily because settlement of the judgement won could not be distributed, as there were no tribal governments to whom the award could be distributed. Bureaucrats of the government determined that the language of the treaty in effect terminated the tribes, though <a href="Vine%20Deloria%20Jr.">Vine Deloria Jr.</a> argued that the meaning of the treaty was instead to disassociate the arbitrary grouping the government had formed by placing the Ottawa and Chippewa into a single negotiating entity. Because the treaty provided for continued negotiation by the bands, it was a recognition that the distinct tribal units would negotiate on behalf of their own political units and no longer act as a single entity.

Because low-level bureaucrats determined that the language <a href="Indian%20termination%20policy">severed the tribal governments</a>, tribes were forced to attempt to gain re-affirmation as distinct, self-governing nations. Two groups which had previously been consolidated with other bands reorganized in the 1970s: the <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20Tribe%20of%20Chippewa%20Indians">Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians</a> regained recognition in 1972 and the <a href="Lac%20Vieux%20Desert%20Band%20of%20Lake%20Superior%20Chippewa%20Indians">Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians</a> reorganized in 1970 and re-recognized in 1988. Six of the bands were reaffirmed after the land claim was awarded, including the <a href="Grand%20Traverse%20Band%20of%20Ottawa%20and%20Chippewa%20Indians">Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians</a> in 1980, the <a href="Little%20Traverse%20Bay%20Bands%20of%20Odawa%20Indians">Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians</a> and the <a href="Little%20River%20Band%20of%20Ottawa%20Indians">Little River Band of Ottawa Indians</a> in 1994, the <a href="Pokagon%20Band%20of%20Potawatomi%20Indians">Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians</a> in 1994, the <a href="Nottawaseppi%20Huron%20Band%20of%20Potawatomi">Nottawaseppi Huron Band of Potawatomi</a> in 1995, and the <a href="Match-e-be-nash-she-wish%20Band%20of%20Pottawatomi%20Indians%20of%20Michigan">Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan</a> (also known as the Gunlake band) in 1995. Three of the bands whose members were signatories to the treaty have not been reaffirmed by the federal government. They include the <a href="Burt%20Lake%20Band%20of%20Ottawa%20and%20Chippewa%20Indians">Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians</a> (also historically known as the Cheboiganing Band), the <a href="Grand%20River%20Band%20of%20Ottawa%20Indians">Grand River Band of Ottawa Indians</a> and the <a href="Swan%20Creek%20Black%20River%20Confederated%20Ojibwa%20Tribes%20of%20Michigan">Swan Creek Black River Confederated Ojibwa Tribes of Michigan</a>, each of which is recognized by the state of Michigan.

Finally in 1997, the federal government made a mechanism to distribute the award which had been held in trust since 1972. Disputed fishing claims have continued to be an issue, as have ownership of the lands awarded by the treaty, the right to tax those lands and which governing authority sets legal codes for people living upon the lands. In 2016, a case involving the treaty provisions was filed by the Little Traverse Bay Band over whether the assignment of specific townships to specific bands in the 1855 treaty constituted the establishment of a tribal reserve.

Sunsets For Somebody Else

Sunsets For Somebody Else is a song by <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="singer-songwriter">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="Jack%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Jack Johnson</a>. The song is the second single from the album <a href="All%20the%20Light%20Above%20It%20Too">All the Light Above It Too</a>, and was released on August 3, 2017.

Composition.
Johnson wrote this song while he was on a surf trip in <a href="Micronesia">Micronesia</a>, and says "Something about being on boats always pulls songs out of me." Billboard says that Johnson's lines such as, "You tell yourself just to turn away/but you know you've already lost" and "I know I've seen that vacant stare/selling sunsets for somebody else" have a soothing tinge unlike other Johnson songs. Other lines such as ""You find yourself looking up at night, from the bottom of the earth"" are supposed to caputure the listener, and make them feel like they are on a beach on a hot summer day. The recording displays a very big instrumentation of the music he recorded that launched his career in 1999. The song is one of three songs to be released prior to the album, along with <a href="My%20Mind%20Is%20for%20Sale">"My Mind Is for Sale"</a>.

Release.
The song was first released exclusively through <a href="Billboard%20charts">Billboard</a> in the morning of August 3, 2017, but later in the day was available for download on <a href="ITunes%20Store">ITunes</a>, and to all who pre-ordered the album. A CD single for the song was released on August 17, 2017.

Music Video.
A music video is yet to be released for the song, but Johnson did release an official audio on his <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a> channel.

Jugendkulturhaus Dynamo

' (), also known as the ' is a <a href="youth%20center">youth center</a> in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. The space hosts workshops, concerts, and plays. It also includes a restaurant and club.

History.
 The Drahtschmidli opened as a <a href="spa">spa</a> on the <a href="Limmat">Limmat</a> in 1772. When he inherited it, Wilhelm Reiser turned the spa into a brewery. After a series of accidents and mishaps which caused the brewery to pass from owner to owner, the explosions during the construction of the <a href="Letten%20Tunnel">Letten Tunnel</a> led to cloudy beer and the city of Zurich took over the factory in 1906 (the customer list was purchased by the nearby <a href="H%C3%BCrlimann%20Brewery">Hürlimann Brewery</a>).

In the 1930's the idea of a <a href="youth%20hostel">youth hostel</a> led to the Department of Vacation and Freetime () of Zürich. They wanted to create a space with club rooms, craft rooms, workshops, a large multi-purpose room with a stage, and office space for the VFF. Because of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the money could not be allocated until the late 1950's. To raise money to build the necessary accommodations, the Zurich Youth House () raised 700,000 francs through three summer festivals. They announced they would use the money to build a new facility. Construction did not occur, and the city chose to renovate the current space instead, but had to deal with a group of 60 adolescents who kept renting out the spaces. The space closed down soon after, citing drug problems.

Dynamo.
By the 1980's, the youths of Zürich were upset about not having their own youth center. When the <a href="Z%C3%BCrich%20Opera%20House">Zürich Opera House</a> received a grant of for renovation, the youths took to the streets. The riots led to the creation of the Autonomous Youth Center in <a href="Lindenhof">Lindenhof</a> () and the <a href="Rote%20Fabrik">Rote Fabrik</a>. The Autonomes Jugendzentrum closed quickly, and was promptly demolished, again leaving the youth of Zürich with no center. In 1982, the city budgeted 15 million francs to extend the Drahtschmidlis, renaming it the Dynamo.

The Dynamo opened in May 1988 with the goal of "providing youths with a free space to develop themselves and assume responsibility". At first the Dynamo only offered <a href="boarding%20house">boarding house</a> services, hosted events, and taught courses, but quickly expanded to include a <a href="metalworking">metalworking</a> shop, <a href="graphic%20design">graphic design</a> workshop, <a href="recording%20studio">recording studio</a>, sound laboratory, and restaurant. During this time, the Dynamo also held many classes taught by the <a href="F%2BF%20School%20for%20Art%20and%20Media%20Design%20Zurich">F+F School for Art and Media Design Zurich</a>. The nearby <a href="Platzspitz%20park">Platzspitz park</a>, a hotspot for heroin users, closed in 1992, causing the drug users to relocate to the <a href="Z%C3%BCrich%20Letten%20railway%20station">Zürich Letten railway station</a>, right in front of the Dynamo. Still the number of visitors continued to grow, and in 1996 about 100,000 adolescents visited the Dynamo. 

In 2017, the rivalry between <a href="Grasshopper%20Club%20Z%C3%BCrich">Grasshopper Club Zürich</a> and <a href="FC%20Z%C3%BCrich">FC Zürich</a> led to several Grasshopper Club fans being beaten with in the Dynamo.

The Dustbowl Revival

The Dustbowl Revival are an 8-piece <a href="Americana">Americana</a> Soul band from Venice, California with four studio albums out and a full-time tour schedule of 200 days per year on the road. 

Biography.
Critics have proclaimed that this eclectic eight-piece “would have sounded utterly at home within the hallowed confines of Preservation Hall in New Orleans' French Quarter” and their “upbeat, old-school, All-American sonic safaris exemplify everything shows should be: hot, spontaneous, engaging and, best of all, a pleasure to hear” Rob Sheffield, in <a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>, hailed them as a great band “whose Americana swing was so fun I went back to see them again the next day.”

2017 marks the tenth anniversary of The Dustbowl Revival’s formation. It was back in 2007 when Zach Lupetin, a Midwestern transplant to Los Angeles, posted an ad on <a href="Craigslist">Craigslist</a> in hopes of creating a group inspired by brass band and string band traditions. Over the years, the group has been an inclusive outfit that frequently shifted in size before solidifying in its current eight-piece lineup.

History.
In 2008, Zach Lupetin and The Dustbowl Revival released their debut album, "The Atomic Mushroom Cloud of Love". They followed up in 2010 with "You Can’t Go Back to the Garden of Eden", which included "Dan's Jam,” a song that won the Independent Music Awards’ “Americana Song of the Year.” The next year, the band, now known just as The Dustbowl Revival, put out "Holy Ghost" EP and their 2013 "Carry Me Home" CD featured more than 25 Dustbowl Revival-ists. That was also the year the L.A. Weekly crowned them the city’s “Best Live Band.”

In 2015 The Dustbowl Revival signed to Northampton, MA-based record label <a href="Signature%20Sounds%20Recordings">Signature Sounds Recordings</a> who are best known for <a href="Lake%20Street%20Dive">Lake Street Dive</a>. The video for “Never Had To Go,” starring band fan <a href="Dick%20Van%20Dyke">Dick Van Dyke</a>, went viral, garnering over 4 million views on its official YouTube video. In 2017 a clip of the band and Dick Van Dyke from the music video was featured in the HBO documentary “If You’re Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast” also starring <a href="Jerry%20Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a> and <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a>. The group went on to open for bands ranging from Lake Street Dive to the <a href="Preservation%20Hall%20Jazz%20Band">Preservation Hall Jazz Band</a>, while also appearing at such festivals as Delfest, Floydfest, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, Norway’s Bergenfest and Denmark’s Tonder Festival. 
In 2017 the band teamed up with <a href="Flogging%20Molly">Flogging Molly</a> founding member and Grammy Award winning producer <a href="Ted%20Hutt">Ted Hutt</a> to produce their fourth studio album as this eight-piece unit. The album was released on June 16, 2017 with featured guest <a href="Keb%E2%80%99%20Mo%E2%80%99">Keb’ Mo’</a> and debuted in the Top 25 on two Billboard charts: Billboard Americana-Folk and Billboard Heatseekers. The band’s sound evolved into Americana Soul and was described by Elmore Magazine as an "energizing Americana with a shot of soul, funk and roots-infused rock that evokes the work of Fleetwood Mac, Paul Simon, Aretha Franklin and classic Stax recordings, and yet fits the band alongside such contemporaries as Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats and St. Paul & the Broken Bones.”



Critical Acclaim.
"A nine-piece band replete with tuba, washboard, accordion, fiddle, mandolin, trumpet and guitar joyously pumped out early 20th century standards and original tunes that would have sounded utterly at home within the hallowed confines of Preservation Hall in New Orleans' French Quarter. The seven men, most with suspenders attached to well-worn trousers, broad ties and vests and some sporting 1930s-vintage newsboy caps, and two women in flapper-inspired dresses, are members of a ragtag outfit called the Dustbowl Revival, strumming, sawing and puffing enthusiastically as smiling listeners on the dance floor swung their partners infectiously." – Los Angeles Times 

"The music is so genuine, you can almost taste the PBR and port wine being passed around the front porch during the Great Depression on the bayou, or on the post-fire Chicago streets. Trumpets blaze, guitars wail, and the spirit of a great revival becomes you." – Train Wreck’d Society 

"A natural opening act for The Lumineers or Mumford and Sons.” – Los Angeles Magazine

“Big-boned, gangly R&B with arms a tangle of woody roots, the music and singing on their self-titled fifth album absolutely startles the senses.” - Tahoe Onstage

"Bright Stax-style horns now punctuate the songs’ rhythms and add an element that’s likely to bring show audiences to their feet….Some tunes make you smile every time you roll into them—and that’s kind of what this one does for us—it’s like a shot of sexy adrenaline.” —POPMATTERS

"It's hard not to be in a good mood while taking in the "new-wave jug-band" and its delightful cacophony of fiddles, ukeleles, tubas, washboards and kazoos.” —Time Out Los Angeles

"I had never heard of this California-based roots-rock ensemble, but having been given their most recent release, The Dustbowl Revival, I feel like I’ve been given entrée into a delightful new world, one where the sounds of Americana past meets up with contemporary music and has one roaring all-night dance party.” —The Recoup

"An absolutely perfect melding of funk, country, ska, and rock and roll. This album runs the spectrum when it comes to categories. So do we call it country? Americana? rhythm and blues? It is all of the above, but none of the above, in aggregate. Something new was created here. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention a fantastic trombone solo on Good Egg (Track 3). The best trombone solo since A Cave from <a href="The%20Mighty%20Mighty%20Bosstones">The Mighty Mighty Bosstones</a> on their debut album "The Devil’s Night Out" from way back in 1989!"

Alfa Romeo A15

Alfa Romeo A15 / A19 / A38 / F20 were lorries produced by Alfa Romeo .

The models originated from the collaboration between Alfa Romeo and <a href="Saviem">Saviem</a> (part of the <a href="Renault">Renault</a> group), which was signed in 1967. The collaboration had begun earlier when Renault and Alfa Romeo produced <a href="Renault%20R4">R4</a> and <a href="Renault%20Dauphine">Dauphines</a> in Italy.

The trucks that were produced following this agreement were similar to <a href="Renault%20Super%20Go%C3%A9lette">Saviem SG2</a> (A15/A19) and <a href="Saviem%20Super%20Galion">SG4</a> (A38) models. Around 3,500 units of A15, A38, A19 and F20 were produced in the <a href="Alfa%20Romeo%20Pomigliano%20d%27Arco%20plant">Pomigliano d'Arco plant</a> near Naples before 1974. The Alfa Romeo naming of lorries or vans reflected the production options chosen by the customer. This comprised a letter followed by two digits: A for "Autocarro" (truck) or F for "Furgone" (van), followed by a number referring to the payload (expressed in quintals, as is the usual practice in Italy).

All models are equipped exclusively with Alfa Romeo-Saviem diesel engines type 599 developing of with a <a href="MAN%20SE">MAN</a>-licensed direct injection. Saviem did not want this engine and insisted on mounting its own diesel engine which developed only , a level of power which was deemed insufficient in comparison to competing Italian vehicles. This engine was subsequently installed in French models from 1967.

A15.
The A15 model had a full load of 3.5 tons and was equipped with a 4-cylinder <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel</a> engine of and at 3200 rpm. Four years after launch the displacement was updated to , which allowed the vehicle to reach a maximum speed of . The A15 had a payload of up to .

A19.
The A19 model had a full load of 3.9 tons and had mounted a 4-cylinder diesel engine of and at 3200 rpm. Four years after launch the displacement was updated 3,319 cc. This allowed the vehicle to reach a maximum speed of . The A19 had a payload of up to .

A38.
The A38, with its 6.3 tons full load, was available with several <a href="chassis">chassis</a> (including a shielded autotelaio and a bus chassis), which were characterized by having different steps. It was also available in an <a href="all-wheel%20drive">all-wheel drive</a> variant. The A39 had a 4-cylinder diesel engine of by , which allowed the vehicle to reach a maximum speed of . Four years after its initial launch, the cylinder was brought to . In the standard truck version, the payload was . The A38 was available in several variants: a basic A38, an A38/L1 wheelbase, and an A38/L2 <a href="wheelbase">wheelbase</a>.

In 1970 the round headlights were replaced by oval headlights. At the same time, the Alfa Romeo A38 became A38n, an advanced model.

The four-wheel drive version was developed in collaboration with the company <a href="Man%20Meccanica">Man Meccanica</a> on the basis of an Alfa Romeo A19, an adaptation almost identical to that carried out in France by <a href="Sinpar%20TP3">Sinpar TP3</a> (also Saviem TP3).

F20.
The Alfa Romeo F20 was presented at the <a href="Turin%20Auto%20Show">Turin 1967</a> as a prototype and produced from 1969. It was born out of a collaboration agreement between <a href="Alfa%20Romeo">Alfa Romeo</a> and <a href="Saviem">Saviem</a> signed in 1967.

The F20 had a full load of 4.3 tons, a 4-cylinder diesel engine of and at 3200 rpm; Then the displacement was brought to . The F20 had a payload of . The F20 was offered as a paneled van with sliding side door, another with side doors on each side, and a final version without any side door. A chassis-bare version was also offered to bodybuilders for further declinations.

Production end.
Alfa Romeo-Saviem production ended in 1974, and the Alfa Romeo vans AR40 and AR80 were not produced until 1978, when they were rebadged <a href="Iveco%20Daily">Iveco Daily</a>. This was a second commercial failure. Two reasons for this failure are that the vehicles had underpowered engines for Italy's topography, and had payloads which were too low. High royalty prices far above customs duties were also a factor.

Renault-Saviem reacted reasonably, and the French group sought technical cooperation with Fiat and Alfa Romeo, with whom they signed an agreement on September 13, 1974 for the creation of a joint venture (<a href="Sofim">Sofim</a> - "Société Franco Italienne de Moteurs"). The aim of this venture was to design and manufacture fast and powerful new-cylinder engines. The new factory was built in the municipality of <a href="Foggia">Foggia</a> in the south of Italy. Each manufacturer contributed 33.33% of the capital. The first engines—released in 1977—gave the factory an excellent reputation. They were named the Sofim 8140, with a displacement of developing and were used in many vehicles, cars and utilities of the three brands.

Leda and the Swan (Correggio)

Leda and the Swan is an oil on canvas painting from 1530-1531 by the Italian painter <a href="Correggio">Correggio</a>, now in the <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie">Gemäldegalerie</a> in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. It shows three scenes of <a href="Leda%20%28mythology%29">Leda</a>'s seduction by <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> who has taken the form of a swan. Their first meeting is shown on the right hand side and their lovemaking in the centre, where Leda sits with the swan between her thighs, guiding him with her left hand. They are accompanied to their left by Cupid with his bow and two cupids with flutes. The third scene (again on the right hand side) is the swan flying away whilst Leda gets dressed. <a href="Leda%20and%20the%20Swan">Leda and the Swan</a> was a common subject in 16th-century art.

History.
Correggio conceived a series of works entitled "Amori di Giove" or "Love Affairs of Jupiter" after the success of "<a href="Venus%20and%20Cupid%20with%20a%20Satyr">Venus and Cupid with a Satyr</a>". The series eventually consisted of two pairs of works, each pair having the same dimensions, though he may have planned for there to be more. The precise order of the four works is still debated, though their main importance lies in their contribution to the development of secular and mythological painting via its new and extraordinary balance between naturalist rendering and poetic transfiguration. Correggio had made a study of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s "<a href="Leda%20and%20the%20Swan%20%28Michelangelo%29">Leda and the Swan</a>".

According to <a href="Vasari">Vasari</a>'s "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Artists">Lives of the Artists</a>", the "Leda" and a "Venus" (ie "<a href="Dana%C3%AB%20%28Correggio%29">Danaë</a>") were commissioned by <a href="Federico%20II%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua</a> as a gift for <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. This is supported by the theory that Jupiter was flying out of the right hand side of "Leda" in swan form and into the left hand side of "Danaë" in golden-shower form. However, one more recent study suggests that all the paintings in the "amori di Giove" series were produced for the "Sala di Ovidio" (<a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> Room) in <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> (meant for the duke's lover <a href="Isabella%20Boschetti">Isabella Boschetti</a>) and only moved to Spain after Federico II's death in 1540, perhaps on the infante <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip</a>'s marriage to <a href="Maria%20Manuela%2C%20Princess%20of%20Portugal">Maria Emanuela d'Aviz</a> (<a href="1543">1543</a>).

In 1598 the painting was still in the Spanish royal collections - it and "<a href="Ganymede%20Abducted%20by%20the%20Eagle">Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle</a>" were both acquired that year by <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Rudolf II</a> and taken to <a href="Prague">Prague</a>. The paintings' later owners were similar to those of "Danaë" - it moved to Sweden during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%20War">Thirty Years War</a> and <a href="Christina%20of%20Sweden">Christina of Sweden</a> gave it to cardinal <a href="Decio%20Azzolini">Decio Azzolini</a>; it was later in the famous <a href="Orleans%20Collection">Orleans Collection</a> owned by <a href="Philippe%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Philippe II, Duke of Orléans</a>. However, his devout son <a href="Louis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans%20%281703%E2%80%931752%29">Louis</a> found the painting too licentious and attacked it with a knife, irreparably damaging Leda's face.

What was left of the painting was given to <a href="Charles-Antoine%20Coypel">Charles-Antoine Coypel</a>, first painter to the king, who painted a replacement head. Still in pieces, the painting was sold in 1753 to the collector Pasquier, who commissioned the painter <a href="Jacques-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Delyen">Jacques-François Delyen</a> to paint a new replacement head - in 1755 the count of Epinaille bought it on behalf of <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a>, who hung it in his summer palace of <a href="Sanssouci">Sanssouci</a>. It was confiscated by Napoleon and restored again by <a href="Pierre-Paul%20Prud%27hon">Pierre-Paul Prud'hon</a> before being returned to Germany in 1814 and placed in the Berlin museums in 1830 - there <a href="Jakob%20Schlesinger">Jakob Schlesinger</a> painted a third replacement for Leda's head. However, the 1604 copy shows that even this restoration censored Correggio's original composition, giving Leda a chaste rather than orgasmic expression and removing the backwards twist of her head that Correggio had originally intended (similar to that of Io in his "<a href="Jupiter%20and%20Io">Jupiter and Io</a>").

List of Valencia CF Femenino seasons

This is a list of seasons played by <a href="Valencia%20CF%20Femenino">Valencia CF Femenino</a>, the women's section of <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="association%20football">football</a> club <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia CF</a>, and its predecessor DSV Colegio Alemán. The team was created in its original form in 1998, and has represented Valencia CF since the 2009–10 season. 

Season-by-season.
2013–2014.
After <a href="Amadeo%20Salvo">Amadeo Salvo</a> became Valencia CF's new chairman the club invested in the women's team, which had struggled to avoid relegation in previous seasons, and it became one of the leading teams in Spain for the next years. In the first season of this new era Valencia ended sixth in the league, tied at points with the two upper positions, the best position in its history back then. Thus it made its second appearance in the Copa de la Reina, where it was knocked out in the quarterfinals. 




2014–2015.
Valencia ended the league in the fourth position, improving the previous season's 6th position. Despite a slump in the championship's final weeks, the team recovered and reached the Copa de la Reina's final in its third appearance in the competition, but lost it. Remarkably, three of the four defeats of <a href="FC%20Barcelona%20Femen%C3%AD">Barcelona</a> in the 2014–2015 national campaign were against Valencia.




2015–2016.
Valencia ended the league campaign as sixth, two positions below the previous season, despite scoring eleven more goals. In the Copa de la Reina it reached the semifinals, where it was defeated by <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20Femenino">Atlético Madrid</a> after extra time.




2016–2017.
In its best league campaign yet, Valencia ended in the table's top-3 for the first time, seven points away from Champions League qualification. It was the least scored team in the championship with 11 goals against, and <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Paz%20Vilas">Maripaz Vilas</a> was the third top scorer with 28 goals. On April 23, the team played for the first time in the club's main venue, <a href="Mestalla%20Stadium">Mestalla</a>, in a derby-record 6–0 victory over <a href="Levante%20UD%20Femenino">Levante</a> with an attendance of 17,000. In the national cup Valencia reached the semifinals, where it was defeated by <a href="FC%20Barcelona%20Femenino">Barcelona</a>.

Leda and the Swan (Michelangelo)

Leda and the Swan is a lost tempera on canvas painting by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, produced in 1530 but now only surviving in copies and variants.

History.
In 1512 <a href="Alfonso%20I%20d%27Este%2C%20Duke%20of%20Ferrara">Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara</a> went to Rome to reconcile with <a href="Pope%20Julius%20II">Pope Julius II</a>, who had excommunicated him in summer 1510 for his alliance with <a href="Louis%20XII%20of%20France">Louis XII of France</a> against the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a>. Julius absolved him and Alfonso spent a few days in Rome before returning to Ferrara. On 11 July he visited the <a href="Sistine%20Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a>, where Michelangelo was completing the <a href="Sistine%20Chapel%20Ceiling">ceiling</a>. As he climbed the scaffolding he had a long and admiring conversation with Michelangelo, who promised him a painting.

Several years passed without the commission being formalised until Michelangelo had to be in Ferrara in 1529 to inspect its city walls as "governor general of fortifications" for the Florentine Republic, ready for an expected Imperial siege. On that occasion the Duke held Michelangelo to his promise and according to Condivi and <a href="Vasari">Vasari</a> he produced the work when he returned to Florence in August 1530 after the city's fall, perhaps using the time he had to spend in hiding. It was a square work in tempera, representing Jupiter as a swan making love to a reclining <a href="Leda%20%28mythology%29">Leda</a> (based on an composition from ancient Roman gems and seals), an egg and <a href="Castor%20and%20Pollux">Castor and Pollux</a> as children.

It was completed by mid-October 1540 but Alfonso described it as a "little thing" in Michelangelo's hearing and so he refused to hand it over. The work and some of the preparatory drawings were in fact acquired (either as a purchase or a gift) by <a href="Antonio%20Mini">Antonio Mini</a>, who took it to France in 1531. In 1532 he left it to <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a>, who later sent it to the <a href="Palace%20of%20Fontainebleau">Palace of Fontainebleau</a>. The best known copy is attributed to <a href="Rosso%20Fiorentino">Rosso Fiorentino</a> and hangs in the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> in London, with others in the <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%20%28Dresden%29">Gemäldegalerie (Dresden)</a>, the <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%20%28Berlin%29">Gemäldegalerie (Berlin)</a> and the <a href="Correr%20Museum">Correr Museum</a> in Venice. The <a href="Casa%20Buonarroti">Casa Buonarroti</a> in Florence holds not only a copy but also a preparatory drawing of Leda's head, held to be by Michelangelo himself. There are also several prints of the work, the most faithful of which is thought to be the one by <a href="Nicolas%20B%C3%A9atrizet">Nicolas Béatrizet</a>, which also shows Castor and Pollux.

Doina (Eminescu)

Doina, or Doină (sometimes translated as "Lament"), is a <a href="political%20poem">political poem</a> by the Romanian <a href="Mihai%20Eminescu">Mihai Eminescu</a>. It was first published in <a href="1883%20in%20literature">1883</a> and is therefore seen by some as Eminescu's final work in verse, although it may actually be an 1870s piece, inspired or enhanced by the perceived injustice of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berlin%20%281878%29">Berlin Treaty</a>. A variation of the "<a href="doina">doina</a>" (plural: "doine"), picked up from <a href="Romanian%20folklore">Romanian folklore</a>, it is noticeably angry to the point of rhetorical violence, a radical expression of <a href="Romanian%20nationalism">Romanian nationalism</a> against invading "foreigners", noted for its hints of <a href="ecopoetry">ecopoetry</a> and "<a href="Technophobia">anti-technicist</a>" discourse. "Doina" delineates the ideal geographical space of <a href="Greater%20Romania">Greater Romania</a>, at a time when Romanian-inhabited regions were divided between an <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">independent kingdom</a> and multinational empires. Its final lines call on <a href="Stephen%20III%20of%20Moldavia">Stephen the Great</a>, depicted as a <a href="sleeping%20hero">sleeping hero</a>, to take up the cause of Romanians and chase foreigners out with the sound of his horn. The same basic themes appear in another poem by Eminescu, the anthem-like "La arme" ("To Arms"), which is sometimes discussed as a variant of "Doina".

Expressly <a href="Anti-Russian%20sentiment">anti-Russian</a>, also read as <a href="antisemitic">antisemitic</a>, <a href="Anti-German%20sentiment">anti-German</a>, <a href="Anti-Greek%20sentiment">anti-Greek</a>, <a href="Anti-Hungarian%20sentiment">anti-Hungarian</a>, and <a href="Anti-Ukrainian%20sentiment">anti-Ukrainian</a>, "Doina" has been described as "chauvinistic" and "minor" by some critics, "beautiful" by others. It has been present in the <a href="Education%20in%20Romania">Romanian curriculum</a> since the 1890s, while also serving as subversive literature among Romanian communities in the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. During the interwar, with Greater Romania established as a political reality, "Doina" became a rallying call for revolutionary nationalists and fascists. It was deemed problematic and <a href="Censorship%20in%20Communist%20Romania">censored</a> during the <a href="Communist%20Romania">communist period</a>, although tacitly endorsed under the regime's latter, <a href="National%20communism%20in%20Romania">national-communist</a>, phase. It returned in focus during the <a href="Romanian%20Revolution%20of%201989">Romanian Revolution of 1989</a> and after, when it also became a public symbol of Romanian identity in <a href="Moldova">Moldova</a>.

Outline.
"Doina" opens with a localization of the Romanian space, highlighting regions which were at the time in Russia and <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>:
Eminescu moves focus on <a href="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a>, depicted as raided by ""<a href="Moskal">muscali</a>"" on horseback; on <a href="Bukovina">Bukovina</a>, with foreigners as "caterpillars" and stalkers of the local Romanians; then on <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, crossed by the foreigners' "inroads". Overall, the projected country is aflush with intruders and the Romanian is a "foreigner in his own land"; birds are chased away, songs are extinguished, and the forest, "brother of the Romanian", is depleted. The description of this desolate landscape ends in imprecation:
The ending of "Doina" is Eminescu's contribution to a "trans-historical" cult of Prince Stephen:

Background.
A poet as well as a folklorist, Eminescu was well acquainted with the traditional forms of Romanian poetry, and wrote several poems in folkloric style—his Transylvanian enemy, <a href="Alexandru%20Grama">Alexandru Grama</a>, could therefore claim that Eminescu had simply plagiarized Transylvanian "doine". As noted by Eminescu expert <a href="Perpessicius">Perpessicius</a>, one of his first published works, taken up by "<a href="Familia%20%28magazine%29">Familia</a>" in the 1860s, was a "type of "<a href="doina">doina</a>"" or a "pseudo-"doina"". Another variation on that pattern is addressed to "His Majesty, The Forest" ("Codrule, Măria ta"), with the poet asking to be turned into a tree branch, rocking into eternal slumber. Seen by scholars as an early draft of "Doina", it was described as "hollow" and "rudimentary" by critic Constanța Marinescu. However, according to Călinescu, such works sound less "gauche" than actual folk poetry, as polished for print by <a href="Vasile%20Alecsandri">Vasile Alecsandri</a>. Contrarily, Perpessicius asserts that Eminescu was less talented that Alecsandri, never matching his work as a folklorist or folklore-inspired versifier. According to scholar Marin Bucur, Marinescu is essentially wrong in treating the draft as an actual poem, and also in failing to see why "Doina" itself is a worthy piece. 

Eminescu's interest in "doine" only peaked after 1877, when he was living as a journalist in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, and began systematic readings from collections of folk poetry. They were integrated into a vast fund of drafts and versions for "Doina", which, as noted by Perpessicius, cannot realistically be published together as a critical instrument. In its final form, "Doina" is popularly associated with the unveiling at <a href="Ia%C8%99i">Iași</a> in June 1883, of a monument to Prince Stephen. Eminescu was by then erratic and fatigued, displaying, already from May 1883, the early stages of a mental breakdown. Lodging with <a href="Ion%20Creang%C4%83">Ion Creangă</a> in Iași, he shocked his old friend by brandishing a revolver, explained by the poet as a defense against unspecified enemies. He never actually attended the unveiling of Stephen's statue, only showing up for parallel ceremonies at "<a href="Junimea">Junimea</a>" society. It was there that he first read his "Doina", on June 4. The audience was reportedly enthusiastic, and moved in to hug Eminescu. "Doina" was first published by the "Junimist" monthly "<a href="Convorbiri%20Literare">Convorbiri Literare</a>" on July 1.

An emotional Creangă later claimed that his friend had written the poem over those few days, at Creangă's own home, the peasant-style "<a href="Ion%20Creang%C4%83%20Memorial%20House%2C%20Ia%C8%99i">Bojdeuca</a>". Scholar <a href="Dumitru%20Caracostea">Dumitru Caracostea</a> similarly believes that "Doina" is the last of Eminescu's poems, composed just before "his collapse in 1883". This is contradicted by other accounts. Researcher D. Murărașu believes that Eminescu had actually completed the poem 13 years before, while present at Putna for Prince Stephen's commemoration, and merely reused it for the 1883 feast. 

Eminescu expert Dumitru Irimia groups "Doina" and "<a href="Luceaf%C4%83rul%20%28poem%29">Luceafărul</a>" into Eminescu's "final effort". He proposes that Eminescu, sensing his "mental equilibrium" slipping away, concentrated on finishing up both works, which outline his universal and social queries. However, he dates the earliest recognizable drafts of "Doina" to 1878, and Eminescu's anger over the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berlin%20%281878%29">Berlin Treaty</a>, which awarded the <a href="Budjak">Budjak</a> to Russia, noting parallels with the author's political columns, taken up by "<a href="Timpul">Timpul</a>" in the early 1880s. According to Perpessicius, while the poem's references to rail transport may correspond to the unraveling of the <a href="Strousberg%20Affair">Strousberg Affair</a>, "Doina" is the product of 1878, written "a day after [the Budjak's] cession [...], five years before the celebrations in Iași". He believes that "Doina" was in any event completed in December 1882, which was the original date set for the inauguration of Stephen's statue.

Themes.
Xenophobia debate.
Himself a nationalist, <a href="Nicolae%20Iorga">Nicolae Iorga</a> described the piece as both "beautiful" and "political", marked by Eminescu's "hatred of an unrelenting foreign invasion". Without endorsing the political message, critic <a href="Nicolae%20Manolescu">Nicolae Manolescu</a> also found Eminescu's piece aesthetically pleasing. Other commentators disagree with these verdicts. Constantin Coroiu describes "Doina" as "not a masterpiece, not even a small one", while <a href="Z.%20Ornea">Z. Ornea</a> includes it among Eminescu's lesser poems, a "modest work in verse". Essayist <a href="Nicolae%20Steinhardt">Nicolae Steinhardt</a> took an intermediary position. While he recognized "Doina" as inferior to Eminescu's <a href="philosophical%20poetry">philosophical poetry</a>, he proposed that the verse still had "beauty bubbling like <a href="geyser">geyser</a>s", the beauty of "<a href="Thracians">Thracian</a> rocks collapsing".

Grama, who saw himself as a fellow nationalist, accused Eminescu of insincerity, noting that the message of "Doina" contrasted first and foremost with Eminescu's own recourse to "cosmopolitan" themes in his other work. Also according to Grama, the "idiotic" poet wrote apocalyptic verse at a time when Romanians' fates were actually improving. This verdict is not shared by other commentators. In 1934, critic <a href="Mihail%20Dragomirescu">Mihail Dragomirescu</a> argued that "Doina" and "<a href="Scrisoarea%20III">Scrisoarea III</a>" contained Eminescu's "innermost thoughts", which led to <a href="Simion%20B%C4%83rnu%C8%9Biu">Simion Bărnuțiu</a>, "Romanianism", and "national mysticism". Caracostea defines the poem as an "excruciating ethnic elegy", and a sample of the "liveliest indignation"—reserved by Eminescu for politics and social commentary. According to scholar <a href="Lucian%20Boia">Lucian Boia</a>, Eminescu's poetry is overall the best expression "anti-cosmopolitan" drive in Romanian nationalism. Boia sees "Doina" as sketching out Eminescu's "dream": "a pure Romanian civilization, untouched by foreign influences and still less by the effective presence of foreigners." Irimia notes the work for "absolutely confound[ing]" the poetic self with national identity, "taking on the historical being of the Romanians [and] harmonizing it with with the sacred dimension of the universal being." According to musicologist Carmen Manea, both "Doina" and "Scrisoarea III" resemble in intent <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a>'s "<a href="Polonaise">Polonaise</a>s".
The poem is one of "national revival", looking forward to a <a href="Greater%20Romania">Greater Romania</a> comprising all the Romanian-inhabited regions and, as argued by comparatist Călin-Andrei Mihăilescu, is "explosive" in "deplor[ing] the alienation of Romanians in their own lands". Literary historian John Neubauer notes "Doina"s "chauvinistic remarks", while Bernard Camboulives refers to its "notes of xenophobia", stemming from a "growing intellectual despair". These, Camboulives notes, "might shock those readers who are unfamiliar with Romanian history". 

The opening lines vaguely mention "foreigners", but the portion may refer to the situation in Eminescu's own Bukovina, specifically to relatively recent presence there of Germans, Ukrainians, and especially <a href="Bukovina%20Jews">Bukovina Jews</a>. According to scholar Petru Zugun, there is nothing specifically xenophobic or antisemitic about "Doina", whose introductory portion is simply a critique of "unproductive foreigners", some of whom happened to be Jews, into Bukovina. Zugun further argues that Eminescu was even more critical of his co-nationals, when these were unproductive. Manolescu acknowledges that background is xenophobic, targeting Russians, Jews and <a href="Hungarians%20in%20Romania">Hungarians</a>. However, he argues that the poem, unlike Eminescu's articles, can be appreciated without such "sociological" hints. Critic <a href="Alex.%20%C8%98tef%C4%83nescu">Alex. Ștefănescu</a> explains "Doina" as "sentimental, not ideological", to be understood as a declaration of love to Romania. He also notes that Eminescu was writing after "century-long dramas" provoked by "foreign occupations or by foreigners peacefully infiltrated, but never really integrated, into Romanian society, never giving up on their ethnic solidarity." As noted by culture critic <a href="Garabet%20Ibr%C4%83ileanu">Garabet Ibrăileanu</a>, Eminescu was a xenophobe who, overall, preferred the Jews to the <a href="Liberalism%20and%20radicalism%20in%20Romania">Romanian liberals</a>, viewing the former as more honest and reliable. 

Literary historian <a href="Leon%20Volovici">Leon Volovici</a> also sees Eminescu as guided by an economic theory, but notes his vision of an "objective conflict" between Romanians and foreigners, including in particular Jews (<a href="Jewish%20assimilation">assimilated</a> or not) and <a href="Greeks%20of%20Romania">Greeks</a>; the "apocalyptic" "Doina" formed part of that discourse. <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Romania">Romania's Jews</a>, Eminescu insisted, were most removed from the authentically Romanian peasantry, and therefore "could not merge with our people." Draft versions of the poem make explicit mention of "Stephen's Romanians" being "in kike hands", and record with alarm the spread of <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> in Bukovina. Another manuscript proclaims specific curses against the perceived enablers of Jews, Greeks, and Russians, for instance:
The Bukovina themes had appeared in several Eminescu "doine", notably including an 1877 stanza in which Eminescu, or his peasant inspiration, describes the region at "the mercy of the foreigner, which is like a thistle's shadow". The latter metaphor is also found in "Doina", suggesting "the image of poverty sweeping over the country [...]. In times of drought, the thistle's shadow is more desolate than no shadow at all, a mock-offering to the heat-stricken people." A specific reference to the village of <a href="Boiany">Boian</a>, in "Doina"s ninth line, has contributed to that locality's notoriety in a Romanian cultural context. Another discernible issue is anger over the plight of Romanians in Russia's <a href="Bessarabia%20Governorate">Bessarabia Governorate</a>, which included the Budjak. As noted by Irimia, the two occupations appear as a continuum in Eminescu's lyrical universe. The Bessarabian topic is addressed in a parallel poem, referring the the Russians as "<a href="Cynocephaly">dog-headed</a>" and "dog-hearted" <a href="Kalmyks">Kalmyks</a>, likely to "tear out the tongues" of Romanian-speakers. The early versions of "Doina" still made mentions of "<a href="Tatars">Tatar</a> and Kalmyk hordes". Also from the period, "La arme" ("To Arms"), sometimes seen as a "Doina" variant, urges Romanians to answer the call of "gentle Bessarabia", "our younger sister", "awaiting to be murdered by dogs".

Traditionalism and biblical echoes.
According to Steinhardt, the central message is not xenophobic, but "ecological", "<a href="Technophobia">anti-technicist</a>", and "obviously <a href="Heideggerian">Heideggerian</a>", its violence being Eminescu's attempt to fend off an "ancient curse". This reading refers in particular to a line which mentions the "iron road" (the <a href="Imperial%20Royal%20Austrian%20State%20Railways">Austrian rail company</a>) bringing in foreigners to "kill all the songs", as well as to the claim that the forest and the Romanian are like "brothers". The same lines are also highlighted by critic <a href="Barbu%20Cioculescu">Barbu Cioculescu</a>: "That Eminescu was our first environmentalist is an established fact, beyond all debate [...]. The construction of railways across the country's virgin plains, centenary forests, and murmuring waters drove him to despair". Ștefănescu rejects literal readings of the "iron road" verse, noting that Eminescu stood not for an aversion to progress, but rather against the "brutal destruction of a slowly emerging harmony", an "irreversible destruction of beautiful things." Trains have first appeared as instruments of corruption in <a href="Bogdan%20Petriceicu%20Hasdeu">Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu</a>'s "Iron Road" (1864), which exegets such as Liviu Marian saw as "quasi-identical" with the passage in "Doina", and which is primarily about the Strousberg scandal.

Several commentators focus on the poem's prophetic outbursts and their literary sources. Some see "Doina" as primarily a curse, similar to <a href="Basil%20of%20Caesarea">Saint Basil</a>'s exorcism or to the <a href="Kosovo%20curse">Kosovo curse</a>, in the <a href="Vuk%20Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87">Vuk Karadžić</a> version. As noted by Ștefănescu, Eminescu changes the meaning of words, turning the mere fondness of strangers into a punishable crime: "[He] can make words into soft twigs, sketching on the surface of water, and also into daggers." Al. Andriescu, the Biblical scholar, argued that the central themes, of national perdition and redemption, are echoes of the "<a href="Psalms">Psalms</a>", arriving at Eminescu through his readings from <a href="Dosoftei">Dosoftei</a>. Building on this verdict, Ukrainian researcher Volodymyr Antofiychuk proposes that "Doina" is a parallel to <a href="Taras%20Shevchenko">Taras Shevchenko</a>'s own psalmodic verse. Both authors, Antofiychuk notes, invoked the Bible specifically against Russian expansionism. 

Although rejecting Eminescu's overall contribution, including most of "Doina", Grama reserved praise for this final scene, calling it a "masterpiece", when viewed separately: "most Romanians cannot fail to be moved" by it. Comparatist <a href="Grete%20Tartler">Grete Tartler</a> proposes that the "famous invocation" deepens folkloric accounts about Stephen as a <a href="sleeping%20hero">sleeping hero</a>, on par with <a href="Ogier%20the%20Dane">Ogier the Dane</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Barbarossa">Frederick Barbarossa</a>. Camboulives explains his presence in these lines as an appeal to Stephen's standing as a powerful enemy of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, and defender of "the whole of Christendom." Similarly, Ștefănescu argues that Eminescu appealed primarily to the "Romanian mythology", of Stephen as an "unvanquished hero".

Legacy.
Becoming a symbol.
"Doina" was included by <a href="Titu%20Maiorescu">Titu Maiorescu</a> in his first-ever critical edition of Eminescu's poems, published at <a href="Editura%20Socec">Editura Socec</a> as the author had withdrawn from public life. The "classic" selection and arrangement, which place "Doina" right before "<a href="One%20Wish%20Alone%20Have%20I">One Wish Alone Have I</a>", were praised by Perpessicius as particularly tactful. Nevertheless, critics were flummoxed by Maiorescu's apparent carelessness, which, in poems such as "Doina", proliferated known typos. The Socec collection is known for missing an entire line of the poem, alluding to the foreigners' reliance on the "iron road". The corrected version of "Doina" was published in February 1884 by Maiorescu's rivals at "<a href="Contemporanul">Contemporanul</a>". Socec itself amended the text in its revised edition of 1895. "La arme" remained unpublished until 1902, but was widely known through its musical adaptation by <a href="Eduard%20Caudella">Eduard Caudella</a>, which is probably from 1883. Caudella himself believed that the work was a suitable anthem, "the Romanians' "<a href="Marseillaise">Marseillaise</a>"". Another version, circulated in the <a href="Banat">Banat</a> by Liviu Tempea, was sang to the tune of "<a href="Chant%20du%20d%C3%A9part">Chant du départ</a>".

The first use of "Doina" as an object of study in academia was I. Manliu's manual of <a href="poetics">poetics</a>, published in 1890 and heavily indebted to Maiorescu's observations, closely followed in 1893 by <a href="Enea%20Hodo%C8%99">Enea Hodoș</a>'s reader, aimed at Romanian schoolteachers in the Banat, and by Gheorghe Adamescu's <a href="chrestomathy">chrestomathy</a>. In the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Kingdom of Romania</a>, three literature textbooks for schoolchildren included "Doina" before 1900. The poem was also part of the theatrical repertoire, recited during intermissions by <a href="Aristizza%20Romanescu">Aristizza Romanescu</a>. Iorga's associate <a href="A.%20C.%20Cuza">A. C. Cuza</a>, who published in 1914 a "people's edition" of Eminescu's work, set apart a section for the "doine". The cover had art by <a href="Ipolit%20Str%C3%A2mbu">Ipolit Strâmbu</a>, depicting the final scene of "Doina", with Stephen sounding his horn. As noted at the time by Ibrăileanu, nationalism permeated the reading of Eminescu's work: while "Doina" and "Scrisoarea III" could still "serve nationalism", most of his poetry could not. Ibrăileanu argues that this realization prompted <a href="Ilarie%20Chendi">Ilarie Chendi</a> and others to seek the publication of Eminescu's other, lesser and unfinished, prose works. The poem, and especially its reference to the "iron road", was also popular with the socialist "Revista Socială", which saw the old gentry and the peasants as equally threatened by modernization.

By 1900, Eminescu's posthumous followers included <a href="Duiliu%20Zamfirescu">Duiliu Zamfirescu</a>, who wrote a "Doina"-like poem specifically about Bukovina, and the Bukovinan <a href="Radu%20Sbiera">Radu Sbiera</a>. According to Ibrăileanu, the latter, being an "untalented Eminescian", was inspired by "Doina" to the point of plagiarism. In 1902, "Doina" also inspired the critically acclaimed debut of <a href="Octavian%20Goga">Octavian Goga</a>, a Transylvanian. The poem was already an established political symbol, circulated clandestinely in Bessarabia by <a href="Ion%20Pelivan">Ion Pelivan</a>. Pelivan was arrested by the <a href="Special%20Corps%20of%20Gendarmes">Special Corps of Gendarmes</a> in 1903. During the inquiry, Pelivan reports, the Gendarmes produced an incompetent translation of "Doina" into Russian, missing out on its more inflammatory rhetoric. "Doina" was subsequently used as a rallying call in 1912, during the centennial of Bessarabia's annexation by Russia. Its recitation headlined the "festival" organized in Bucharest by the <a href="Cultural%20League%20for%20the%20Unity%20of%20All%20Romanians">Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians</a>. The respite of censorship following the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201905">Russian Revolution of 1905</a> ultimately produced a blossoming of the Romanian Bessarabian press, including "<a href="Cuv%C3%A2nt%20Moldovenesc%20%28magazine%29">Cuvânt Moldovenesc</a>"—which, in 1913, put out an Eminescu selection, featuring both "Doina" and "Codrule, Măria ta". Meanwhile, Volovici notes, Eminescu's rhetoric partook in "exacerbat[ing] the negative image of the foreigner and stimulated xenophobia." As reported by writer <a href="A.%20A.%20Luca">Avram Axelard (A. A. Luca)</a>, "Doina" had also become an anthem for "Christian boys" in Bukovina, who used it as a justification to punch him and other Jews.

In Greater Romania.
Two years after the Cuza edition, the Romanian Kingdom <a href="Treaty%20of%20Bucharest%20%281916%29">entered World War I</a> as an <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Entente country</a>; the alliance favored the Russian Empire over Austria-Hungary, and the cause of Transylvania over that of Bessarabia. During <a href="Romania%20in%20World%20War%20I">the subsequent campaigns</a>. "La arme" was a soldiers' anthem, used for instance during Nerva I. Paul's charge on German positions (October 1916). Nevertheless, Romania contemplated <a href="Treaty%20of%20Bucharest%20%281918%29">defeat in early 1918</a>. Writing at the time in "<a href="Chemarea">Chemarea</a>", the Jewish critic <a href="Benjamin%20Fondane">Benjamin Fondane</a> reminded Iorga and other nationalists of the anti-Russian content of "Doina", which, he argued, had been proven right. 

The following months and years saw the creation and consolidation of Greater Romania, beginning with the <a href="union%20of%20Bessarabia%20with%20Romania">union of Bessarabia with Romania</a>. In interwar Bessarabia, "Doina" continued to have an especially strong presence as a political symbol and poetic model, while "La arme" was quoted as an opening text by the literary review "<a href="Via%C8%9Ba%20Basarabiei">Viața Basarabiei</a>". "Doina" was also a major of influence on the anti-Russian poetry published at the time by <a href="Ion%20Buzdugan">Ion Buzdugan</a>. In contrast, the left-wing <a href="Emilian%20Bucov">Emilian Bucov</a> parodied the poem, revising its central message:
Eminescu's poem had become universally present in literature textbooks, and was for the first time made accessible to the youngest cohorts by the reading aids of <a href="Gheorghe%20Bogdan-Duic%C4%83">Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică</a>. It also influenced sculptor <a href="Ion%20Schmidt-Faur">Ion Schmidt-Faur</a>, who in 1929 added a "Doina"-inspired relief, of Stephen and his horn, at the base of his Eminescu statue in Iași. Before and during and World War II, the work was several times transposed into foreign languages. In 1927, <a href="Ramiro%20Ortiz">Ramiro Ortiz</a> put out an Eminescu reader in Italian, which included "Doina". A Hungarian-language "Doina" was completed by <a href="S%C3%A1ndor%20Kib%C3%A9di">Sándor Kibédi</a> in 1934. The <a href="Czechs%20in%20Romania">Bukovina Czech</a> Božena Șesan published a translation into her native language in 1944. 

From ca. 1927, "Doina" was also especially popular with the <a href="Iron%20Guard">Iron Guard</a>, a fascist movement which similarly "express[ed] the ancestral, somehow atemporal, sense of Romanian purity and solidarity among Romanians" and gave Stephen an "exceptional position" in its propaganda works. The poem was also invoked by the <a href="National%20Christian%20Party">National Christian Party</a>, which shared the Guard's antisemitism and was sometimes allied with it. Its leader was the poet Goga, who used the lyrics to justify crimes committed by the Guard's Captain, <a href="Corneliu%20Zelea%20Codreanu">Corneliu Zelea Codreanu</a>, calling "Doina" a "gospel of Romanianism." The same appropriation happened with "La arme". "Almost confiscated [...] by far-right groups", it reportedly inspired Codreanu to designate the basic Iron Guard cells as "cuiburi" ("nests"). By 1936, <a href="Stelian%20Popescu">Stelian Popescu</a> of the nationalist paper "<a href="Universul">Universul</a>" was reusing the "dogs-eating-hearts" line, in red lettering, against his Jewish and left-wing rivals at "<a href="Adev%C4%83rul">Adevărul</a>", accusing them of being a front for the <a href="Romanian%20Communist%20Party">Romanian Communist Party</a>. As recalled by Cioculescu, during the <a href="National%20Legionary%20State">National Legionary State</a> the same slogan was "plastered all over the walls" of Romanian cities, "as if the Guard didn't have its own foreigners!"

Communist censorship.
In late 1944, shortly after <a href="King%20Michael%27s%20Coup">King Michael's Coup</a> and the onset of <a href="Soviet%20occupation%20of%20Romania">Soviet occupation in Romania</a>, "La arme" was banned. At the time, Iron Guard commandos, supported by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, used "Doina" as a password. Under the subsequent <a href="Communist%20Romania">Romanian communist regime</a>, "Doina" was also targeted by <a href="Censorship%20in%20Communist%20Romania">political censorship</a>: already in 1946, the quotation from "Doina" was removed from Schmidt-Faur's relief. The poem could not be published in Bessarabia, which was included in the Soviet Union as the <a href="Moldavian%20SSR">Moldavian SSR</a>. In both countries, it was "banned and recited only in private readings because it named Russia as one of the imperial powers that had oppressed the Romanian nation." Also uncomfortable were its "strident nationalism" and its mention of the Dniester, "at the time in the territory of the Soviet Union." Philologist <a href="Petru%20Cre%C8%9Bia">Petru Creția</a> also argued that "Doina" upset the communist rulers because they themselves were mostly "foreigners [...], extremely offended by the things one read in there". 

In Western countries, the anti-communist <a href="Romanian%20diaspora">Romanian diaspora</a> still published and discussed the poem. Diaspora journalist <a href="Virgil%20Ierunca">Virgil Ierunca</a> noted at the time that Eminescu was both praised and censored with the acquiescence of a compliant <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>. He highlighted this against the oppression experienced by the other social groups, quoting "Doina"s "all Romanians have complained to me". The poem's nationalist prestige was preserved by the self-exiled Iron Guard poet, <a href="Aron%20Cotru%C8%99">Aron Cotruș</a>, who wrote many pieces which allude to Eminescu's, in both style and intertexual references, updated to refer to communism and the Soviets. 

Dissidents at home also maintained a cult of the poem. As noted by Creția, "Doina" had a psychological appeal: "those who hid it under a bushel were mistaken, with this poem preserving a latent life in the national psyche; thus, the censors, instead of attenuating an obsession, have maintained it." Historian <a href="Zoe%20Petre">Zoe Petre</a> recalls having been taught "Doina" as a youth, "in the summer of '44", which was already a gesture of defiance from her family. One theory claims that the disillusioned communist poet <a href="Nicolae%20Labi%C8%99">Nicolae Labiș</a> openly recited "Doina" at a Bucharest locale in autumn 1956, the sign of his conversion to nationalism—a departure for which he was allegedly assassinated. Reportedly, at around the same time the left-wing <a href="Victor%20Eftimiu">Victor Eftimiu</a> expressed a wish to expunge "Doina" from collective memory, "for its xenophobia". Dumitru Irimia recalls that, in the early 1960s, Eminescu was "la secret" ("under lock and key"), primarily quoted with his "<a href="Emperor%20and%20Proletarian">Emperor and Proletarian</a>", but also that his high school teacher privately advised him to read "Doina". Linguist <a href="Tatiana%20Slama-Cazacu">Tatiana Slama-Cazacu</a> also remembers that volumes containing "Doina" could not be checked out of public libraries. 

The <a href="Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia">Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968</a> brought anti-Russian sentiment to the forefront, allowing <a href="Sabin%20Dr%C4%83goi">Sabin Drăgoi</a> to compose and circulate a second musical version of "La arme". In the 1970s, following the <a href="National%20communism%20in%20Romania">deterioration of contacts</a> between Romania and the Soviet Union, communist leader <a href="Nicolae%20Ceau%C8%99escu">Nicolae Ceaușescu</a> became more lenient toward "Doina". At a Communist-Party plenary meeting early that decade, he reportedly cited the imprecation about dogs "eating the hearts" of xenophiles. In 1976, Ceaușescu proposed to publish a collection of Eminescu's "national" poetry, headlined by "Doina"s apparent claim to Bessarabia. Actor Ludovic Antal was reportedly the first to test censorship by publicly reciting "Doina", at some point before his death in 1979. References to "Doina" were still stripped from the 1977 Romanian edition edition of an Eminescu study, by the Frenchman Alain Guillermou. A French translation was done by Jean-Louis Courriol, but, as Courriol himself recalled, could still not be published in Romania in 1984. At around that time, <a href="Cezar%20Iv%C4%83nescu">Cezar Ivănescu</a> wrote a pastiche of "Doina" with a covert critique of communism; this was detected, then eliminated, by the censors. 

By then, <a href="Adrian%20P%C4%83unescu">Adrian Păunescu</a> of "<a href="Cenaclul%20Flac%C4%83ra">Cenaclul Flacăra</a>" was staging public readings of "Doina" in Romania. Sometimes broadcast by radio, these were also followed by Romanian activists in the Moldavian SSR. There, the poem had remained banned in the <a href="Brezhnev%20Era">Brezhnev Era</a>, with <a href="Nicolae%20Lupan">Nicolae Lupan</a> threatened and ultimately expelled from the country for having circulated it. With the onset of "<a href="Perestroika">Perestroika</a>" reforms in the Soviet republic, the magazine "Nistru" published all versions of "Doina" in its first issue of 1988, an initiative credited to poet <a href="Dumitru%20Matcovschi">Dumitru Matcovschi</a>. From her home in the <a href="Latvian%20SSR">Latvian SSR</a>, Maria Macovei-Briedis published the Romanian magazine "Glasul", which also took up "Doina" in 1988.

Recovery.
At the Eminescu centennial, some eleven months before the <a href="Romanian%20Revolution%20of%201989">Romanian Revolution of 1989</a>, "Doina" was publicly quoted in Ceaușescu's own address. As noted by Slama-Cazacu, the message was read at the <a href="Romanian%20Atheneum">Romanian Atheneum</a> by <a href="Emil%20Bobu">Emil Bobu</a>, who happened to be "one of [Ceaușescu's] least cultured ministers." The issue of "Doina" came up during long debates over the publication of Eminescu's complete works. The project was endorsed by philosopher <a href="Constantin%20Noica">Constantin Noica</a>, who proposed putting out facsimiles from Eminescu's manuscripts. He acknowledged in 1977 that some were problematic for the regime, "xenophobic, anti-Russian", and suggested to "leave "Doina" out of it [...], we'll do it like type-writer girls—this we erase, the rest can appear." In 1989, Ceaușescu ultimately allowed Creția to republish "Doina" in a lithographic edition which reproduced the Maiorescu original. According to Petre, this was originally planned as a regular-type edition, but Creția, who defended the inclusion of "Doina", struggled with censorship for several years. During one episode of this exchange, he proposed changing "from the Dniester to the Tisza" to "from the <a href="Danube">Istros</a> to the Tisza", which excluded reference to Bessarabia; "Dniester" would only be clarified in the <a href="erratum">erratum</a>.

The poem was again fully accessible during the revolutionary events, its opening lines used by the <a href="National%20Salvation%20Front%20%28Romania%29">National Salvation Front</a> in its first appeals to the Iași populace. Also then, actor <a href="Victor%20Rebengiuc">Victor Rebengiuc</a> walked into the <a href="Romanian%20Television">Romanian Television</a> building and recited the poem in a live broadcast, changing stress from its condemnation of foreigners to read like an attack on people associated with the old regime. According to Eminescu expert Cornelia Viziteu, there followed a period of "overtly nationalist" readings with "evidently superficial commentary", including popularization of "Doina" through other television broadcasts. "Doina" was again standard reading for seventh-grade students, a matter which, according to journalist Sorin Șerb, contributes to their cultural isolation: "The Romanian schoolchild doesn't live on Earth, in an universe filled with wonder, but within the borders of a 'national, sovereign, independent, unitary and indivisible state'". In the 1990s, "Doina" was featured on <a href="Romanian%20Orthodox%20icons">Romanian Orthodox icons</a>, by a <a href="Com%C4%83ne%C8%99ti">Comănești</a> priest calling for Eminescu's canonization, and also reclaimed by Iron Guard revivalists. It was then controversially sourced by the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29">Social Democratic</a> politician, <a href="Nicolae%20Bacalba%C8%99a">Nicolae Bacalbașa</a>, during the <a href="Romanian%20presidential%20election%2C%202014">presidential race of 2014</a>, read as an attack on <a href="Klaus%20Iohannis">Klaus Iohannis</a> (who is a <a href="Transylvanian%20Saxons">Transylvanian Saxon</a>). 

Eminescu is also revered in the post-Soviet <a href="Republic%20of%20Moldova">Republic of Moldova</a>, where he has a status equivalent to that of "national poet", within <a href="Controversy%20over%20ethnic%20and%20linguistic%20identity%20in%20Moldova">the larger debate about Moldovan identity</a>. This status is seen by scholar Wim van Meurs as "artificial" and "completely false", in particular because it has to override his Greater Romanian nationalism, "expressed in the first lines of his poem "Doina"". On the "<a href="Moldovenism">Moldovenist</a>" side of the debate, the issue was brought up in the 1990s by author <a href="Ion%20Dru%C8%9B%C4%83">Ion Druță</a>, who suggested that both Eminescu and "Doina" are not representative for the Moldovan ethos, which, he argues, relies on other elements. 

In 1998, Ioana Both noted that "Doina" was instrumented as a slogan by the <a href="Unification%20of%20Romania%20and%20Moldova">Moldova–Romania unionist movement</a>. Writing in 2016, historian <a href="Robert%20D.%20Kaplan">Robert D. Kaplan</a> suggested that its first line continues to be quoted, "with its misty inoperable longing for a Greater Romania." "La arme", in the Caudella version, was also recovered as an anthem by Moldovan unionists in the early 1990s. This issue was highlighted in November 1993, just before <a href="Great%20Union%20Day">Romania's national holiday</a>, when a <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Moldova">Moldovan Supreme Soviet</a> delegate recited "Doina" in <a href="Parliament%20of%20Romania">Parliament</a>. The ambassadors of Hungary and Ukraine left the hall in protest, sparking a debate that also involved intellectuals on either side. At the time, the Hungarian teacher Lajos Ötvös wrote a piece giving contextual justification for "Doina"s rhetoric. In parallel, "Doina" continues to be of interest to Eminescu translators in other neighboring countries, with an Ukrainian version completed by Ivan Kideshuk.

Coliseum Mountain

Coliseum Mountain is a peak north of the town of <a href="Nordegg">Nordegg</a>, <a href="Alberta%2C%20Canada">Alberta, Canada</a>. It is in the David Thompson Country of the <a href="Canadian%20Rockies">Canadian Rockies</a>. It has a summit of 2,035 m (6677 ft). The mountain was named after its amphitheatre bowl shape resembling the <a href="Colosseum">Colosseum</a> of ancient Rome. The <a href="Stoney%20First%20Nations">Stoney First Nations</a> previously named the peak "Yahareskin", meaning “mountain with a cap” because of its bare summit.

History.
Coliseum mountain was first mapped by <a href="Sir%20James%20Hector">Sir James Hector</a> of the <a href="Palliser%20Expedition">Palliser Expedition</a> in 1858. <a href="Martin%20Nordegg">Martin Nordegg</a>, the founder of the coal mining town of Nordegg, climbed the mountain in 1913.

Forestry Rangers went to the top of Coliseum as early as 1914 to scout the land for forest fires. A mountain <a href="fire%20lookout">fire lookout</a> was built on the peak in 1927, when Nordegg was an up and running <a href="coal%20mining">coal mining</a> town. Some residents of Nordegg remember climbing up Coliseum to deliver mail to the ranger stationed in the lookout. 

The lumber was hauled by packhorses to the top of the mountain to build the lookout tower, the first fire lookout in Alberta. Construction was under the supervision of District Forest Ranger Bill Shankland. 
The people of Nordegg claim that the fire lookout ranger during the coal mining days of the 1950s, Leo Letourneau, “passed time by turning his telescope on town activities, the children nicknaming him “Old Leo”. This lookout has since been moved to the top of Baldy Mountain in the 1955, the neighbouring mountain just West of Coliseum.

Hiking.
Coliseum mountain is a popular hike for those traveling to Nordegg and along the <a href="David%20Thompson%20Highway">David Thompson Highway</a>.
The most common way to the summit of Coliseum is up the Coliseum Trail, a 6.5 km trail or a 13 km return hike up a non-motorized switchback trail, gaining 635 metres (2083 ft) of elevation. The Coliseum Trail Staging Area can be accessed by taking the Shunda Creek Road through the Nordegg North Subdivision and following the signed arrows along the road, to Baldy Mountain Road up to Eagle Drive.

The Ridgeline Trail is a longer, more challenging and less used trail to the summit. It is a 7.2 km trip to the peak or a 14.4 km return trip beginning at the Ranger Station, east of the town of Nordegg just off the David Thompson Highway. It climbs the ridge across from the Beaverdam Provincial Recreation Area.

There is also the Ranger Station Trail, beginning at the Ranger Station and following the base of the mountain, eventually connecting with the Coliseum Trail or the Ridgeline Trail.
Some people choose to climb up the front face of the mountain, beginning at the Coliseum Staging Area. However, this trail is challenging and not clearly marked, with difficult scree sections, some scrambling and steep climbs.

Pierre Luboshutz

Pierre Luboshutz (June 17, 1891 - April 17, 1971) was a <a href="Russians">Russian</a> concert <a href="pianist">pianist</a>.

Born in <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, Luboshutz was initially taught to play the <a href="violin">violin</a> by his father. However, he then took up the <a href="piano">piano</a>, and entered the <a href="Moscow%20Conservatory">Moscow Conservatory</a>, where he studied under <a href="Konstantin%20Igumnov">Konstantin Igumnov</a>, and from which he graduated in 1912. His first professional performance, at the Conservatory, was a performance of <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%201%20%28Brahms%29">Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 in D Minor</a>, conducted by <a href="Serge%20Koussevitzky">Serge Koussevitzky</a>. Luboshutz then traveled to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to study under <a href="%C3%89douard%20Risler">Édouard Risler</a>.

Luboshutz's siblings were also musicians—one sister, <a href="Lea%20Luboshutz">Lea Luboshutz</a>, became a noted violinist and violin teacher; the other, Anna Luboshutz, became a cellist. Upon his return to Russia, Luboshutz played in a trio with his sisters and "performed widely in Russia". In 1919, Luboshutz also accompanied American dancer <a href="Isadora%20Duncan">Isadora Duncan</a> on a tour of Russia. He traveled to the United States in 1926 as accompanist to a group including violinist <a href="Efrem%20Zimbalist">Efrem Zimbalist</a> and cellist <a href="Gregor%20Piatigorsky">Gregor Piatigorsky</a>. In 1929, Luboshutz was conducting a master-class at the Paris Conservatory, where he met Genia Nemenoff, who was enrolled as a student. They fell in love, and in 1931, when she traveled to the United States to join Luboshutz on a concert tour, she became his wife.

On Jan. 18, 1937, they debuted a two‐piano concert tour under the name Luboshutz-Nemenoffat, with their first performance taking place at <a href="The%20Town%20Hall%20%28New%20York%20City%29">The Town Hall</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. The pair became "highly acclaimed as duo pianists", and at different points in their career received excellent reviews from critics <a href="Howard%20Taubman">Howard Taubman</a> and Noel Straus. They "toured widely in the Western hemisphere and <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>", and performed at the <a href="Tanglewood%20Music%20Festival">Tanglewood Music Festival</a> with the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a>, and at <a href="Robin%20Hood%20Dell">Robin Hood Dell</a> with the <a href="Philadelphia%20Orchestra">Philadelphia Orchestra</a>. In 1956, they were joined by Luboshutz's nephew by his sister Lea, <a href="Boris%20Goldovsky">Boris Goldovsky</a>, for a five-week tour highlighting arrangements of the music of <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> for two and three pianos, as part of the bicentennial of Mozart's birth.

The duo "began to curtail their performing career in the early 1960's", accepting teaching positions at the <a href="New%20England%20Conservatory%20of%20Music">New England Conservatory of Music</a> and in the piano department of <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a>, which they headed from 1962 to 1968. The couple then returned to New York City, and lived between there and <a href="Rockport%2C%20Maine">Rockport, Maine</a>.

Luboshutz died in Rockport, at the age of 76. He was survived by his wife, who died in 1989.

Bazanji

Shad Albarazanji (Born August 6, 1995), known professionally as Bazanji, is an American hip hop artist of <a href="Kurds">Kurdish</a> descent. The 22-year-old artist was born in <a href="Bishop%27s%20Stortford">Bishop's Stortford</a>, England and moved to <a href="Chapel%20Hill%2C%20North%20Carolina">Chapel Hill, North Carolina</a> at the age of 6. Bazanji is also a full-time dental school student at the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>. He has been validating his path into the hip-hop scene with over 14 million online streams and many performances alongside noteworthy artists such as <a href="DJ%20Khaled">DJ Khaled</a>. Before discovering hip-hop, Bazanji experienced a rich taste of music as a drummer in various rock bands. Due to his musical background, he made it a priority to be in control of all aspects of his work, as he handles all writing, engineering, mixing, mastering, and occasional production. Bazanji hopes to tell his story as a student artist; an uncommon occurrence in current hip-hop.

Career.
2013-2014.
Bazanji started recording music during his freshman year of college at the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> while in his dorm room.

Early on in his career, Bazanji received spotlight from respected hip-hop websites, such as <a href="HotNewHipHop">HotNewHipHop</a>, where he was selected as a finalist of the Heatseekers competition.

In September 2014, Bazanji released "Paradox", a mixtape that revolved around the "idea that being both a student and a rapper is a living contradiction."

2015-2016.
Following the release of "Paradox", Bazanji released 7 records on his <a href="SoundCloud">SoundCloud</a> page, which have accumulated nearly 3 million cumulative streams. His record, "The City (ft. Cam Meekins & Jackson Breit) (Prod. SimsBeats"), was released on April 16, 2015 and has almost 2 million streams on Spotify alone.

In February 2016, Bazanji released "High Definition", a mixtape that he states was "inspired by [his] experiences over the last few months, including [his] senior year of college, old girls, and a taste of success."

2017.
Bazanji gained lots of buzz in 2017 as his records "Fed Up", "Lights Go Down", and "Mannequins (ft. Anthony Russo)" each gained over 1 million streams on <a href="Spotify">Spotify</a> within 8 months of release. Also, Bazanji recorded the introduction for <a href="Tazz">Tazz</a>'s internet radio show, "The Taz Show". In April 2017, he performed with DJ Khaled at the University of Miami.

Fictional character biography.
The Jammer is the alter ego of Gordon “Gordie” Kirby, an otherwise normal guy who found he enjoyed patrolling the rooftops of his home city in a crime-fighting costume (a Sears jogging suit, modified by his sister to include a mask). He's not really a superhero, he often finds himself in the right place at the right time, and is compelled to act heroically. Sometimes he is hired to do good deeds. His own view of his goals is summed up by his desire “To dominate the world with peace, love, and free beer.” Through the course of his career, he has battled terrorists, an insane psychiatrist, and even servants of the Devil.

Notable characters.

To Get Her.
"To Get Her" (2011) is a graphic novel about Gordon Kirby outside of his role as the Jammer. It documents his struggles as an aspiring cartoonist and his tumultuous relationship with his girlfriend Janet Ditko.

Powers and abilities.
The Jammer is athletic and in good physical shape. He regularly leaps from one rooftop to another in his dense urban neighborhood. The Jammer is a capable hand-to-hand combatant. He has knocked armed assailants unconscious, subdued a religious fanatic who was assaulting a woman in the street, and easily defended himself from a multi-person attack in the back of a police wagon. The Jammer has also displayed a resistance to <a href="hypnosis">hypnotic induction</a>.

Equipment.
The Jammer’s costume consists of a customized Sears thermal hooded jogging suit, a white belt, and white cavalier-style gloves and boots. His sister Nancy added an inverted orange triangle to the chest as an emblem and more material to the hood to form a mask. The Jammer’s self-styled “futility belt” features a large latch buckle with four tubular containers on either side (eight total). From this belt, he has produced smoke bombs, business cards, and a dog whistle.

Piano Trio No. 44 (Haydn)

<a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Joseph Haydn's</a> <a href="Piano%20Trio">Piano Trio</a> No. 44 in E major, Hob. XV/28 was written in 1797. It is the second of a set of three trios dedicated to Mrs. Therese Jansen-Bartolozzi, and is noted for its especially wide expressive range as well as its virtuosity. It is in three movements:


The trio opens with an ascending theme presented, untypically, by the violin and cello in pizzicato; the effect is reminiscent of a harp. The piano answers with an ornamented legato version of the same theme, before all three instruments burst into a lively bridge section leading toward the dominant. The opening theme is reproduced in the development section in a rich, full-bodied version in A-flat major. The second movement, set in the tonic minor, strongly evokes the <a href="passacaglia">passacaglia</a> genre. Its creeping bass line is first introduced by all three instruments in unison, before the piano introduces a winding, ornamental melody over the top of it; later, the melody and bass are used in invertible counterpoint. This movement has numerous features that link it with the second movement of Bach's <a href="Italian%20Concerto">Italian Concerto</a>. The lively triple-time finale introduces a theme in short phrases, with a playfulness both in its rhythms and in its irregular length. The violin takes over in the minor-mode middle section, which includes an extraordinary modulation to E-flat minor, while the return of the opening material is accompanied by changes in register, and the action is temporarily suspended by several diminished seventh chords before the music comes to a close.

Ula Sickle

Ula Sickle (<a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, 1978) is a Canadian / Polish choreographer and performer residing in the <a href="Brussels-Capital%20Region">Brussels-Capital Region</a>.

Training.
Ula Sickle studied art history and semiotics at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> and then performing arts at the Université Paris 8. Afterwards she moved to <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, where she studied at the dance school <a href="P.A.R.T.S.">P.A.R.T.S.</a> from 2000 to 2004. From 2008 to 2010, she continued to deepen her knowledge in visual arts and film during studies at Le Fresnoy - Studio National des Arts Contemporains in Tourcoing.

Work as a choreographer.
Since 2004, Ula Sickle works as an independent choreographer. Her artistic work takes on different forms, from video to installations and stage performances. Since 2004, she made twelve stage performances, a video and an installation. The work was presented at, among others, Kaaitheater, KVS and Kunstenfestivaldesarts (Brussels), <a href="ImPulsTanz_Vienna_International_Dance_Festival">ImPulsTanz</a> and TanzQuartier (<a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>), Teatr Nowy (<a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, Zodiac & Moving in November festival (<a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>), Reykjavik Dance Festival, Tangente (<a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>), B:OM festival (<a href="Seoul">Seoul</a>), Zürcher Theater Spektakel (<a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>) and les Rencontres chorégraphiques internationales de Seine-Saint-Denis (<a href="Paris">Paris</a>).

Collaborations.
She often collaborates with artists from other domains such as visual arts (e.g., Alexis Destoop and Daniela Bershan), contemporary music (e.g., Yann Leguay, Peter Lenaerts and Stine Janvin Motland) or architecture (e.g., Laurent Liefooghe). With Alexis Destoop and Peter Lenaerts, she began during her studies at P.A.R.T.S. also the collective Rebecca September, which resulted in the production "Knockout" (Rebecca September, 2005). For " Viewmaster" (2007-2008) and "Viewmaster Series" (2010-2012) she worked together with the dancer and performance artist Heike Langsdorf. With Heike Langsdorf, Christophe Meierhans and Christoph Ragg (together C&H), she also collaborated on their performance "The Nickelodeon" (C&H, 2008). Before she was a dancer in "Vost" (Mårten Spångberg, 2004). In 2017 she collaborates as a choreographer on the production "7EVEN", that is based on "The 7 Necessities", the artistic manifesto of choreographer / dancer Emio Greco and choreographer / director Pieter C. Scholten. It consists of seven new works of seven minutes created by seven artists and performed by seven dancers of the Ballet National Marseille and ICK.

Alternative canon for contemporary dance.
In her productions, Ula Sickle is looking for ways to open the canon of contemporary dance, which is strongly influenced by evolutions in Europe and North America. That prompted her to seek performers who embody another movement history. A point of departure is her interest in contemporary popular music and dance, such as found in, among others, the nightclubs of the Congolese capital <a href="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a>. Contemporary popular music and dance are often claimed to be commercial and standardized, and they would foster the blurring of moral standards and social escapism. But because they can cross language barriers, they make cultural exchanges widely possible in a globalized world. In the productions "Solid Gold" (Ula Sickle, Dinozord and Yann Leguay, 2010), "Jolie" (Ula Sickle, Yann Leguay and Jolie Ngemi, 2011) and "Kinshasa Electric" (Ula Sickle, Popol Amisi, Daniela Bershan, Jeannot Kumbonyeki and Joel Tenda, 2014), Ula Sickle therefore worked with Congolese performers whose diverse and complex background is far from her own Western dance background. In the productions, she follows the individual history of the dancers and the way in which their movements are culturally and politically colored. But Ula Sickle not only works with non-Western dancers to break the canon of contemporary dance, in "Extreme Tension" (Ula Sickle, Marie De Corte and Yann Leguay, 2012-14) she worked with an older dancer. Her interest in globalized pop culture, not only as music but also as a web of references, trends, attitudes and gestures, was also the basis of "Extended Play" (2016), in which she collaborated again with Daniela Bershan (aka DJ Baba Electronics).

Dialogue between body and technology.
In "Extended Play", Ula Sickle uses a specially designed music jacket and wireless microphones, allowing the performers to compose and play the music live. Technology and the relationship between man and device is another common thread through her productions. Bodies engage in dialogue with smartphones, amplifiers, microphones or light sources. In "Prelude" (Ula Sickle, Stine Janvin Motland and Yann Leguay, 2014), subtle live sound modeling often makes it unclear whether Stine Janvin Motland, known for her original extensive vocal techniques, sings or that her faint sounds are manipulated digitally. In "Light Solos" (Ula Sickle and Yann Leguay, 2011-2013), stroboscopes play a crucial role. The flashes of darkness and light follow each other at an extreme pace, so the viewer can never see the dancer in her totality, but only in fragments that already disappear when they appear. In this way Ula Sickle examines how the sensory and cognitive experience of reality is mediated by technology.

Videos and installations.
In addition to her stage performances, Ula Sickle also makes audiovisual work, often associated with her stage performances. The video "Atomic 5.1" (2010) is based on one of her "Light Solos" (Ula Sickle and Yann Leguay, 2011-2013). The video installation "Looping the Loop" (2009), which focuses on a young Congolese hiphopper, was at the origin of "Solid Gold" (Ula Sickle, Dinozord and Yann Leguay, 2010). Both works were produced by Le Fresnoy during her residence there.

Alauddin Khilji's conquest of Ranthambore

In 1301 <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a>, the ruler of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> in India, conquered the neighbouring kingdom of Ranastambhapura (modern <a href="Ranthambore">Ranthambore</a>).

<a href="Hammiradeva">Hammira</a>, the <a href="Chahamanas%20of%20Ranastambhapura">Chahamana</a> (Chauhan) king of Ranthambore, had granted asylum to some <a href="Mongols">Mongol</a> rebels from Delhi in 1299. He refused requests to either kill these rebels or hand them over to Alauddin, resulting in an invasion from Delhi. Hammira lost his general Bhimasimha to an army led by Alauddin's general <a href="Ulugh%20Khan">Ulugh Khan</a>, and his brother Bhoja <a href="defection">defected</a> to Alauddin some days later. After recovering from these initial reverses, Hammira's generals (including the Mongol rebels) defeated Ulugh Khan's army at a mountain pass near Ranthambore. Alauddin then dispatched his general Nusrat Khan to reinforce Ulugh Khan's army, but Nusrat Khan was killed while besieging the fort.

Alauddin then himself took control of the operations at Ranthambore. He ordered the construction of a mound to scale its walls. After a long siege, the defenders suffered from a famine and defections. Facing a desperate situation, in July 1301, Hammira and his loyal companions came out of the fort, and fought to death. His wives, daughters and other female relatives committed "<a href="jauhar">jauhar</a>" (mass self-immolation). Alauddin captured the fort, and appointed Ulugh Khan as its governor.

Background.
Ranthambore was was reputed as an impregnable fort, and Alauddin's predecessor <a href="Jalaluddin%20Khilji">Jalaluddin</a> had made an unsuccessful attempt to capture it in 1291.

In 1299, Alauddin Khilji sent his generals Nusrat Khan and <a href="Ulugh%20Khan">Ulugh Khan</a> to capture <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. This army included several <a href="Mongols">Mongol</a> soldiers (also called Mughals or neo-Muslims), who had converted to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> recently. When the army was returning to Delhi after its successful campaign, some of the Mongols <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji%27s%20conquest%20of%20Gujarat%23Mutiny%20near%20Jalore">staged a mutiny</a> against the generals, near <a href="Jalore">Jalore</a>. The mutiny was crushed, and the army returned to Delhi. Two rebel Mongol leaders — Muhammad Shah and Kabhru — managed to escape with some of their followers. <a href="Hammiradeva">Hammira</a> of Ranthambore (called Hamir Dev in Muslim chronicles) granted asylum to these Mongol fugitives.

Ulugh Khan was the governor of <a href="Bayana">Bayana</a> near Ranthambore. After returning to Bayana from Delhi, he sent messengers to Hammira, urging him to kill the Mongol fugitives as a friendly ruler. He also threatened to wage a war against Hammira, if this request was not complied with. Hammira's counsellors advised him not to endanger his kingdom, and comply. However, Hammira refused to do so. He replied to Ulugh Khan that he had no desire to start a conflict, but he would not give up the refugees who had sought his asylum. He added that he was not afraid of a war, and had enough money and soldiers to participate in a war.

Death of Bhimasimha.
When Alauddin learned about Hammira's reply, he dispatched an army led by Ulugh Khan to capture Ranthambore. According to "Hammira Mahakavya" and "Surjana-Charita", Hammira was engaged in a religious ceremony at the time of this invasion. Ulugh Khan's army marched unopposed up to the <a href="Banas%20River">Banas River</a>. There, Hammira's general Bhimasimha stopped his advance. Bhimasimha underestimated the strength of the Delhi, and launched a direct attacked on them, instead of keeping his army stationed at the top of the mountain pass leading to Ranthambore. The Delhi army retreated temporarily, possibly deliberately to fool the Chahamanas into dropping their guard. This led Bhimasimha to believe that he had foiled the invasion. However, while Bhimasimha was returning to Ranthambore, Ulugh Khan's forces re-assembled and attacked his contingent. The defenders were defeated, and Bhimasimha was killed in the battle.

Bhoja's defection to Alauddin.
Bhimasimha had abandoned his strong position at the top of the mountain pass on the advance of the minister Dharmasimha. As a punishment, Hammira ordered Dharmasimha to be castrated and blinded, declaring that only a blind man would have failed to see the true strength of the invading army, and only an impotent man would have allowed Bhimasimha to die on the battlefield. After Dharmasimha's dismissal, Hammira's brother Bhoja became the chief royal counsellor. However, Bhoja was unable to arrange sufficient money for raising an army that could defeat Alauddin's invasion. In the past, the Chahamanas had raised money by raiding their neighbours, but this was not possible as they were under siege.

Dharmasimha, who now maintained a grudge against Hammira, took advantage of this financial crunch. He contacted the king through a court dancer named Dhara. He offered to arrange horses for Hammira's cavalry from Malwa. Hammira took Dharmasimha back into service. Dharmasimha raised money by imposing heavy taxes, which made Hammira very unpopular among his subjects. Dharmasimha also sidelined Bhoja: on his advice, Hammira ordered Bhoja to provide a full account of the ministry during his tenure.

The "Hammira Mahakavya" further states that Bhoja and his brother Pithasimha decided to leave Ranthambore as a result of Dharmasimha's scheming. Hammira did not try to stop his brothers, and instead, gave Bhoja's post of "danda-nayaka" to his general Ratipala. Feeling insulted, Bhoja defected to Alauddin, who received him with honour. Alauddin gave him the "<a href="jagir">jagir</a>" (fief) of Jagara, which was earlier held by the rebel Mongol leader Muhammad Shah. Bhoja advised Hammira to attack Ranthambore before the <a href="harvest">harvest</a> season. Alauddin dispatched a large army (100,000-strong, according to "Hammira Mahakavya") to conquer Ranthambore.

Chahamana victory at Hinduvata.
According to the "Hammira Mahakavya", the Delhi army marched to Ranthambore, ransacking the Hindu territories on their way. At a mountain pass called Hinduvata, the Chahamana army inflicted a heavy defeat on the Delhi forces. This army was led by Hammira's own generals as well as the Mongol leaders who had taken asylum at Ranthambore. Hammira's own generals included Virama (his brother), Ratipala, Jaja and Ranamalla. The Mongol leaders included Muhammad Shah (called Mahimashahi by Nayachandra), his brother Garbharuka, Tichara and Vaichara (the last three are Sanskritized names given in "Hammira Mahakavya": the original names are not certain).

The Chahamana army captured much of the Delhi army's equipment as a result of this victory. The "Hammira Mahakavya" states that the Chahamanas also captured a large number of Muslim women after this victory. These women were forced to sell sour buttermilk in the villages of Hammira's kingdom, in order to spread the news of the Chahamana victory.

Hammira's Mongol allies then attacked Jagara, the former jagir of Muhammad Shah that Alauddin had granted to Bhoja. They captured Bhoja's family members, and brought them to Ranthambore as prisoners. Bhoja survived the attack, as he was at Delhi. The 14th century "Pakrta-Paingalam" claims that Hammira's officer Jaja marched towards Delhi, striking fear into the hearts of its Muslim citizens, although the text does not mention what was the result of this march.

Death of Nusrat Khan.
After these initial reverses, Alauddin asked Nusrat Khan, the governor of <a href="Awadh">Awadh</a>, to lead an army in Ulugh Khan's support. The joint armies of Nusrat Khan and Ulugh Khan invaded Hammira's territory.

The "Hammira Mahakavya" claims that this time, Ulugh Khan pretended that he was coming to negotiate a truce with Hammira. As a result, Hammira did not resist the invaders' entry into his territory, and the Delhi army crossed the Hinduvata mountain pass easily. The Delhi army captured a place named Jhain, and renamed it as "Shahr-i Nau" ("new town"). The modern identity of this place is not known, but historian <a href="Kishori%20Saran%20Lal">Kishori Saran Lal</a> speculated that it might be the present-day Nayagaon (or Naigaon) village located near Ranthambore.

Finally, the Delhi army reached Ranthambore, and encamped near the fort walls. According to the "Hammira Mahakavya", a messenger from Alauddin offered two alternatives to Hammira:


Hammira scornfully rejected the demands, and replied that Alauddin could have 400,000 sword wounds instead. The Delhi army then besieged the fort, and tried to scale its walls. One day, Nusrat Khan was hit by a <a href="manjaniq">manjaniq</a> stone; he died after 2-3 days. Taking advantage of the mourning in the invaders' camp, Hammira came out of the fort with a strong army, and forced Ulugh Khan to retreat to Jhain. According to the 16th century writer Firishta, Hammira's force was 200,000-strong, but this appears to be an exaggeration. Another chronicler Yahya states that Hammira had less than 12,000 cavalry, several elephants and "innumerable" infantry. Amir Khusrau estimates the strength of Hammira's cavalry as 10,000.

Alauddin at Ranthambore.
When Alauddin learned about Ulugh Khan's defeat, he decided to personally lead a stronger force to Ranthambore. He ordered his other officers from various provinces to bring their armies to <a href="Tilpat">Tilpat</a> near Delhi. While these armies were on their way to Tilpat, he spent his time <a href="hunting">hunting</a>. During one such hunting expedition, his nephew Sulaiman Shah <a href="Rebellions%20against%20Alauddin%20Khilji%23Akat%20Khan%27s%20rebellion%2C%201299">Akat Khan conspired to kill him</a>. However, the conspiracy was not successful, and Akat Khan and his companions were executed.

When Alauddin reached Ranthambore, the fort was already surrounded by the Delhi army. He realized that a direct attack on the fort was not feasible: the advantage lay with the defenders. Alauddin's camp was located on a <a href="hillock">hillock</a> called Ran, which faced the Ranthambore Fort's hill. Alauddin ordered the construction of a "pasheb", an inclined mound built to fill the ditch separating his camp and the fort. Weavers from the neighbouring areas were brought, and asked to sew a large number of bags. Alauddin's soldiers then filled these bags with soil, and used them to build the "pasheb" mound.

The construction of the "pasheb" was a long and difficult process for the invading army. But none of Alauddin's soldiers deserted him, because he demanded three years' pay from any deserter. The Delhi army used the <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s called "maghrabis" to shoot stones at the defending garrison. But the defenders kept destroying the under-construction "pasheb" with fire and stones. Alauddin's army also tried to construct a tunnel, but the defenders destroyed it and killed those involved in its construction by throwing a mixture of oil and resin on them. There was heavy loss of lives on both the sides. During this time, Alauddin's army also plundered the neighbouring region, going as far as <a href="Dhar">Dhar</a> in the <a href="Paramara">Paramara</a> territory.

While Alauddin was at Ranthambore, there were two attempts to usurp the power in Delhi. In the first attempt, his nephews <a href="Rebellions%20against%20Alauddin%20Khilji%23Rebellion%20of%20Malik%20Umar%20and%20Mangu%20Khan">Malik Umar and Mangu Khan</a> started recruiting soldiers to overthrow his rule. But Alauddin sent his officers to subdue him. The two brothers were brought to Ranthambore, and killed. Sometime later, an officer named <a href="Rebellions%20against%20Alauddin%20Khilji%23Rebellion%20of%20Haji%20Maula">Haji Maula</a> took control of Delhi and appointed one Alavi as the puppet Sultan. Alauddin first sent Malik Hamiduddin, who killed Haji Maula and Alavi. Some days later, he also sent Ulugh Khan, who had the other rebels executed. Despite these rebellions, Alauddin did not abandon his campaign to conquer Ranthambore.

Ratipala's defection to Alauddin.
The "Hammira Mahakavya" states that during the siege, Alauddin once offered to negotiate a peace treaty. As a result, Hammira sent his general Ratipala (or Ratanpal) to Alauddin's camp. Alauddin received Ratipala with great honour, and treated him good food and drinks. Alauddin then won Ratipala over to his side, by promising him the governship of Ranthambore after Hammira's defeat.

After returning to Ranthambore, Ratipala did not inform Hammira about what had actually transpired at the meeting. Instead, he told Hammira that Alauddin was willing to establish peace in return for marriage to Hammira's daughter. Later, he also turned another general named Ranamalla (or Ranmal) against Hammira. One evening, Ratipala and Ranamalla led their forces out of the fort, and joined Alauddin's army.

Hammira's last stand.
The construction of the pasheb, which started in March-April ("<a href="Rajab">Rajab</a>"), seems to have finished around the beginning of the rainy season in July. By this time, the defenders had exhausted their provisions. According to <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a>, the fort had become a "desert of thorns" due to scarcity of water and green leaves: the people were willing to purchase "one grain of corn for two grains of gold", but still could not get it. The Rajput bardic chronicles claim that the scarcity of food resulted from a conspiracy by Sarjan Shah, a Buddhist merchant ("bania") belonging to the Sharaoji sect. Sarjan Shah's father had been killed by Hammira. To avenge his father's death, he polluted the provisions stored in the fort with animal hides, thus rendering them unusable for the Hindus.

Having been betrayed by his trusted generals, and under the famine-like cirumstances in the fort, Hammira realized that Alauddin would capture the fort sooner or later. Hammira decided to fight to death with his loyal men, while the ladies of the fort prepared for suicide by "<a href="jauhar">jauhar</a>" (mass self-immolation to avoid falling into the enemy hands). According to the "Hammira Mahakavya", Hammira offered to escort the Mongol refugees to a safe place. However, the Mongol leader Muhammad Shah refused the offer: he killed his wife and children, and declared that he would join Hammira's <a href="last%20stand">last stand</a>. Hammira asked his brother Virama to be his successor, but Virama too decided to accompany Hammira in his last fight.

Hammira had all his valuables thrown into the Padmasara lake, and appointed his minister Jaja (also Jajala or Jajadeva) as his successor. Like other loyalists, Jaja had also been offered a safe passage out of the fort, but decided to stay behind. He supervised the organization of the "jauhar", in which Hammira's queens, daughters and other female relatives committed suicide. Hammira and his loyal companions marched to the top of the "pasheb" mound, where they fought to death with Alauddin's army. Some Rajput-era bards claim that Hammira severed his own head and offered it to the god <a href="Shiva">Mahadeva</a> when faced with a certain defeat.

Aftermath.
Accordng to the 16th century historian <a href="Firishta">Firishta</a>, Alauddin's army captured the fort on 10 July 1301. However, the Jain author Nayachandra dates this conquest to two days later in his "Hammira Mahakavya". According to Nayachandra, Jaja continued to offer resistance for two more days after Hammira's death, which may explain this discrepancy.

In the fort, Alauddin found the Mongol rebel Muhammad Shah lying wounded. Alauddin asked Muhammad Shah what he would do if pardoned and saved. Muhammad Shah replied that he would kill Alauddin and appoint Hammira's son as the new king. An angry Alauddin ordered Muhammad Shah to be trampled by an elephant. However, later he ordered Muhammad Shah to be buried with honour because of he appreciated the dead man's courage and loyalty.

Alauddin ordered punishments for Ratipala and Ranamalla, who had deserted Hammira to join him. Ratipala was flayed alive, while Ranamalla and his followers were killed. Alauddin argued that these people had not been loyal to their earlier master, so he did not expect them to be loyal to him.

The victors destroyed the Vaghabhatta (Bahar Deo) temple and other buildings in the fort premises. Before returning to Delhi, Alauddin gave the control of the fort to Ulugh Khan. However, the local public hated Ulugh Khan so much, that he decided not to go beyond the suburbs of Ranthambore.

<doc id="54762676" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54762676" title="Iji Castle">
Iji Castle

The actual pronouciation of the name of this fortification remains uncertain, as the "<a href="kanji">kanji</a>" of its name can also be read as "Koreharu Castle".

Background.
In the late <a href="Nara%20period">Nara period</a>, after the establishment of a centralized government under the "<a href="Ritsury%C5%8D">Ritsuryō</a>" system, the <a href="Yamato%20dynasty">Yamato court</a> sent a number of military expeditions to what is now the <a href="T%C5%8Dhoku%20region">Tōhoku region</a> of northern Japan to bring the local <a href="Emishi">Emishi</a> tribes under its control. After the establishment of <a href="Taga%20Castle">Taga Castle</a>, Yamato forces gradually pushed into the hinterland of what is now Miyagi Prefecture, establishing several fortified settlements against increasing <a href="Emishi">Emishi</a> opposition. A fort was built on this site in 767 AD.

During the <a href="H%C5%8Dki">Hōki</a> era (770-781), a widespread rebellion by the <a href="Emishi">Emishi</a> against the Yamato invaders erupted in the <a href="Kitakami%20River">Kitakami River</a> valley. Yamato forces lost several battles and a large counter-offensive in 776 AD failed. By 780 AD, the Emishi had advanced to the Sendai plains, even destroying settlements to the south of Iji Castle. In May 780, the "<a href="Chinjufu%20shogun">Chinjufu shogun</a>" <a href="Ki%20no%20Hirozumi">Ki no Hirozumi</a> established his headquarters at Iji Castle in preparation for a new offensive intended to cut off the Emishi invasion route. However, a senior "Emishi" officer in the Yamato army, Iji no Kimi Azamaro (whose name could also possibly be read as "Koreharu no Kimi Azamaro") killed the general along with the inspector of <a href="Oshika%20District%2C%20Miyagi">Oshiki District</a>, Ōdate Michishima at Iji Castle and rose in revolt. A few days later, he attacked <a href="Taga%20Castle">Taga Castle</a> itself, which he plundered and burned.

Iji no Azamaro was an "Emishi" who had received the unprecedented <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20court%20ranks%2C%20positions%20and%20hereditary%20titles">court rank</a> of junior fourth rank, which made him an aristocrat. The "<a href="Shoku%20Nihongi">Shoku Nihongi</a>" records that he was frequently insulted by Ōdate Michishima because of his background.

Description.
The ruins are located near the center of the former town of Tsukidate within Kurihara city. The fort consisted of a rectangular enclosure, approximately 700 meters east-west by 900 meters north-south, consisting of an earthen <a href="Rampart%20%28fortification%29">rampart</a> surmounted by a wooden <a href="palisade">palisade</a>, and protected by a dry moat. There were a total of twelve gates in the walls, with the largest at the center of the southern wall. Post holes, foundation stones and fragments of roof tiles from structures which once stood in the middle of the enclosure, along with fragments of weapons have been found.

There is nothing to be seen at the site today except for a commemorative signpost. <a href="Japan%20National%20Route%204">Japan National Route 4</a> cuts through the site diagonally.

Rebellions against Alauddin Khilji

<a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a>, the ruler of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> in India, faced three rebellions in 1301, while engaged in the <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji%27s%20conquest%20of%20Ranthambore">conquest of Ranthambore</a>. The first rebellion was led by his nephews Akat Khan, who tried to assassinate him during a hunting expedition at <a href="Tilpat">Tilpat</a>, and was beheaded as a punishment. The second rebellion was also led by his nephews, this time Malik Umar and Mangu Khan, who started recruiting soldiers to overthrow Alauddin's rule in <a href="Awadh">Awadh</a>. The rebellion was crushed by Alauddin's loyal officers, and the rebels were executed. The third rebellion was staged by an officer named Haji Maula in Delhi. It was crushed by Alauddin's loyal officer Malik Hamiduddin, and once agian, the rebels were killed.

Earlier, Alauddin's generals Nusrat Khan and Ulugh Khan had also faced a <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji%27s%20conquest%20of%20Gujarat%23Mutiny%20near%20Jalore">mutiny near Jalore</a>. Alauddin held meetings with his council of ministers to determine the causes of these rebellions. Based on their advice, he took several measures to prevent any further uprisings: he set up an <a href="espionage">intelligence</a> and <a href="surveillance">surveillance</a> network, instituted <a href="prohibition">prohibition</a> in Delhi, prevented the nobles from networking with each other, and confiscated wealth from the residents of Delhi. After these steps were taken, no serious rebellions took place during Alauddin's reign.

Akat Khan's rebellion.
After his generals <a href="Ulugh%20Khan">Ulugh Khan</a> and Nusrat Khan failed to capture <a href="Ranthambore">Ranthambore</a>, Alauddin decided to lead a stronger force to Ranthambore in 1301. He ordered his other officers from various provinces to bring their armies to <a href="Tilpat">Tilpat</a> near Delhi. While these armies were on their way to Tilpat, he spent his time <a href="hunting">hunting</a>. During one such hunting expedition, his nephew Sulaiman Shah Akat Khan (or Ikat Khan) conspired to kill him in the Badah village near Tilpat. Alauddin had ordered his horsemen to form a circle in order to drive the <a href="game%20%28hunting%29">game</a> towards him. Akat Khan and some Mongol Muslims in his service rode towards Alauddin, shouting "Tiger!", and started shooting arrows at the Sultan. A slave named Manik (or Nayak) threw himself in front of Alauddin, and received four arrow wounds. Then Alauddin's bodyguards came forward and protected him with shields. Despite these efforts and his heavy winter clothing, Alauddin received two deep arrow wounds in his arm, and fell unconscious. When Akat Khan came closer, Alauddin's guards told him that the Sultan was dead.

Akat Khan then went to the royal camp, announced that he had killed Alauddin, and proclaimed himself the new Sultan. Several officers welcomed him, but Malik Dinar, the officer in-charge of Alauddin's <a href="harem">harem</a>, resisted him. When Akat Khan tried to enter the harem, Malik Dinar asked him to present Alauddin's head as evidence of his claim of having killed Alauddin.

Meanwhile, Alauddin gained consciousness, and decided to run away to Ulugh Khan's camp, suspecting a deeper conspiracy by multiple nobles. However, his loyal officer Malik Hamiduddin advised him that his presence at the camp was necessary to quell the rebellion. Alauddin then proceeded to the camp with 500-600 horsemen. Akat Khan fled to Afghanpur, but two officers pursued him and killed him. They brought his head to Alauddin, who remarked that he often had that head in his lap. Akat Khan's head was paraded on a spear: first in Alauddin's camp at Tilpat, then throughout the imperical capital Delhi, and then in <a href="Ulugh%20Khan">Ulugh Khan</a>'s camp at Jhain. Alauddin then ordered the killing of Akat Khan's younger brother Qutlugh Khan.

Over the next few days, Alauddin stayed at Tilpat to recover from his injuries. He also made inquiries into the conspiracy against him, and ordered severe punishments against those found guilty. Their wives and children were imprisoned, and their property was confiscated.

Rebellion of Malik Umar and Mangu Khan.
Some days after Akat Khan's death, Alauddin marched to Ranthambore. While he was busy besieging Ranthambore, two of his nephews conspired to usurp the power in Delhi. These were Malik Umar (the governor of Badaun) and Mangu Khan (the governor of Awadh). Both were sons of a sister of Alauddin.

The rebellion started in Awadh, but the cause of the rebellion is not certain. The two brothers started recruiting soldiers to overthrow Alauddin's rule. However, before they could cause any serious damage, Alauddin sent his officers to arrest them. The two brothers were brought to Ranthambore, and had their "eyes carved out like slices of melon" before being killed. Their family members and followers were also killed.

Rebellion of Haji Maula.
A third rebellion happened during Alauddin's Ranthambore campaign. Bayazid Tirmizi, who succeeded Alaul Mulk as the <a href="kotwal">kotwal</a> of Delhi, had become very unpopular in the city because of his harshness. Taking advantage of his unpopularity, and of Alauddin's absence from Delhi, an officer named Haji Maula decided to take control of Delhi. Haji Maula was the "shunah" (superintendent of crown lands) of Bartol, a town in the Doab region. He had earlier served Malikul Umara Fakhruddin, a former kotwal of Delhi, and enlisted the support of the <a href="Mamluk%20dynasty%20%28Delhi%29">Mamluk</a>-era kotwali staff.

At that time, Bayazid was supervising repairs to the <a href="Gates%20of%20Delhi">Badaun Gate</a>, and had taken up residence in a small house nearby. During the month of <a href="Ramadan">Ramadan</a> (May-June) in 1299, when most residents of Delhi were taking a siesta, Haji Maula arrived at Bayazid's residence, accompanied by four armed men. They summoned Bayazid to hear a message from Alauddin. When Bayazid came out, Haji Maula ordered his killing. Haji Maula then produced a "<a href="firman">firman</a>" before the public, claiming that Alauddin had issued an order to kill Bayazid. He also summoned Alauddin Ayaz, the kotwal of the under-construction <a href="Siri%20Fort">Siri Fort</a>. However, Ayaz refused to oblige, and protected himself by ordering the closure of the Siri gates.

Haji Maula and his soldiers then took control of the royal Red Palace, the treasury, the armoury, the horse stables and the prison. To gain supporters, Haji Maula distributed the money from the treasuring among the people of Delhi. He also freed the state prisoners, some of whom joined him.

Alauddin heard about the events in Delhi 3 days after the beginning of the revolt. He kept the news a secret from his soldiers at Ranthambore, but sent his loyal officer Malik Hamiduddin to quell the rebellion Delhi. Hamiduddin, who held the post of "amir-i-koh", arrived in Delhi the next day, and entered Delhi through the Ghazni Gate.

Meanwhile, Haji Maula felt that his position was insecure as he had no claim over the royal throne. Therefore, he decided to install a <a href="puppet%20ruler">puppet ruler</a>. Towards this objective, he abducted a man named Alavi, who was a descendant of a daughter of the earlier Sultan <a href="Iltutmish">Iltutmish</a>. Haji maula forecefully appointed Alavi as the new Sultan of Delhi, and forced the nobles to pay him homage. Haji Maula also appointed his fellow rebels to the various royal offices.

When the news of Alavi's appointment reached Alauddin, he sent his brother Ulugh Khan to Delhi. By the time Ulugh Khan reached Delhi, Hamiduddin had already quelled the revolt. Hamiduddin had defeated Haji Maula's forces after two days of fighting. He was supported by some of Zafar Khan's Amroha-based followers, who had come to Delhi for some court-related work. Haji Maula retreated to the Bhandarkal Gate, where Hamiduddin dragged him from his horse, and killed him. Hamiduddin then killed Alavi at the Red Palace, and had his head paraded across Delhi on a spear.

Hamiduddin's forces took control of the treasury, and brought back the money that had been distributed by Haji Maula. All the surviving rebels were brought before Ulugh Khan, and killed. The grandsons of Haji Maula's former master Fakhruddin were also killed, although they had not played any part in the rebellion.

Measures for preventing rebellions.
While engaged in the <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji%27s%20conquest%20of%20Ranthambore">siege of Ranthambore</a>, Alauddin held meetings with his council ("majlis-i khas") to determine the causes of these rebellions. The council included Alauddin's loyal officials, including Malik Ainul Mulk Multani, Malik Hamiduddin, and Malik A'izzuddin. According to the 14th century chronicler <a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Ziauddin Barani</a>, the council listed the four main causes of rebellions:


After returning from Ranthambore, Alauddin stayed the subrubs of Delhi, where he spent one month in hunting expeditions. The contemporary chroniclers state that he was unhappy with the residents of Delhi, who had displayed their disloyalty during the recent rebellions. However, historian <a href="Kishori%20Saran%20Lal">Kishori Saran Lal</a> theorizes that Alauddin did not enter the city, because "he" was distressed as a result of the rebellions. His predecessor Jalaluddin had also avoided entering Delhi under similar circumstances.

Subsequently, Alauddin took steps to remove the four causes of rebellions outlined by his council, as detailed below. These steps had the desired outcome, and prevented any serious revolt against Alauddin in the following years.

Intelligence and survelliance system.
To ensure that he was not ignorant of the happenings in his kingdom, Alauddin organized an <a href="espionage">intelligence</a> and <a href="surveillance">surveillance</a> system network comprising secret spies ("munhis"), publicly-known intelligence officers ("<a href="barid%20%28caliphate%29%23Surveillance">barids</a>") and their officer-in-charge. These people were assigned to report on everything that happened in the houses of the nobles and the public markets. This fear of spies greatly intimidated the nobles, who took great care in not saying or doing anything that could attract a punishment.

Prohibition.
As per his council's advice, Alauddin instituted a total <a href="prohibition">prohibition</a> in Delhi. This was motivated by political, rather than religious, considerations. He gave up drinking himself, and ordered the royal drinking vassals to be broken in front of the <a href="Gates%20of%20Delhi">Badaun Gate</a>. The formerly-licensed <a href="tavern">tavern</a>s and <a href="distillery">distilleries</a> were asked to move out of Delhi, although this meant a loss of revenue for the state. Alauddin also banned <a href="gambling">gambling</a> and consumption of <a href="bhang">bhang</a>. <a href="Amir%20Khusrau">Amir Khusrau</a> also claims that Alauddin forced <a href="prostitute">prostitute</a>s to get married, although the veracity of this statement is doubtful.

Alauddin's elephant-mounted officers traversed the streets of Delhi, reading out the prohibition orders. Some people disobeyed these orders by preparing illicit liquor at their houses and selling it at high prices. Some also tried to sneak liquor into Delhi from outside the city. Alauddin ordered all these people to be thrown into dry wells dug near the Badaun Gate. Most of them died, and those who survived received severe injuries.

As a result of these steps, liquor became unavailable not only in Delhi, but also in its suburbs. The prohibition was unpopular, and ultimately, Alauddin had to make some concessions. He issued an order allowing people to distill liquor in their own homes for private consumption. However, the ban on selling alchol and organizing drinking parties continued.

Control over the nobles.
According to Barani, Alauddin issued an order preventing the nobles, aristocrats and important officials from visiting each others' houses and from gathering at <a href="banquet">banquet</a>s. They were also disallowed from inviting the general public to their houses. Marital relations among their families were allowed only with prior permission from the Sultan. According to <a href="Firishta">Firishta</a>, if a noble wanted to put up a guest or arrange a marriage, he had to obtain the Sultan's permission by writing to Sayyid Khan Wazir.

Barani further states that there was a strict enforcement of these rules. Even when the nobles met each other at the royal palace, they could not talk with ease. They took great care to avoid people with bad reputation.

Confiscation of wealth.
After ascending the throne of Delhi, Alauddin had made a number of state grants ("milk"), state gifts ("<a href="inamdar%20%28feudal%20title%29">inam</a>") and chartiable endowments ("<a href="waqf">waqf</a>"). As per the council's suggestions, he canceled all these grants to control the monetary supply. The villages that had earlier been granted as "milk", "inam" or "waqf" were re-designated as "khalisa" (the territory whose revenues go directly to the royal treasury). However, there were many exceptions to this order; for example, the 14th century chronicler <a href="Isami%20%28historian%29">Isami</a> writes that the villages grants to his ancestors were not canceled.

Barani gives an exaggerated account of Alauddin's seizure of money from his subjects. According to him, after Alauddin's orders had been carried out, little gold was left in the houses of Delhi. The only exceptions were the houses of the nobles, the aristocrats, the state employees, and the Hindu merchants and bankers.

In 2009–2010 the school had 285 students.

History.
The history of Bonaventure College began in the nineteenth century with the establishment of numerous Catholic secondary schools in the Leiden region. The current Bonaventure College is a merger of all Catholic schools for <a href="secondary%20education">secondary education</a> in <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a> and the surrounding area.

School Struggle legislation.
In the early nineteenth century in the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> region, there was one school for continued Catholic education. In <a href="Katwijk">Katwijk</a> on the Rhine, the College of St. Willibrord was established in 1831, where Catholic students could attend the gymnasium. The College was led by members of the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a>. It was funded by the Catholic Church, because government money was available only to public schools. With the introduction of the constitution of 1848 the limitation on the establishment of Christian schools faded but government support was still unavailable. Nevertheless, the school was expanded in 1905 with a <a href="Hogere%20Burgerschool">Hogere Burgerschool</a>. The Catholic community could only rely on government subsidies for <a href="Special%20Education">special education</a> during much of the <a href="School%20struggle%20%28Netherlands%29">School Struggle</a>. But the issue was resolved in 1920 with all schools being government subsidized.

Saint Bonaventure Foundation.
In 1927 it was announced that Saint Willibrord would move to Saint <a href="Aloysius%20College">Aloysius College</a> in The Hague. As a result, for students from Leiden and surrounding areas there would no longer be any school for continuing Catholic education. Leiden pastor Beukers devoted himself to preserving a high school in the Leiden area. In August 1927, he received from the Catholic Minister of Education Waszink the promise that the government would give a grant for a new secondary institution in Leiden. The first school year 1927–1928 was still under the foundation of Saint Willibrord, but in August 1928 the Bonaventure Educational Foundation was founded in Leiden. The Roman Catholic HBS Saint Bonaventura was led by <a href="Franciscans">Franciscan</a> Father Balduinus de Goede. In 1933 a new building was acquired in the Mariënpoelstraat.

Other congregations at Bonaventure College.
Catholic secondary education in Leiden originated in the beginning of the twentieth century with fathers and sisters of several religious congregations. In 1913, MULO for R.K. Young Women opened at the Leiden Haarlemmerstraat. The school was run by the Sisters of Love of Our Lady, Mother of Mercy, a congregation from Tilburg, which also had a primary school in Leiden. The R.K. School for MULO was opened in 1929 at the Women's Church. Over time, the school was named Titus Brandsma MULO. It offered secondary education to Catholic children from lower socio-economic environments who could learn well.

At the Catholic Vocational School for Girls, Catholic girls at Galgewater learned housekeeping. After the introduction of the Mammoth Act, the school name was changed to LHNO de Noorderwiek. For Catholic boys from Leiden and the surrounding area, R.K. Technical School Don Bosco offered a technical education in the woodwork, metal, and electrical fields. This school started in 1952 on the Vestestraat and moved to Boerhaavelaan in the mid sixties. After the Mammouth Education Act this Handicraft School became an LTS, and was later renamed LTS Het Gilde. On Boommarkt Street in Leiden was the RK VGLO St. Lawrence for children who did not have higher education and wanted to work, but were still of school age.

St. Laurentius and Paul's MAVO merged in the seventies under the name Paul Scholengemenschap. The school moved into a new building on the corner of Kooilaan and Surinamestraat. In 1983 there was a merger of Paul Scholengemeenschap, Wiek LHNO the North, and LTS Guild to "Comprehensive School Leiden". In 1993, "The Leidse" entered the new "Bonaventuracollege" and was housed on the Boerhaavel.


In the media.
On the 28th of September 2009 at the Burggravenlaan the chemical stock crystallized <a href="picric%20acid">picric acid</a> was found. The building was evacuated out of precaution and the school's surroundings were closed down. Because the discovery was well before the start of the first classes, there were not many teachers and students in the school. In September 2010, some "broom movies" appeared with students and teachers of the Mariënpoel Street, which brought the widespread attention of the (national) media.

The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army

The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army (TQILA) is a <a href="Queer%20anarchism">queer anarchist</a> armed group and subunit of the <a href="International%20Revolutionary%20People%27s%20Guerrilla%20Forces">International Revolutionary People's Guerrilla Forces</a> formed on 24 July 2017 by <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> members of the IRPGF, its formation was announced from <a href="Raqqa">Raqqa City</a> along with a statement explaining the purposes of its formation in which the response to <a href="Persecution%20of%20gay%20and%20bisexual%20men%20by%20ISIL">the systematic persecution of LGBT people by the Daesh</a> is highlighted as one of the main motivations of the group.

TQILA is the first LGBT unit to fight against the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a>, and apparently the first LGBT militia in the Middle East.

Formation.
The testimonial image of its formation, in which fighters posed alongside a sign with the motto ""These faggots kill fascists"" and two flags —one belonging to the recent group and an <a href="LGBT%20flag">LGBT flag</a>— that was quickly viralized by several western media that, surprised by the paradoxical unit against Daesh, echoed the event with large repercussions.

The unit, like the rest of the IRPGF, is a member of the <a href="International%20Freedom%20Battalion">International Freedom Battalion</a>, in one of the testimonial photos is sighted "Heval Mahirnota", commander of the International Freedom Battalion, and the <a href="marxist-leninist">marxist-leninist</a> guerrilla <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Turkey/Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist">TKP/ML TİKKO</a>, holding the LGBT flag.
Despite being part of the International Freedom Battalion several media erroneously reported that TQILA could be an official unit of the <a href="Syrian%20Democratic%20Forces">Syrian Democratic Forces</a> which caused confusion. Following the impact of this mistaken information Mustafa Bali, media director of the SDF, denied such information alleging that there is no an LGBT brigade within the coalition, but does not deny the existence of the same which, indeed, belongs to the International Freedom Battalion.

Ideology.
Ideologically the unit is defined as <a href="Queer%20anarchism">queer anarchist</a>, in turn they are part of the IRPGF, an <a href="anarcho-communist">anarcho-communist</a> and <a href="especifist">especifist</a> brigade that claims horizontality, the abolition of the state, the struggle against capitalism, <a href="sexism">sexism</a>, racism and <a href="patriarchy">patriarchy</a>. Also, TQILA affirms that they reject and criticize sexism and <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a> within the <a href="revolutionary%20left">revolutionary left</a>.
They defend the idea of feminism on the Rojava Revolution, the liberation of women and the impulse of the role of women in society against the traditional gender stereotypes in the region. The group affirms that ""TQILA sees this as an opportunity to open up a critical dialogue amongst the revolutionary parties and guerrilla forces about gender and sexuality issues"."

In a statement released on 1 August, the group says that they fight for social autonomy, gender equality, <a href="direct%20democracy">direct democracy</a> and worker controlled industries, ""is at the heart of the project in Rojava and the goal for an autonomous <a href="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>."" They also affirm that they recognize the struggle against all forms of <a href="kyriarchy">kyriarchy</a> and support the ongoing revolution in the region. Later in the same text they compare the <a href="Chiapas%20conflict">Chiapas rebellion</a> with Rojava, saying that ""Rojava seeks to move beyond the traditional nation-state model that is the impetus behind most national liberation struggles"."

House on Willow Street (also known as From a House on Willow Street) is a 2016 South African horror film directed by Alistair Orr. It stars <a href="Sharni%20Vinson">Sharni Vinson</a>, Steven Ward, Zino Ventura, and Gustav Gerderner as kidnappers who find that their target, played by Carlyn Burchell, has been possessed by a demon. It premiered at the <a href="London%20FrightFest%20Film%20Festival">London FrightFest Film Festival</a>.

Plot.
Hazel, her boyfriend Ade, Ade's cousin James, and Mark plot to kidnap diamond heiress Katherine within the next six weeks. The expedited time frame worries Mark, who believes it may cause them to make mistakes. Hazel and Ade are adamant about the time frame, as Ade will soon go on trial for the accidental death of his brother George. They stress the importance of both the timing and the need for a flawless execution. Left with no other option, Mark agrees. Six weeks later, the four break into Katherine's house, encountering no resistance and finding the alarm already deactivated. After grabbing Katherine, they return to their headquarters in an abandoned warehouse and chain up Katherine. They are surprised by her dirty and sickly appearance but continue with their plan regardless.

Katherine warns them to let her go free and initially refuses to play along in making a ransom video. Hazel convinces her by promising the ordeal will end faster if she cooperates. However, the kidnappers can not contact her parents to make their demands. Hazel sends Ade and James back to Katherine's house to investigate. Less distracted, they realise the house is full of decaying food and smells horrible. James finds two dead, mutilated priests in cellar, and Mark realises that Katherine's parents have been gruesomely murdered. Both are haunted by apparitions from their past. Worried they will be blamed for the murders, they flee the house after grabbing videotapes from the cellar. On the way back, Ade swerves to miss an apparition of George, and James is assaulted by his dead mother.

Back at the warehouse, Hazel and Mark are also haunted. Hazel sees her own dead mother, and Mark sees his dead daughter Sarah. James' condition steadily deteriorates, and the others leave him in a room to rest while they watch the videotapes. The first videotape is by Katherine and details the history of her house and its many unexplained deaths, including that of Hazel's mother. The others are annoyed that Hazel kept this detail quiet, but they continue watching. On the next videotape, a priest says a demon that feeds on grief is responsible for the deaths and has subsequently possessed Katherine. The demon has chosen this house because it is the furthest point in the world from a holy relic kept in the Vatican. Panicked by the demon's growing power, the priests attempt to immolate Katherine, but she kills everyone in the house.

Disturbed by the videotapes, Hazel, Ade, and Mark confront Katherine, who, as the demon, reveals that she only needs to possess two more people to be set free from hell. James, infected by his mother's apparition, attempts to infect the others. Katherine appeals to Mark, telling him that if he betrays Hazel and Ade, she will spare his soul and allow him to be with Sarah again. Mark frees Katherine from her chains and delivers the others to her. After hearing their anguished cries, he sacrifices himself to give them time to escape and becomes infected. Haunted by guilt, Ade attempts to reason with George's apparition, to no avail. He helps Katherine escape the warehouse and, to prevent himself from becoming the final possession the demon needs, Ade kills himself.

The apparition of Hazel's mom helps guide her to freedom. The possessed Katherine, Mark, and James chase Hazel, who retreats to Ade's crashed van. There, they nearly infect her, but she fights them off. Hazel recovers a lighter from the van and traps Katherine in chains they used for the kidnapping. As Katherine works to free herself, Hazel's mom appears and destroys Mark and James. Remembering the priests wanted to immolate Katherine to stop the demon, Hazel incapacitates Katherine, douses her in gasoline, and sets the van afire. Hazel flees the scene as sirens approach.

Piano Trio No. 42 (Haydn)

<a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Joseph Haydn's</a> <a href="Piano%20Trio">Piano Trio</a> No. 42 in E-flat major, Hob. XV/30 was completed in 1796 and first published in Vienna by Artaria in 1797.

The trio is in three movements: 


The first movement's broad opening theme is stated in piano, accompanied by arpeggiated fragments in the strings. This develops into a variety of thematic ideas, including a gently lilting violin melody, before the exposition reaches the dominant key, B-flat major. The second half of the exposition includes a minor-mode episode in which another quietly flowing theme is introduced, giving way to rapid sixteenth-note figuration. The development section presents several unexpected harmonic turns before the home key is reached again. The second movement, in the fairly remote key of C major, involves an alternation between a slow, stately dance and a more animated middle section with a lyrical melody. The movement closes on the dominant, lending an element of surprise to the sudden onset of the lively triple-time finale, back in E-flat major. The opening theme of this movement traces a chromatically rising line, and the frequent up-beat accents lend a quirkiness to the rhythm. Like the first movement, this one contains numerous harmonic surprises.

Function.
This gene encodes a member of the sestrin family of stress-induced proteins. The encoded protein reduces the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species induced by activated Ras downstream of RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt) and FoxO transcription factor. The protein is required for normal regulation of blood glucose, insulin resistance and plays a role in lipid storage in obesity. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Sarah, Lady Pennington

Sarah, Lady Pennington, née Moore (?-1783), was an English noblewoman and the author of a widely read and much reprinted book on conduct for young women.

Biography.
Born Sarah Moore, she was married to Sir Joseph Pennington (ca. 1718-1793), 4th Baronet, of <a href="Warter%20Priory">Warter Hall</a> in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, who was a commissioner of customs. Their marriage deteriorated, and after a dozen years their private disagreements turned into a public scandal when the couple separated. At this period divorce was very difficult to obtain in England, requiring a costly <a href="Local%20and%20personal%20Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">private Act of Parliament</a>, and even mutually agreed separations were highly stigmatized. Lady Pennington moved to <a href="Bath%2C%20England">Bath</a>, leaving her children with their father, who appears to have entirely cut her off from any further contact with them. Although she had received no formal education, she wrote a popular manual of conduct for young women, "An Unfortunate Mother's Advice to Her Absent Daughters; in a Letter to Miss Pennington" (1761). Its first sentence offers her rationale for writing the book: "My Dear Jenny: Was there any Probability that a Letter from me would be permitted to reach your Hand alone, I should not have chosen this least eligible Method of writing to you."

Most unusually, Lady Pennington combined the traditional form of the social conduct manual with a defense of her decision to leave her marriage. While it is clear that she considered her husband greatly to blame, she took responsibility for her own actions and argued that in such situations a woman's right to follow her conscience is more important than blind obedience to marriage vows. She succeeded in escaping the censure usually leveled at women in broken marriages and became instead an object of public sympathy; for example, an obituary in the "Gentleman's Magazine" referred to her "severe and uncommon afflictions". Her book was frequently reprinted, going through three editions in the first year alone, and it continued to appear in various editions and in anthologies well into the 19th century.

Lady Pennington published two other pieces of writing, "Letters on Different Subjects" (1766) and "The Child's Conductor" (1777).

John Cockram

John Cockram (active 1713-1718, last name also Cockrem) was a pirate, trader, and pirate hunter in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, best known for his association with <a href="Benjamin%20Hornigold">Benjamin Hornigold</a>.

History.
Cockram was among a group of pirates active in the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> including Benjamin Hornigold, <a href="John%20West%20%28pirate%29">John West</a>, and <a href="Daniel%20Stillwell">Daniel Stillwell</a> who attacked Spanish ships and others from small open boats such as the <a href="periagua">periagua</a>. On his 1713 cruise he and his small crew “brought back Asian silks, copper, rum, sugar, and silver coins stolen from Spanish vessels off <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and elsewhere” worth over £2,000. Fed up with Cockram and the other pirates disrupting island trade, Deputy Governor Thomas Walker of the Bahamas tried to put a stop to the piracies, arresting Daniel Stillwell; Hornigold freed him and threatened Walker not to intervene.

After his stint of piracy at sea Cockram became a trader, bringing in goods from <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charles Town</a> and other settlements to trade with the pirates in and around <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a>. In March 1714 he married the daughter of another Bahamian trader and pirate supplier, Richard Thompson, and moved to <a href="Eleuthera">Eleuthera</a>. He set up business with Thompson on <a href="Harbour%20Island%2C%20Bahamas">Harbour Island</a>. Cockram and Thompson sailed their own trading vessels such as the "Richard and John", buying and selling with the pirates directly, and also acted as go-betweens for merchants from <a href="Curacao">Curacao</a>, <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, and elsewhere.

The pirates operating out of the Bahamas generally left the traders’ ship alone, as they depended on Cockram, Thompson, and others to import ammunition and other provisions. Thompson and Cockram became “the leading black market traders of the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Piracy">Golden Age of Piracy</a>,” despite continuing threats of <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> intervention and Spanish retaliation. <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George</a> offered a pardon to all pirates who surrendered by September 1718; Hornigold, Stilwell, Cockram, and others accepted. <a href="Charles%20Vane">Charles Vane</a> refused the pardon, escaping <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a> in a hail of cannonfire. One of the first vessels he looted was Cockram’s "Richard and John", marooning its captain, Cockram’s brother Joseph. Another brother, Philip, had been forced into service by the Spanish as a navigator, and on his release warned of increased Spanish aggression.

Bahamas Governor <a href="Woodes%20Rogers">Woodes Rogers</a> tasked the reformed Hornigold and Cockram with retrieving Vane and other lapsed pirates. Vane’s fleet was too strong for them to capture, but they succeeded in apprehending <a href="Nicholas%20Woodall">Nicholas Woodall</a>’s sloop "Wolf", which had been smuggling supplies to Vane. After their success against Woodall, Rogers sent them out again and this time they captured <a href="John%20Auger">John Auger</a>. Cockram’s activities afterwards are not recorded, and he may have returned to his trading and his home on Eleuthera.

Words and Music (Canadian TV series)

Words and Music is a <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> television game show that aired over the <a href="CTV">CTV</a> network during the 1966-1967 season. The show was created by bandleader <a href="Sammy%20Kaye">Sammy Kaye</a> and hosted by American television personality <a href="Jim%20Perry%20%28television%20personality%29">Jim Perry</a>, who later went on to host "<a href="Card%20Sharks">Card Sharks</a>" and "<a href="Sale%20of%20the%20Century">Sale of the Century</a>" in the 1970s and 1980s. The show was produced from the studios of CFCF-TV in Montreal and Perry regularly commuted from his home in New York to host the show.

Gameplay.
The object of the game was for contestants to guess a mystery subject which was the name of a person, place, or thing through a series of musical clues. The show's organist George Fiala played a medley of three songs, all of which shared a common word in their title. For example, the medley of songs might be "Blue Moon," "Blue Skies," and "Blue Moon of Kentucky" so the common word is "blue." Once a contestant guessed the correct word, it was placed in a crossword puzzle on the game board. Another set of three songs was played and game play continued in the same manner with each new clue word placed on the crossword puzzle as it was guessed. All of the crossword puzzle words served as clues to the mystery subject. The first contestant to identify the subject won the game.

Broadcast.
"Words and Music" aired Monday-Friday from 3:00-3:30 PM over the <a href="CTV">CTV</a> network and was host Jim Perry's second television game show. Perry called "Words and Music" "a very static show" and that it was probably too complex of a game for most viewers to follow. The show was cancelled after only one season. Perry then moved over to host his first American game show "<a href="It%27s%20Your%20Move">It's Your Move</a>" which aired in syndication during 1967.

<doc id="54763018" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54763018" title="The Kemetic Order of Aset Ka">
The Kemetic Order of Aset Ka

The Kemetic Order of Aset Ka, also known as just House Aset or just Aset Ka, is a left-hand path <a href="Vampire%20lifestyle">vampire cult</a> originating in <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. Claiming to be descendants of vampiric priests and worshipers of the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian">Ancient Egyptian</a> goddess <a href="Isis">Isis</a>, known as Aset in the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20language">Ancient Egyptian language</a>, the cult made its appearance in 2007 with the publication of its primary text, "The Asetian Bible". It is one of the newest and most extremist of the vampire cults that have appeared since the espousal of the vampire lifestyle and the <a href="New%20Age%20movement">New Age movement</a>. The Order ranks at roughly an 84 on the Advanced Bonewits Cult Danger Evaluation Frame, or "ABCDEF" as it's commonly known, for its elitist and exclusionist beliefs.

The Order details its belief in <a href="psychic%20vampirism">psychic vampirism</a>, a New Age <a href="occult">occult</a> belief in human beings capable of parasitically leeching off a perceived "<a href="life%20force%20energy">life force energy</a>" radiated by other human beings. This energy has never been scientifically proven to exist, and is considered <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>. The Order, through its various publications, teaches its adherents that they are the spiritual children of Isis, the ancient Egyptian goddess of wisdom, who vampirically blessed the priests of her temple through an act called the "Dark Kiss", thus turning them into <a href="vampires">vampires</a> during an age referred to as Sep Tepy, which roughly translates to "first days" in ancient Egyptian. The Order calls itself an Egyptian <a href="mystery%20school">mystery school</a>, and alleges to teach members to become psychic vampires similar to those from other, older, more distinguished vampire groups such as House Kheperu, founded in 1991, and Ordo Strigoi Vii, founded in 1996. Interestingly, both Aset Ka and Kheperu are Egyptian-based vampire cults, and Kheperu was the first order to introduce the concept of what is referred to as the "Triumvirate", a <a href="caste%20system">caste system</a> used to distinguish vampire <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">magical</a> adepts ("priests"), life-force energy conduits ("concubines"), and ritual masters ("warriors").

According to the Order's account given within its "sacred" texts, it was established during a mystical, <a href="Pre-dynastic%20Egypt">pre-Dynastic period</a> of Ancient Egypt referred to as Sep Tepy, or the "first days." It was established by members of the Isis cult who were "turned" by the goddess into immortal vampires. The Order states that it is an, "elitist secretive society," whose knowledge cannot be found outside its own publications, similar to older vampire cult "Temple of the Vampire". The books themselves are known to be written by Luis Marques, an enigmatic individual who actively avoids public scrutiny. Members of the Order, called "Asetians" or "Asetianist", are known to be elitist, radical and hostile towards other vampire cults and orders and their members, and view "immortal prince" Marques as a <a href="deified">deified</a> or <a href="Personality%20cult">messianic</a> figure.

In reality, the Order lacks any central authority or structure, instead relying on adherents to purchase Asetian texts in order to further their magical evolution and attain vampiric <a href="Enlightenment%20%28spiritual%29">enlightenment</a>. From within, the Order claims to be controlled by the descendants of its purported immortal Asetian priests, although none have ever come forward publicly.

History.
The Order first appeared in 2007 with the publication of "The Asetian Bible", the cult's central text. Like many other New Age and occult orders, the Order shrouds its history in legend and myth, creating a mystical and supernatural narrative explaining its origins and development. According to their own publications, the Order is descended from ancient Egyptian vampires, who were "turned" by the goddess Isis by a secretive technique called the Dark Kiss.

Beliefs & structure.
The Order of Aset Ka describes itself as a, "spiritual society and metaphysical order of mysteries," founded by the Egyptian goddess Isis in pre-Dynastic Egypt. However, it is one of the least known and least respected of the vampire orders within the <a href="esoteric">esoteric</a> spiritual branch of the vampire lifestyle due to its radical elitism. Similar to other vampire cults such as Ordo Strigoi Vii, Temple of Azagthoth and the Temple of the Vampire, the Order teaches that their method of psychic vampirism and related practices are the only right and true path, and that practitioners of other esoteric vampire paths are deluded and fraudulent, although the methods they propose are similar to those put forward by other, older vampire cults and orders. Members of the Order are interchangeably called Asetians or Asetianists, and they regard author Luis Marques and the unidentified Children of Aset as <a href="Messiah">messianic</a> figures, writing hymns to Marques and aggressively confronting those who challenge him, the Order or their doctrines. A fictitious sect called the Red Children of <a href="Set%20%28deity%29">Set</a> are regarded as enemies.

Organization & hierarchy.
The Order of Aset Ka possesses no structure beyond what it published within their texts, and it is primarily left to the adherent to follow the texts and practice the <a href="metaphysical">metaphysical</a> arts within them.

Clinton was born as Prince Somayou Zea Clayou in 1865 or 1866 in <a href="Grand%20Bassa">Grand Bassa</a> where he was heir to the throne of his grandfather, Zea, the king of the Bassa, a large tribe of two million people in West Africa. Somayou's father was also a king and Somayou's mother was his favorite wife. A rival uncle was seeking the throne, but Somayou was being trained secretly to be a successor until his father died in 1878. Fearing for his life, Somayou fled to the Liberian coast and met an American trader named Clinton, who taught Somayou English. Somayou then was introduced to an Episcopal bishop along the road between <a href="Cape%20Palmas">Cape Palmas</a> to <a href="Cape%20Mount">Cape Mount</a>. The bishop, Lewis Penick, was on his way to found a mission station and Somayou worked with the bishop for five years and adopted the name "Lewis Penick Clinton."

In 1884 seeking to further his education, Clinton came to the U.S. and studied at <a href="Storer%20College">Storer College</a> in <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> for five years starting in the 1880s. By 1890 Clinton had moved to <a href="Maine">Maine</a> where he completed one year at <a href="Nichols%20Latin%20School">Nichols Latin School</a> and then attended <a href="Bates%20College">Bates College</a> and its affiliated <a href="Cobb%20Divinity%20School">Cobb Divinity School</a> for six years. He graduated from <a href="Bates%20College">Bates College</a>'s <a href="Cobb%20Divinity%20School">Cobb Divinity School</a> in 1897 with high honors. While at Bates, Clinton was active member of the Polymnian debating society and active in social events and sports, including tennis, and he wrote for the "<a href="Bates%20Student">Bates Student</a>". He paid for his education expenses through lecturing and writing. Clinton acquired knowledge of many languages including English, French, German, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, <a href="Bassa%20language">Bassa</a>, <a href="Kru%20languages">Kru</a>, and <a href="Vai%20language">Vai</a>. In 1898 Clinton was ordained as a Free Will Baptist minister, and he returned to Africa in 1899 to found a mission near Fortsville in Grand Bassa, Liberia helping to educate local men and women and to hopefully regain the throne from his uncle. His mission work was sponsored by the Free Will Bapists in Maine, and Clinton founded a mission station and farm (seventy-five miles east of Monrovia and fifty miles from the coast) upon several hundred acres of land granted by the Bassa people and Liberian government, and he was later assisted by another Storer alumnus, Rev. A.K. Peabody. The mission grew to contain dormitories and farms, and in addition to the native Bassa children, many <a href="Americo-Liberians">Americo-Liberians</a> also sent their children to his school. In 1910 Clinton temporarily returned to the United States to lecture about his work, including a talk the Baptists at <a href="Ocean%20Park%2C%20Maine">Ocean Park, Maine</a> and another at <a href="Clark%20University">Clark University</a> in Massachusetts entitled "The Hinterland of Liberia."

Plot.
Tancred Palmieri is a 20-something year old professional thief living in Toronto. Over the course of several years he meets and befriends Willow Azarian who eventually confesses to him that she is the heiress of a billionaire businessman. Upon his death Willow's father bequeathed roughly a billion dollars to her and her four other siblings, however Willow also believes that there is even more of the family fortune left behind. She bases this belief on several bizarre mementos her father also left to each of the siblings. Willow cannot persuade her other siblings to join her in this belief so she asks Tancred to steal the mementos so that she will be able to privately examine them to find the location of the hidden money. To convince Tancred that she is not crazy Willow shows him her memento: a replica of Willows by the Uji Bridge with one panel removed and a small plaque on which the words "salix babylonica" are inscribed. Tancred agrees to take the job from Willow, but after she rents him an apartment and pays him for the job she dies of pneumonia.

Tancred begins to steal the mementos belonging to the other Azarian siblings. Unfortunately for him, some of the siblings go to the police and detective Daniel Mandelshtam who is Tancred's best friend since childhood, is assigned to the case. 

At the same time several other people are involved in the hunt. Willow's former drug dealer Errol Colby, who Willow had told of her theory, also clumsily tries to partner with Tancred to find the supposed fortune. The artist who designed four of the pieces, Alexander von Würfel also becomes interested in the case after Willow, and later detective Mandelshtam, visit him to inquire about the nature of the pieces. He eventually makes contact with Tancred who offers him 10% of whatever Willow's share was in order to convince him to let him see replicas of the siblings pieces which von Würfel has recreated to help him figure out the mystery.

As Tancred continues to steal the Azarians mementos he comes into contact with a few of them, all of whom reveal to Tancred that the clues are easily solvable and lead to a mausoleum in a cemetery dedicated to the Weiden's a close knit family whom their father had always wanted them to emulate. Despite this clue, Tancred continues with his quest. 

Tancred eventually realizes that a clue in Willow's memento seems to hint that he should be looking for the hidden name Harfen (German for Harp) among the Weiden's in the mausoleum. He is successful and finds an envelope and key with instructions to a bank in <a href="Montreux">Montreux</a>. Before he goes he leads Errol and his associate Freud, to the mausoleum letting them find the secret drawer where he has left instructions to the Bank of Canada where he has left several precious gems he has stolen. He allows Errol and Freud to "steal" the bank information from him. Before he leaves for <a href="Montreux">Montreux</a> however, Errol is arrested as he went directly to a jeweler who quickly ascertained the gems had been stolen. In revenge Freud tries to shoot Trancred who attacks him in a surge of adrenaline resulting in Freud falling down a flight of stairs and breaking his neck. Tancred feels deep remorse for this action. Nevertheless he heads to <a href="Montreux">Montreux</a> where he discovers that Willow's father had indeed left each sibling an additional 100 million dollars. In a letter he tells Willow to distribute the money as she sees fit. For awhile Tancred is unsure what to do, however he ultimately decides to return to Toronto, disclose everything to his friend Daniel Mandelshtam, give the siblings their share of the money, and fight back if they try to prevent him from claiming Willow's share as she had ultimately bequeathed it to him.

Ualarai

The Ualarai were an <a href="indigenous%20Australian">indigenous Australian</a> people of New South Wales.
Language.
"Ualarai" was a <a href="Wiradhuric%20languages">Wiradhuric tongue</a> It has been classified as a dialect ("Yuwaalaraay")) of <a href="Gamilaraay%20language">Gamilaraay</a> by <a href="Robert%20M.%20W.%20Dixon">Robert M. W. Dixon</a>. The Ualarai distinguished various kinds of Gamilaraay, telling Mrs <a href="K.%20Langloh%20Parker">K. Langloh Parker</a>:
"With us, Byamee the name is not derived from the verb to make-which is "gimberleegoo"; maker, "gimberlah"--this word is also used in the <a href="Gamilaraay%20people">Kamilaroi tribes</a>, some of which are within a hundred and fifty miles of us. But the Kamilaroi that Ridley knew are some three and four hundred miles away, so the language is sure to have variations; our Euahlayi language has only a few of the same words as the Kamilaroi..

Country.
Ualarai country was rather dry even over winter, which permitted a longer gathering and conservation of seeds as a food resource.
Social organization.
The Ualarai were organized in terms of matrilineal descent. 
Economy.
The were proto-agriculturalists, who exploited the grasslands of their area, harvesting foods for storage, a practice (called generically "konakandi" or 'dung food') also found among several other tribes such as the <a href="Iliaura">Iliaura</a> and <a href="Wadjari">Wadjari</a>. The surplus was stored ("yarmmara", storage) in caves, enabling women to free up their time, since the existence of reserves relieved them of the need to gather in edible foodstuffs every day.

Both sexes worked at the harvest. The women would cull the grass heads with their ears, still green, so they could be stacked within a brushwood enclosure that was then set alight. The seeds were winnowed by stirring through the heap with long sticks, and gathered on opossum skins. Then the men took over as threshers, separating the husks by alternately beating and then stamping the seeds laid in two holes, on rectangular the other circular. The refined product then underwent further purifying by employing "wiri" or bark dishes, and "jubbil." The resulting seedstock was then packed in skin bags, Once taken out of storage, the seeds were prepared by grinding then, with additions of water, on "dajuri" millstones and cooking the cakes over ashes. Milling was also done with a nether millstone, "jamara," a word that also meant the milled seed itself.
<a href="Eucalyptus%20microtheca">Coolibah</a> eucalypts yielded branches that were piled on hard ground and left to dry until they yielded up their seed which was then milled.

Mythology.
Reports on Aboriginal belief system often drove controversies over whether indigenous Australians understood the nature of conception or whether they recognized a supreme deity, one of the criteria for the kind of civilization Western colonialism promoted. Some maintained they did, in subscribing to a belief in <a href="Baiame">Baiame</a>. <a href="Andrew%20Lang">Andrew Lang</a> asked Mrs Parker what the Ualarai view was in regard to this. She was told that their word for the 'All-Seeing Spirit' was "Nurrulburu," and for the 'All-Hearing', "Winnanulburu." As for "Baiame," ("Byamee") it meant a "burul euray"' (big man), one with totem names for every part of his body, down to each finger and toe. On his departure he distributed his totem attributes to all, which they would take from their mother, so that marriage was interdicted for people with the same mother (totem). He dwelt in his sky camp with his son "Bailah Burrah." he had an earthly subordinate "Gayandi" who was a ceremonial overseer to the mysteries of tribal initiation.
