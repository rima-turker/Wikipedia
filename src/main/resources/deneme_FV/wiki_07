Typhoon Janis (1992)

Typhoon Janis, known in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> as Typhoon Gloring, was an early-season typhoon that struck Japan during August 1992. An area of disturbed weather formed near <a href="Pohnpei">Pohnpei</a> in late-July 1992, and after an increase in thunderstorm activity, and on August 3, a tropical depression developed. After tracking near <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, Janis tracked generally westward, and on August 5, the storm was believed to have attained typhoon intensity. After intensifying at a brisk pace, Janis attained peak intensity on August 6 near <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. Thereafter, the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate as it recurved towards <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, where it made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on the next day. Land interaction took its toll on the typhoon as it tracked northeast, paralleling the western coast of <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a>. On August 9, Janis transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical low</a> over <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>.

Five fishing boats sank offshore <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, where one fisherman was killed, and six others were listed missing. Typhoon Janis was the second of two consecutie systems to move over the Japanese archipelago, with <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Irving%20%281992%29">Tropical Storm Irving</a> proceeding it. Nationwide, twelve fatalities were reported and another was initially reported as missing. Sixty-seven others sustained injuries. A total 1,561 houses were destroyed while 1,508 others were flooded. In addition, 47 ships and were damaged. Strong winds and torrential rains resulted in 350,000 customers losing power. An eight-hour suspension of high speed rail to <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> stranded over 20,000 people at <a href="Hiroshima%20Station">Hiroshima Station</a>. Greater than 80 domestic flights in <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> were canceled, leaving an estimated 45,000 travelers stranded. Damage was estimated at 74 billion yen ($584 million <a href="United%20States%20Dollar">USD</a>).

Meteorological history.
The tropical disturbance that would later mature into Typhoon Janis formed near <a href="Pohnpei">Pohnpei</a> in the eastern <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> towards the end of July 1992. At 06:00 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> on July 30, the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) started tracking the system. Increased convective development led to the issuance of a <a href="Tropical%20Cyclone%20Formation%20Alert">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a> at 13:00 UTC on August 2. Intensification continued through the morning hours, and at 00:00 UTC, the JTWC issued the first warning on Tropical Depression 10W, with the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) following suit at the same time. At 14:39 UTC, a <a href="Hurricane%20hunter">Hurricane hunter</a> aircraft was able to identify a well-defined center as well as winds of . Passing near <a href="Guam">Guam</a> and moving into the <a href="Philippine%20Sea">Philippine Sea</a>, the depression organized further and was upgraded to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC on August 3 by both the JTWC and JMA. At around this time, the <a href="Philippine%20Atmospheric%2C%20Geophysical%20and%20Astronomical%20Services%20Administration">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and <a href="List%20of%20historical%20tropical%20cyclone%20names">assigned it with the local name</a> "Gloring". Midday on August 4, the JMA classified Janis into a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Western%20Pacific">severe tropical storm</a>. Six hours later, Janis was declared a typhoon by the JTWC, with the JMA doing the same at 00:00 UTC on August 5. According to the JTWC, Janis entered a period of <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapid deepening</a>, intensifying during the day of August 5. At 00:00 UTC on August 6, the JTWC increased the intensity of the storm to 215 km/h (130 mph), equivalent to a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the United States-based <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Wind%20Scale">Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale</a>. Operationally, the storm was believed to have attained winds 230 km/h (145 mph), based on <a href="Dvorak%20technique">Dvorak estimates</a> from <a href="polar%20orbit">polar orbiting</a> satellite imagery. However, in post-storm analysis, the JTWC determined that due to the high resolution of the satellite, the <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye temperature</a> of the storm was overestimated, prompting the agency to revise its Dvorak methods to better match intensity estimates derived from <a href="geostationary%20satellites">geostationary satellites</a>.

After tracking towards the west-northwest during its early stages, Typhoon Janis turned towards the north-northeast and passed east of <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. The JTWC estimated that Janis leveled off in intensity. However, the JMA estimates that Janis was still strengthening, and did not attain its highest intensity until 18:00 UTC on August 6, when the agency reported winds of and a <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of . After its peak intensity, the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate as it recurved towards <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>; this turn was correctly predicted by the JTWC. At the time of landfall on Kyushu late on August 7, the JTWC and JMA estimated winds of and respectively. Over <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, land interaction took its toll on the typhoon, and the JTWC and JMA downgraded Janis to tropical storm intensity on August 8. The tropical storm moved to the northeast, paralleling the western coast of Honshu. At noon on August 9, Janis transitioned into an extratropical low over <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>. It was lasted noted by the JMA around noon on August 13 near the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a>.

Martin Luserke

Martin Luserke (3 May 1880 in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> – 1 June 1968 in <a href="Meldorf">Meldorf</a>, <a href="Holstein">Holstein</a>, Germany) was a <a href="Progressive%20education">progressive</a> <a href="Pedagogy">pedagogue</a>, a <a href="bard">bard</a> and <a href="writer">writer</a>. He was one of the leading figures of German <a href="progressive%20education">progressive education</a> and a precursor of <a href="outdoor%20education">outdoor education</a>. As his distinguished achievement counts the integration of <a href="community%20theatre">community theatre</a> into school and <a href="youth%20work">youth work</a>. It was also integrated in <a href="German%20Youth%20Movement">German Youth Movement</a>.

Family and Youth.
He was one of three sons of the construction expert Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Luserke (1851–1931) and his wife Amalie Elisabeth Luserke (* 1855), née Lindhorst. She originated from <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>, whereas the Luserke family originated from <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a>, <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>. Both were <a href="Pietism">Pietists</a>.

During his childhood Martin Luserke got the chance to become acquainted with the <a href="Port%20of%20Hamburg">port</a> of <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, the river <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> and the German coast along the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. Via <a href="sailboat">sailboat</a> and <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a> he got to know the <a href="East%20Frisian%20Islands">East Frisian island</a> <a href="Spiekeroog">Spiekeroog</a> and <a href="Heligoland">Heligoland</a> in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>. According to his mother's memoirs he very early felt attracted to the Sea.

Starting at the age of ten he read works by <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>, a bit later those written by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, both comprehensively and passionately. Reportedly he had his first contact with a stage at <a href="Schauspielhaus%20Berlin">Schauspielhaus Berlin</a> where he watched the drama "<a href="William%20Tell%20%28play%29">William Tell</a>" by Schiller. The play fell short of his high expectations so he was badly disappointed. Later this experience might have been an influence on his own conceptions of theatre works.

In the age of fifteen he broke with his family. The catalyst was a moment when his mother burnt his Shakespeare books which he had read secretly.

In 1908 he married Annemarie Gerwien (1878–1926). He met her through his work for "<a href="Freie%20Schulgemeinde%20Wickersdorf">Freie Schulgemeinde Wickersdorf</a>" (= Free School Community Wickersdorf) where she worked as a <a href="matron">matron</a>. She was the daughter of <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n <a href="Oberstleutnant">Oberstleutnant</a> (= Lieutenant Colonel) Paul Vincent Gerwien (see "<a href="Wallace%E2%80%93Bolyai%E2%80%93Gerwien%20theorem">Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem</a>"). The couple got four children, one girl and three boys: Ursula (* 1910), Klaus (* 1912), Heiner (* 1914) and Dieter (* 1918). Between 1938 and 1968 Auguste Schwarting became Luserke's companion.

Education.
He became a pupil of the <a href="Moravian%20Church">Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine</a> in Berlin. When he was fifteen his parents sent him to "Herrnhuter Lehrerseminar" in <a href="Niesky">Niesky</a>, <a href="Lusatia">Lusatia</a>, to become a teacher. Between 1900 and 1904 he worked as an elementary teacher at "Pädagogium Niesky". There he got estranged from Pietism which he found cold-hearted. He moved to <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a> and studied <a href="Mathematics">Mathematics</a> and <a href="Philosophy">Philosophy</a> at "<a href="University%20of%20Jena">Friedrich Schiller University Jena</a>".

In 1905 he made a field excursion to <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, where he hiked for several months through the remains of <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> culture of <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a>. Via the lecture of a <a href="bard">bard</a> on the island of <a href="Mol%C3%A8ne">Molène</a> he got inspired to use <a href="Oral%20tradition">oral</a> and <a href="Recorded%20history">written tradition</a> like <a href="myths">myths</a>, <a href="saga">saga</a>s and <a href="legend">legend</a>s for his own work. He also travelled to Italy and Egypt.

He got influenced by his academic teachers, the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> winner <a href="Rudolf%20Christoph%20Eucken">Rudolf Christoph Eucken</a>, <a href="Ernst%20Haeckel">Ernst Haeckel</a>, <a href="Wilhelm%20Rein">Wilhelm Rein</a> and later by <a href="Hermann%20Lietz">Hermann Lietz</a>. Luserke's ideas about an idealized lifelike education to develop an attitude can be traced back to them. With their pupils Luserke and Zuckmayer went on tour through major German cities like Berlin, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> or <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> to perform on stages where they got very positive critics in the newspapers. <a href="Heinrich%20Karl%20Ernst%20Martin%20Meyer">Heinrich Meyer</a> started his career at "Schule am Meer", <a href="Beate%20Uhse">Beate Uhse</a> and <a href="Felicitas%20Kukuck">Felicitas Kukuck</a> belonged to its pupils.

The school created a botanical garden right in the <a href="dunes">dunes</a> of the <a href="sandbank">sandbank</a> and developed eleven <a href="Kitchen%20garden%23Vegetable%20garden">vegetable gardens</a> for self-supply. In the school's workshops detailed <a href="ship%20model">ship model</a>s were built as well as <a href="seakeeping">seakeeping</a> <a href="sailboat">sailboat</a>s (<a href="dinghy%20cruisers">dinghy cruisers</a>) but also parts to built up wooden <a href="shack">shack</a>s. Its sports programme included <a href="gymnastics">gymnastics</a> and cold baths in the sea, <a href="Sport%20of%20athletics">athletics</a>, <a href="boxing">boxing</a>, <a href="fistball">fistball</a>, <a href="association%20football">association football</a>, <a href="handball">handball</a>, <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a>, <a href="ice%20skate">ice skate</a>, <a href="prisonball">prisonball</a> and <a href="sailing">sailing</a>.

When Luserke's renowned school was closed in spring 1934 due to <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> "<a href="Gleichschaltung">Gleichschaltung</a>" (= Nazification) and <a href="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a> he decided to work as a free writer.

"Krake" ZK 14.
In the Netherlands he bought the old Dutch fishery vessel "ZK 14" which he named "<a href="Krake%20ZK%2014">Krake</a>" (= octopus). Henceforward he deployed it as his swimming poet's workshop to sail the shallow waters of the coastal regions of The Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Southern Norway and Southern Sweden. In the harbours he opened his ship for taletelling and readings. Mostly young people visited his ship, some attended during trip sections. One of the later well-known listeners and passengers was <a href="Beate%20Uhse">Beate Uhse</a>, one of his former pupils.

Meldorf, Holstein.
At the end of 1938 he went off board to settle in <a href="Meldorf">Meldorf</a>, <a href="Holstein">Holstein</a>. There he continued his work as a free writer.

His most successful books were published during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1935 he got awarded with "Literaturpreis der Reichshauptstadt Berlin" (= literature award of <a href="German%20Reich">Reich</a>'s capital Berlin) for his historic novel "<a href="Hasko%20%28novel%29">Hasko</a>" which was published in German, Dutch and French. Several of his books were also printed for army postal service of German <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> (army and navy) during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Luserke cannot be described as toeing the Nazi party line. Instead his ideal and book topics were in some extent similar to <a href="V%C3%B6lkisch%20movement">Völkisch movement</a>. His literary work was mostly fiction with a revival of <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, <a href="Brittany">Breton</a> legends and <a href="Continental%20Germanic%20mythology">Continental Germanic mythology</a> so it contains no Nazi propaganda. Nevertheless it matched some popular Völkisch and Nazi topics which was convenient during dictatorship to get accepted as a professional writer.

Between 1947 and 1952 he got a teaching assignment at "<a href="Meldorfer%20Gelehrtenschule">Meldorfer Gelehrtenschule</a>" (founded in 1540) where he introduced his community theatre again. There he named his fully developed play as "Meldorfer Spielweise". Along the way his most appreciated activities helped to save the school's survival which was endangered after WWII.

He died in the age of 88 and got buried in <a href="Hage">Hage</a>, East Frisia, next to his wife Annemarie.

<doc id="54814744" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54814744" title="Foxdale Mines">
Foxdale Mines

The Foxdale Mines is a collective term for a series of mines and shafts which were situated in a highly mineralised zone on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, running east to west, from Elerslie mine in <a href="Crosby%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Crosby</a> to <a href="Niarbyl">Niarbyl</a> on the coast near <a href="Dalby%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Dalby</a>.In the <a href="19th%20Century">19th Century</a> the mines were widely regarded as amongst the richest ore mines in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>.

History.
Origins.
The origin of mining in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> is not recorded, however there is evidence of workings at <a href="Bradda%20Head">Bradda Head</a> dating from ancient times.
Ore had been extracted by a method referred to as <a href="Plug%20and%20feather">plug and feather</a> or ""feather wedges,"" which indicates that the workings date from before the introduction of <a href="gun%20powder">gun powder</a> into <a href="Europe">Europe</a>.

The first recorded mining operation was in <a href="1246">1246</a>, when <a href="Norsemen">Norse</a> Kings ruled the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, and <a href="Haraldr%20%C3%93l%C3%A1fsson">King Harald II</a> granted a charter to the <a href="Furness%20Abbey">monks of Furness Abbey</a>.

By the mid <a href="19th%20Century">19th Century</a> the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> was one of the leading <a href="lead">lead</a> producing districts in <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a> and more <a href="zinc">zinc</a> was produced from the Island's mines than all the mines in Britain combined.

Operation.
Workings in the area of <a href="Foxdale">Foxdale</a> date from <a href="1724">1724</a> when <a href="Lord%20Derby">Lord Derby</a> granted permission for the extraction of <a href="ore">ore</a> to begin.
Initial results were somewhat mixed but work continued spasmodically until in <a href="1848">1848</a> when it is reported that 400 miners were in the employ of the mines and had uncovered a great mass of <a href="ore">ore</a> which could be easily extracted.Output continued to increase;3,753 tons of <a href="lead%20ore">lead ore</a> yielding 2,725 tons of lead was mined on the Island in 1856 of which Foxdale Mines contributed 2,535 tons generating a profit of £11,200. For the same period profit from the <a href="Great%20Laxey%20Mine">Great Laxey Mine</a> amounted to £1,000. In 1875 11,898 tons of <a href="zinc%20blende">zinc blende</a> was extracted, in <a href="1877">1877</a> 186,019 <a href="ounce">ounces</a> of <a href="silver">silver</a> and by <a href="1891">1891</a> the produce of the Foxdale Mines amounted to £45,200. 
By <a href="1892">1892</a> several <a href="Lode">lodes</a> were being worked.
These extended for approximately 2-3 miles, one yielding a substantial deposit of <a href="silver">silver</a> and another a sizable amount of very rich <a href="lead%20ore">lead ore</a>.

Near these mines, known as the New Foxdale Mines, several shafts were sunk by prospectors, but while some <a href="lead">lead</a> was found it soon petered out, and they were abandoned.

There was also a group of mines in the valley known as the Old Foxdale Mines.
These contained the Flappy Vein and were worked until <a href="1888">1888</a>. Also situated nearby was the Louisa Mine, however this was only worked for a short period of time before it was found to be uneconomical. A shaft was also sunk at East Foxdale which returned a substantial yield up until <a href="1889">1889</a> by which time it was worked out.

The mines continued to achieve a profit throughout the remainder of the <a href="19th%20Century">19th Century</a>, although the amount declined in part due to a stagnation in the price of ore.
In 1900 the ore risings for the year amounted to 3,610 <a href="ton">tons</a> yielding a profit of £10,800 an increase of £2,000 on the 1899 operation and producing a dividend of 7.5%. 

Closure.
During the first <a href="decade">decade</a> of the <a href="20th%20Century">20th Century</a> the yield from the mines began to decline significantly and by 1910 the sale of ore was failing to cover the expenses of coal, labour and other sundries.Indeed so acute had the situation become that the directors of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Mining%20Company">Isle of Man Mining Company</a> decided on stopping the operation unless the men agreed to a reduction in wages. 

Despite the men accepting reduced terms and conditions yield continued to dramatically reduce, and in April 1911 a decision was taken by the directors to wind up the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Mining%20Company">Isle of Man Mining Company</a>.
An extraordinary general meeting was held by the directors at the Law Association Rooms, Cook St, <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on the evening of Thursday April 6, 1911 at which a liquidator was appointed for the purpose of voluntary winding up the Company. 

The <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Mining%20Company">Isle of Man Mining Company</a> ceased operations at <a href="Foxdale">Foxdale</a> on Friday July 28, 1911.

The mines were not closed because they were worked out, but rather because by the early <a href="20th%20Century">20th Century</a> it had become cheaper to import ore from <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="Australia">Australia</a> than to mine it at considerable depths. The Beckwith Shaft which was sunk in <a href="1849">1849</a> had by the time of closure yielded 50,000 tons of <a href="lead%20ore">lead ore</a> with a value of £750,000 and had been worked to a depth of 230 fathoms equating to .Extraction from such depths, with the infrastructure required, was not economically viable.

Re-opening.
Although none of the mine workings were re-opened, in <a href="1955">1955</a> it was thought that re-processing the spoil from the mines could extract a further yield of ore. A company, Metalliferous Holdings Ltd, had been formed and was already in the process of undertaking such work at the old <a href="Snaefell%20Mine">Snaefell Mine</a>. The new company employed 22 men in the undertaking working around the clock. Spoil residue was transported from Foxdale to the company's flotation plant where it was tipped into an automatic sieve and in turn fed into an 80 ton <a href="Ball%20mill">Ball mill</a> which the company had sourced from the <a href="Gold%20Coast%20%28region%29">Gold Coast</a>. The process saw the spoil crushed by <a href="steel">steel</a> balls and chemicals and then passed on to the flotation tanks where it was conditioned by more chemicals, automatically skimmed, and finally dried off into powder. 

The venture was an initial success with the result that a Canadian mining company, Amanda Mines Ltd, proposed a merger with Metalliferous Holdings Ltd. An audit had found that approximately 400,000 tons of lead-zinc spoil was situated at the former pit heads at <a href="Laxey">Laxey</a> and <a href="Foxdale">Foxdale</a>. At the end of May <a href="1956">1956</a> Amanda Mines took over Metalliferous Holdings Ltd with Metalliferous Holdings becoming a subsidiary of Amanda Mines. The operation yielded £60,000 in 1956.Production ceased in July 1958 as a consequence of a fall in the price of lead.

Beckwith Mine.
The Beckwith mine derived its name from William Beckwith. The area where the mine was situated was immensely rich in deposits - 600 tons of ore being recovered before a shaft was sunk.

In time over 50,000 tons were extracted which realised approximately £750,000 for the mining companyand resulted in great prosperity to the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>.
It was as a result of this discovery that the <a href="Manx%20Northern%20Railway">Manx Northern Railway</a> was founded, and operated mineral trains from <a href="Foxdale">Foxdale</a> to <a href="Ramsey%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Ramsey</a>, where the trains ran along the quayside in order to unload their contents into ships.On the return journey the trains would haul <a href="coal">coal</a> to power the pumping houses of the mine shafts.

The Bristol, West of England and South Wales Operatives Trade and Provident Society was a <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> representing labourers in parts of England and Wales.

The union was founded in 1873 by T. M. Kelly and within a year claimed 10,000 members. However, this figure was disputed, with the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> claiming that it had little more than 1,000 members at this time. Either way, it saw growth as by the end of the century it had 25,450 members and 247 branches, making it the second largest union for labourers in the UK, after the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Gas%20Workers%20and%20General%20Labourers">National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers</a>. The small Amalgamated Corporation Employees Union (Bristol) merged in at this time.

The union's membership peaked at 49,301 in 1910, and it then slowly declined, with most of the dock workers in the union transferring to the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Dock%2C%20Riverside%20and%20General%20Workers%20in%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">National Union of Dock, Riverside and General Workers in Great Britain and Ireland</a>. In 1935, it still had 35,104 members, but it appears to have collapsed around 1937.

Chertkovo railway station

Chertkovo railway station () is a railway station located in <a href="Chertkovo%2C%20Rostov%20Oblast">Chertkovo</a>, <a href="Rostov%20oblast">Rostov oblast</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. It is 325 km down-line from <a href="Rostov-Glavny">Rostov-Glavny</a> and is situated between Zorinovka and Sheptukhovka on the Moscow — Rostov-on-Don line. The station is located at the <a href="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> border just opposite to the Ukrainian village of <a href="Milove">Milove</a>.

History.
The station was being laid on 14 August 1869 with the construction of the south section of the <a href="South%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28Russia%29">South Eastern Railway</a> near the border between <a href="Don%20Host%20Oblast">Don Host Oblast</a> and <a href="Kharkov%20Governorate">Kharkov Governorate</a>. The station named for ataman Mikhail Chertkov who petitioned to construct this railway. Village of <a href="Chertkovo%2C%20Rostov%20Oblast">Chertkovo</a> was founded due to construction of the self-named railway station.

In 1873 the second class station Chertkovo had an one-store stone station building, one passenger and two cargo platforms, locomotive depot for 12 steam locomotives, reservoir for water, two stone and eight wooden constructions, bathhouse, laundry and other warehouses. Buffets, bookstall and newsstand worked on the station. The railway line was fully equipped with the latest technology. <a href="Wireless%20telegraphy">Wireless telegraphs</a> of the Markoni Company were exploited in Chertkovo. In the early 1900s Chertkovo was a small workers settlement where there were a church, drinking establishment and bunkhouse. At that time construction began of a hospital. Chertkovo had only one secondary school and college.

The opening ceremony of the bust of Mikhail Chertkov took place at the square front of the station in August 2009. The event was held in conjunction by the 140-year anniversary of Chertkovo.

Services.
Chertkovo is the terminal for long-distance and suburban trains operated by <a href="Russian%20Railways">Russian Railways</a>. The most common destinations are: Rostov-on-Don, Moscow, <a href="Adler">Adler</a>, <a href="Novorossiysk">Novorossiysk</a>, <a href="Anapa">Anapa</a>, <a href="Kislovodsk">Kislovodsk</a>, <a href="Yeysk">Yeysk</a>, <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, <a href="Stavropol">Stavropol</a>, <a href="Sukhumi">Sukhumi</a>, <a href="Vladikavkaz">Vladikavkaz</a>.

The Zhuravka — <a href="Millerovo">Millerovo</a> Railway bypassing the Ukrainian territory was become operational in August 2017. The decision was taken against the background of the conflict in Ukraine to ensure security of passengers and cargo transportation. Long-distance trains will stop running through the station in this connection.

Johannine script

Johannine script (<a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>: "letra joanina") was a <a href="Palaeography">historical style of handwriting</a> used in the <a href="Chancery%20%28medieval%20office%29">Portuguese Royal Chancery</a> starting around the reign of <a href="John%20I%20of%20Portugal">King John I</a> (1385–1433) that was used until the reign of <a href="Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal">King Manuel I</a> (1495–1521). It is, thus, a national variation of <a href="chancery%20hand">chancery hand</a>, a form of <a href="blackletter">blackletter</a>.

Johannine script is essentially curvise, with a short <a href="x-height">corpus size</a> (but with long <a href="Ascender%20%28typography%29">ascender</a>s and <a href="descender">descender</a>s), letters slope slightly to the right, words are clearly separated one from the otherm with no ligatures, <a href="punctuation">punctuation</a> is mostly absent, and <a href="Arabic%20numerals">Arabic numerals</a> are not used (instead, numbers are given in full, or in <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numerals</a>). The shape of the letters "v" and "b" (and Roman numeral 5) are practically indistinguishable. Abbreviations are commonplace, mostly marked with an <a href="overline">overline</a> and/or <a href="superscript">superscript</a>.

The prevailing script in documents from (and from the land that would eventually become) Portugal from the 8th to the 12th centuries was <a href="Visigothic%20script">Visigothic script</a>; from the mid-12th century onwards, for about a century, <a href="Carolingian%20minuscule">Carolingian minuscule</a> and, later on, an incipient <a href="Gothic%20alphabet">Gothic script</a>. From 1385 onwards, that is, after <a href="John%20I%20of%20Portugal">John I</a> was crowned putting an end to the <a href="1383%E2%80%931385%20Portuguese%20interregnum">Portuguese Interregnum</a>, there is radical change in the writing style of the documents issued by the Royal Chancery: this new script (first called "Johannine script" by paleographer Eduardo Borges Nunes) has influences of the French "<a href="Bastarda">lettre bâtarde</a>" and Gothic scripts.

Notable scribes who wrote mostly on Johannine script include Álvaro Gonçalves (fl. 1385-1401), Gonçalo Caldeira (fl. 1386–1426), and João de Lisboa (fl. 1388-1431).

History.
In 1958 the Mennonites moved to Belize from Mexico, searching a country of freedom. Not long after that they started raising hens and marketing eggs countrywide. At first they sold the eggs at <a href="Farmers%20Trading%20Center">Farmers Trading Center</a> but then in 1997 they split up and started a separate company Country Foods.

In 2014 a disease invaded the country and thousands of hens were slaughtered, raising the egg price. Then on a windy day at 1500 on Feb. 10, 2016 an employee lit the trash near the building. The flames rose high into the air and the breeze carried sparks into the building igniting a huge flame. The Spanish Lookout Fire Department and BNE water trucks battled the flames until nightfall. By the time the fire was contained all the warehouse and it's contents had been burnt and destroyed.

Bomvana

The Bomvana people, also called AmaBomvana, are a <a href="Southern%20African">Southern African</a> ethnic group. Their traditional homeland has been in Elliotdale, in the Transkei region of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The name AmaBomvana translates to “the red ones” so named after the red and orange ochre they cover their faces in. Large portions of the Bomvana people currently reside in the district of Elliotdale in the Transkei region between the Umtata and Mabse Rivers, in a region that has rolling hills, meadows, rivulets and rivers where bushes and trees grow.

Language.
The Bomvana people are a Bantu speaking group of people who form a part of the southern Nguni, including the Xhosa, Mpondo, Fingo, Ngqika, Baca, and others. They speak <a href="isiXhosa">isiXhosa</a> a language which is spoken by more than 3.9 million South Africans. The languages of the AmaBomvana, AbaTembu and AmaMpondomise speakers are closely related to the standard variant of Xhosa. The AmaBomvane intermarried with the San and Khoi people at an earlier stage and this can be picked up in their language that has various clicks.

Origins.
According to their own tradition, the Bomvana people originated from the Amanguema, a people from Kwa-Zulu Natal. The AmaBomvana are descended from Nomafu, the first of the AmaNgwana tribe and from Bomvu, who gave rise to the AmaBomvu tribe. Bomvu's Great Son, Nyonemnyam, carried on the Bomvu dynasty. His son Njilo is the progenitor of the AmaBomvana. The AmaBomvana people left Natal in 1650 to settle in <a href="Pondoland">Pondoland</a> after a dispute over cattle. After the death of Njilo’s wife, their grandson Dibandlela refused to send, in accordance with custom, the isizi cattle to his grandfather. This led to an open dispute. Dibandlela fled with his supporters and their cattle to settle in <a href="Pondoland">Pondoland</a> 

The AmaBomvana remained in <a href="Pondoland">Pondoland</a> until 1837. After experiencing two centuries of tribal wars, the amaBomvana were driven out of <a href="Pondoland">Pondoland</a> into the area east of the Mbashe river, including the present-day Cwebe reserve and they put themselves under the wing of the <a href="Gcaleka">Gcaleka</a> people with permission from the amaXhosa chief, <a href="Hintsa">Hintsa</a>.

They are historically related and share a common lineage with the AmaMpondomise, AmaXesibe, AbakwaMkhize, AmaBomvu and AmaMpondo as they all have related cultural similarities. The passing of four centuries since their division and the influence of neighboring tribal groups have brought about the linguistic and cultural differences, and differences in their rituals and rites of passage that we observe today.

Agriculture and Husbandry.
The Bomvana people are pastoralists and agriculturists, breeding a type of cattle they consider sacred called Bolowana Cattle or Izankayi. Bolowana cattle are used for ploughing and other draft purposes. The possession of land and cattle, for example, is necessary for full participation in the social and religious life of the tribe.

After their migration from Kwa-Zulu Natal Bomvana people remained affluent across the Mbashe river, because their chief, Ntshunge, had refused to participate in the prophecy of <a href="Nongqawuse">Nongqawuse</a>, the Xhosa prophetess whose prophecies led to a millennialist movement that culminated in the <a href="history%20of%20the%20Cape%20Colony%20from%201806%20to%201870%23Xhosa%20cattle-killing%20movement%20and%20famine%20%281854-1858%29">Xhosa cattle-killing movement and famine (1854–1858)</a>. While most of the other Xhosa tribes suffered famine because of this prophecy they had obeyed, the Bomvana people grew their cattle and farmed their lands.

After the turn of the century subsistence for the AmaBomvane people and other groups living around the Mbashe river became more problematic. Two waves of cattle disease, in 1897 and 1910, decimated the herds of the Bomvana and plunged them into poverty and dependency.

The Bomvana tribe have been said to have traded tobacco and cannabis with the Amapondo and other Xhosa speaking tribes for metal 

Early Education.
Education had effectively split the Amabomvana into two groups: the “red” illiterate people and the “school”. The red people, or amaqaba, continue to paint themselves with red ochre and are classified as educated in traditional ways and the “school” people, or "amaqhobhoka”, are people who have left traditional life and are usually Christians and educated in Western ways.

In 1878, the countryside which the AmaBomvana occupied was involved in a war and Moni, the chief of the Bomvanas, was unable to maintain neutrality so applied to be received as a British subject. The high commissioner accepted his offer, and took possession of the district surrounding the Mbase River, called Elliotdale, and brought the area under the British flag, ensuring the protection of the AmaBomvana. In the aftermath of the annexation of the Transkei in the 1890s, measures to disempower the traditional leaders and extend the authority of the colonialists brought dislocation to the societies, which mostly depended on traditional leadership like the Bomvana and the Gcalecka.

Similarly, the impact of migrant labour during the <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> years has withhdrawn from their tribal society and mobilised men between the ages of 18-50 for the labour market.

Beliefs.
Among those who maintain traditional beliefs, religion, ancestor worship and herbal medicine have a close relationship. The Bomvana feel themselves totally dependent upon their own ancestors in all the vital aspects of life: procreation, cattle and other property, as well as in the well-being of the family. According to the Bomvana, UThixo (God) existed from the very beginning and emerged from the sea. UThixo was the first ancestor from whom the people originated.

He was known for his wooden, painted <a href="Wood%20carving">carvings</a> of birds mounted on <a href="driftwood">driftwood</a>.

Life and work.
Peltz was born in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany, New York</a> in 1915. He attended <a href="Hotchkiss%20School">Hotchkiss School</a>, and graduated from <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> in 1938, later returning to Yale to earn a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a> degree in history. During his time at the university, Peltz was a member of <a href="the%20Whiffenpoofs">the Whiffenpoofs</a> singing group. Peltz served in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">US Navy</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, in both the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean</a> and <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific theaters</a>, rising to the rank of <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>. It was during his time in the Navy that he carved his first bird. 

After leaving the Navy, Peltz married and had two children. In 1952, Peltz and his family moved to East Sandwich. In 1958 Peltz had a barn moved from <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Falmouth, Massachusetts</a> to <a href="East%20Sandwich%2C%20Massachusetts">East Sandwich</a>, where he began to carve and sell his birds, nicknaming the structure "The Bird Barn."

In total, Peltz is believed to have crafted thousands of birds, and his works continue to regularly come up at auction, generally selling between $100-$200. Due to the large number of pieces, the quality of Peltz's work varies from very fine, detailed sculptures which capture the shape and posture of the birds to those with less attention to detail, and "fastness of color." Peltz carved and painted a variety of birds, from <a href="Anseriformes">waterfowl</a> to <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, with most of his subjects being species present in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>.

The first attempt to form a trades council in Bristol was in 1868, when the Council of Amalgamated Trades was created. However, by the following year, this had become part of the Board of Trades Delegates, a group focused on encouraging workers to vote for the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a>, and even this had dissolved by 1871.

By 1873, most large cities in the UK had a trades council, and in January, John Cawsey assembled a group of trade unionists at the Cock and Bottle pub on <a href="Castle%20Park%2C%20Bristol">Castle Green</a>, where they founded the Bristol Trades Council. Initially, fifteen <a href="craft%20union">craft union</a>s were affiliated, but their total membership was less than 3,000, and this figure changed little until 1890. The focus on craft exclusiveness excluded unskilled workers. Despite this, and its early insistence on remain neutral between the Liberal and <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> parties, it began featuring in the city's public life, for example, by nominating a member to a committee to investigate the position of the poor people in the city. In 1885, it founded a local Labour League, to support trade unionists standing for public office. This was immediately successful, as John Fox of the <a href="Bristol%2C%20West%20of%20England%20and%20South%20Wales%20Operatives%20Trade%20and%20Provident%20Society">Bristol, West of England and South Wales Operatives Trade and Provident Society</a> was elected to the <a href="School%20Board">School Board</a>, while in 1887, R. G. Tovey was elected to <a href="Bristol%20City%20Council">Bristol City Council</a>.

The <a href="new%20unionism">new unionism</a> of the 1890s was supported by the trades council, and many new unions affiliated during the 1890s, taking total membership to around 10,000. During this period, it supported a wide variety of industrial action, and convinced the city council to pay its workers at union rates. It affiliated to the <a href="Labour%20Representation%20Committee%20%281900%29">Labour Representation Committee</a>, and became the body organising <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> activity in Bristol until 1918. It suffered divisions during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, with <a href="Walter%20Ayles">Walter Ayles</a> leading opposition to the war, while <a href="Frank%20Sheppard%20%28trade%20unionist%29">Frank Sheppard</a> and <a href="William%20Whitefield">William Whitefield</a> led support for it. After extended debates, it decided to oppose conscription.

Although the Labour Party had split its political activity from trades councils in 1918, the following year, the trades council agreed to merge with the new Bristol Borough Labour Party, forming the Bristol Trades and Labour Council, with a full-time secretary for the first time. In 1921, it created the Bristol Unemployed Association to direct the existing movement of unemployed workers away from militant activity and towards joint campaigns with trades unions. Several other trades councils were inspired to create similar organisations, and in 1932 the <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">Trades Union Congress</a> took over responsibility as part of a national scheme modeled on the Bristol example.

The council co-ordinated local activity during the <a href="UK%20general%20strike">UK general strike</a>, and although it had made no advance plans, its round-the-clock sessions and system of cycle messengers were deemed a success.

Leopold Hirschfeld

Leopold Hirschfeld (, 1798, <a href="Bonyh%C3%A1d">Bonyhád</a> - 1893, <a href="P%C3%A9cs">Pécs</a>), was <a href="Hungarian%20people">Hungarian</a> <a href="Hungarian%20Jews">Jewish</a> brewer in <a href="P%C3%A9cs">Pécs</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="Habsburg%20Empire">Habsburg Empire</a>. He founded in 1848 the <a href="P%C3%A9csi%20S%C3%B6rf%C5%91zde">Pécsi Sörfőzde</a>.

Life.
Leopold Hirschfeld was born in <a href="Bonyh%C3%A1d">Bonyhád</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> where he was dealing with grain trade and later learnt brewering. In the 1840s he moved to <a href="P%C3%A9cs">Pécs</a>, <a href="Baranya">Baranya</a> with the aim to set up there his own brewery. At that time there were several breweries in <a href="Baranya">Baranya</a>. They worked in guilds with the permission of the responsible city council, but could produce just in little amounts despite a growing demand.

Leopold bought the small brewery of the hospital of Pécs in 1848 and transformed it into a big beer manufacture during the 1850s. It became the first brewery in the whole region which successfully implemented the greatest technical achievements of this time, especially the use of produced ice. The factory's young and ambitious chemist "Emanuel Kristian Scharbach" developed that new brewering technology which brought the company great success.

The first official recognition came on the 40th anniversery of the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201848">Hungarian Revolution of 1848</a> "General Exhibition of Pécs" ("Pécsi Általános Kiállítás") where the company was awarded with a golden prize for its beer. After this period came temporary stagnation, because beers from <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="Pest">Pest</a> and <a href="Graz">Graz</a> became more popular in the region. For the popularization of the local beers in the 1870s <a href="Zsolnay">Zsolnay</a> introduced its own <a href="beer%20mug">beer mugs</a> which helped the local brewering companies for a short time. 

Then in 1887 an epidemy of <a href="phylloxera">phylloxera</a> appeared on the grapefields in the <a href="Mecsek">Mecsek Mountains</a>. Until 1889 most of the grapefields of the historical wine region were destroyed. This was a tragic incidence which changed the consumption habits of the residents. People started to drink more beer and less wine which boosted the beer production and consumption in the region.

As long as the two big breweries of Pécs, the one of Scholz produced annually 5000 hectoliter and the one of Hirschfeld made 4000 hectoliters, by 1891 the production jumped up to 15 000 hectoliters together. The factory exported beer to its main export markets, to <a href="Slavonia">Slavonia</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Bosnia">Bosnia</a> and <a href="Fiume">Fiume</a>. But it was not enough so new, third big brewery appeared on the market in 1893, the "Agricultural Brewery & Steammill Co." ("Mezőgazdasági Sörgyár és Gőzmalom RT.") whose owner was the son of Gyula Scholtz, the owner of the "Scholtz Brewery" who started his own business. 

Leopold saw the adventages of the strong rivals so he established a high quality beer garden of German and Austrian examples for his beer products. He called it "Abbázia" and it had a covered and an open-air part where thousands of people could spend their spare time drinking and talking. The locals loved the beer garden because it offered them a metropolitan feeling and there was enough space for revelry and charity ceremonies.

Personal life.
His son, Sámuel Hirschfeld was born in 1844/1843 in <a href="Bonyh%C3%A1d">Bonyhád</a>. 

Death.
Leopold Hirschfelder died in 1893 in <a href="P%C3%A9cs">Pécs</a>. 

Legacy.
His son, Sámuel Hirschfeld inherited the brewery who renamed it as "Pannonia Brewery" ("Pannónia Sörfőzde") and improved its beers with clearer water from deeper wells. After the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> it became the only functioning brewery of <a href="P%C3%A9cs">Pécs</a>.

Alandi (horse)

Alandi (foaled 4 April 2005) is an Irish-bred <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> racehorse and <a href="Horse%20breeding%23Terminology">sire</a>. He was a slow-maturing horse who did not race as a two-year-old and made only one (winning) appearance at three. As a four-year-old he established himself as one of the best staying racehorses in the world with victories in the <a href="Vintage%20Crop%20Stakes">Vintage Crop Stakes</a>, <a href="Ballycullen%20Stakes">Ballycullen Stakes</a>,<a href="Irish%20St%20Leger">Irish St Leger</a> and <a href="Prix%20du%20Cadran">Prix du Cadran</a>. He was then sold to race in Australia as a <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a> prospect but failed to reproduce his European form. A return to Europe in 2012 saw no improvement and he was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Poland.

Background.
Alandi is a bay horse with a large white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">star</a> and three white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Leg%20markings">socks</a> bred in Ireland by his owner <a href="Aga%20Khan%20IV">Aga Khan IV</a>. The colt was sent into training with <a href="John%20Oxx">John Oxx</a> at <a href="Kilcullen">Kilcullen</a> in <a href="County%20Kildare">County Kildare</a> and was ridden in all of his early races by <a href="Mick%20Kinane">Mick Kinane</a>.

He was sired by <a href="Galileo%20%28horse%29">Galileo</a>, who won the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Derby</a>, <a href="Irish%20Derby">Irish Derby</a> and <a href="King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20Stakes">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes</a> in 2001 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. Galileo's other progeny include <a href="Cape%20Blanco%20%28horse%29">Cape Blanco</a>, <a href="Frankel%20%28horse%29">Frankel</a>, <a href="Nathaniel%20%28horse%29">Nathaniel</a>, <a href="New%20Approach">New Approach</a>, <a href="Rip%20Van%20Winkle%20%28horse%29">Rip Van Winkle</a>, <a href="Found%20%28horse%29">Found</a>, <a href="Minding%20%28horse%29">Minding</a> and <a href="Ruler%20of%20the%20World">Ruler of the World</a>. Alandi was one of several winners produced by the broodmare Aliya who won two of her eight races including the <a href="Oyster%20Stakes">Oyster Stakes</a> in 1997. She was a full sister to Aliysa who finished first in the Epsom Oaks and was the granddam of <a href="Alamshar">Alamshar</a>.

Racing career.
2008: three-year-old season.
Alandi did not race as a juvenile and began his track career in a <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> over one and a half miles on <a href="Going%20%28horse%20racing%29">heavy ground</a> at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh Racecourse</a> on 20 October 2008. Starting the <a href="Fractional%20odds">6/4</a> favourite against twelve opponents he made steady progress in the straight, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and three quarter <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a> from Street Legal.

2009: four-year-old season.
Alandi's first run of 2009 saw him stepped up to Listed level for the Vintage Crop Stakes at <a href="Navan%20Racecourse">Navan Racecourse</a> on 26 April in which he started at odds of 4/1 behind the reigning champion stayer <a href="Yeats%20%28horse%29">Yeats</a>. After racing towards the rear of the eight runner field he took the lead approaching the final furlong, drew clear of the field and won by three and a half lengths from Hindu Kush despite being eased down by Kinane in the final strides. Four weeks later at <a href="Leopardstown%20Racecourse">Leopardstown</a> Alandi started odds-on favourite for the <a href="Saval%20Beg%20Stakes">Saval Beg Stakes</a> but after some trouble in running he was beaten a length by Hindu Kush with <a href="Sublimity%20%28horse%29">Sublimity</a> in third.

A month after his defeat in the Saval Beg, the colt returned in the <a href="Curragh%20Cup">Curragh Cup</a> on 27 June and was made the 9/4 second choice in the betting. He raced in third place but struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight before finishing strongly to take second place beaten a neck by the five-year-old mare Profound Beauty. In the Listed <a href="Challenge%20Stakes%20%28Ireland%29">Challenge Stakes</a> at Leopardstown in July he was in contention for most of the way but looked outpaced in the closing stages and finished fifth of the six runners behind Profound Beauty. Despite three consecutive defeats, Alandi started odds-on favourite when he contested the Listed Ballycullen Stakes at <a href="Fairyhouse">Fairyhouse</a> on 22 August. He took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and pulled clear of the field to win "very easily" by five lengths from his stablemate Aliyfa.

In the Irish St Leger at the Curragh on 12 September Alandi started the 3/1 second favourite behind <a href="Godolphin%20Racing">Godolphin Racing</a>'s multiple <a href="Group%20race">Group 1</a> winner <a href="Schiaparelli%20%28horse%29">Schiaparelli</a>. Profound Beauty an Yeats were again in opposition whilst the best-fancied of the other four runners was the <a href="Fred%20Archer%20Stakes">Fred Archer Stakes</a> winner All The Aces. Schiaparelli set the pace with Alandi settled behind the leaders before moving up into second place in the straight. Alandi overtook the favourite just inside the final furlong and held off a persistent challenge from the British filly Clowance to win by half a length. Schiaparelli finished third, five lengths behind Clowance and eighteen lengths ahead of Profound Beauty in fourth. After the race John Oxx said "Mick had fancied him for this race for a while - he always said to me if it was soft he would take some beating. One mile, six furlongs is the bare minimum for him as he's a real grinder. I was happy to see him come off the bridle as early as he did because Mick said afterwards they went a hell of a gallop on such soft ground."

For his final run of the year Alandi was sent to France and stepped up in distance for the <a href="Prix%20du%20Cadran">Prix du Cadran</a> over 2400 metres at <a href="Longchamp%20Racecourse">Longchamp Racecourse</a> on 4 October. The Prix Gladiateur winner Kasbah Bliss (also a top class <a href="Hurdling%20%28horse%20race%29">hurdler</a>) started favourite with Alandi on 5/1 and other fancied runners being Yeats, Incanto Dream (<a href="Prix%20Maurice%20de%20Nieuil">Prix Maurice de Nieuil</a>) and Askar Tau (<a href="Doncaster%20Cup">Doncaster Cup</a>). Kinane positioned his mount just behind the leaders and turned into the straight in third place behind Yeats and Incanto Dream. Alandi went to the front 300 metres from the finish and hung on to win by a short head from the fast-finihing Kasbah Bliss. Oxx commented "He's a good horse, very genuine and now goes on all types of ground. Mick has always said two things - one, that on heavy ground he could win the Irish St Leger, two, that when he tackles extreme distances he could be a <a href="Ascot%20Gold%20Cup">Gold Cup</a> candidate. He was spot on with his assessment".

In the <a href="2009%20World%20Thoroughbred%20Rankings">2009 World Thoroughbred Rankings</a> Alandi was given a rating of 119, making him the 65th best racehorse in the world and the second best horse in the Extended distance division.

2010 – 2012: later career.
Before the start of the 2010 season Alandi was sold to <a href="Lloyd%20Williams%20%28businessman%29">Lloyd Williams</a> and sent to race in Australia where he was trained by <a href="Robert%20Hickmott">Robert Hickmott</a>. His record in Australia was very disappointing as he finished last or last-but-one in all five of his starts. Williams had hoped that the horse would be a major contender for the <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a> but admitted "I just haven't been able to get him going at all. He's not half the horse he was when John Oxx was training him".

In 2012 Alandi was returned to Europe and joined the stable of P J Prendergast in Ireland. He returned to the track at <a href="Goodwood%20Racecourse">Goodwood Racecourse</a> in August 2012 but failed to recapture his old form as he finished tailed-off last in the Listed <a href="March%20Stakes">March Stakes</a>.

Stud career.
After his retirement from racing Alandi began his stud career in 2014 at the Millennium Stud in <a href="Strzegom">Strzegom</a>, Poland.

Description.
"Latenivenatrix" can be distinguished by other troodontids thanks to the following diagnostic (autapomorphic) traits residing in the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a>: 

- The pubis is retroverted forming a 17° angle;

- The pubic shaft is anteriorly curved;

- A large muscle scar on the lateral surface of the pubic shaft is present, slightly proximal to the pubic boot (this is seen also in dromaeosaurid "<a href="Hesperonychus">Hesperonychus</a>" and raises doubts since "Hesperonychus" is also from the Dinosaur Park Formation).

Other diagnostic traits that further distinguish "Latenivenatrix" from other derivate troodontids are:

- The triangular shape of each frontal bone which also does have a single deep groove in the frontonasal contact surface;

- A concave anterior surface of metatarsal III. While this trait is clearly absent in other derived troodontids such as "<a href="Saurornithoides">Saurornithoides</a>", "<a href="Talos">Talos</a>", "<a href="Urbacodon">Urbacodon</a>" and "<a href="Stenonychosaurus">Stenonychosaurus</a>" too, it appears to be present in "<a href="Philovenator">Philovenator</a>" as well and not clearly verifiable in several species.

Phylogeny.
"Latenivenatrix" was found to be a derived troodontid (part of the newly-defined <a href="Troodontinae">Troodontinae</a>), probably related to coeval Asian forms such as "<a href="Linhevenator">Linhevenator</a>" and "<a href="Philovenator">Philovenator</a>".

Paleobiology.
"Latenivenatrix" is the largest troodontid known, with a maximum total body length estimated to 3.5 m (11.5 ft). As a derivate troodontid, it was probably a semi-omnivorous bipedal with loss of the skills of a primitive flyer. Its ecological role was probably distinct from that of "<a href="Stenonychosaurus">Stenonychosaurus</a>", the other smaller kind of troodontid known from the same formation. The two species can be distinguished by abovementioned morphological differences.

Paleopathology.
A parietal bone catalogued as TMP 79.8.1 bears a "pathological aperture". In 1985 Phil Currie hypothesized that this aperture was caused by a cyst, but in 1999 Tanke and Rothschild interpreted it as a possible bite wound. One hatchling specimen may have suffered from a <a href="congenital%20defect">congenital defect</a> resulting in the front part of its jaw being twisted.

Bloomberg Billionaires Index

The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world's richest people. The index debuted in March 2012 and tracks the net worth of the 500 wealthiest people on the planet. It draws information from "action in the stock market, economic indicators and news reports," features a profile of each billionaire, and includes a tool that allows users to compare the fortunes of multiple billionaires. The index is updated every day at the close of trading in New York.

Launch and Background.
Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world's billionaires published by <a href="Bloomberg%20News">Bloomberg News</a> since March 2012. It tracks the 500 wealthiest people in the world. The ranking was designed to provide a more transparent and accountable presentation of the world's biggest personal fortunes. At first, the index only tracked the 20 richest people in the world, and then expanded to 100, 200, 400 and later 500 in October 2016. 

At its launch in 2012, Mexican telecommunications tycoon <a href="Carlos%20Slim">Carlos Slim</a> was in the top spot, with an estimated $65.8 billion net worth. However, since May 2013, <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> co-founder <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a> has been the world's top billionaire. <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a> CEO <a href="Jeff%20Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> and Spanish fashion retailer <a href="Amancio%20Ortega">Amancio Ortega</a> have both seen a large increase in their respective net worths during 2016 and 2017 and are challenging Gates for the number one spot.

The Index reported on hidden wealth and uncovered more than 400 hidden billionaires since its founding. Bloomberg Billionaires founding editor Matthew Miller said in 2013 that hidden billionaires are identified by "making sure that we have accounted for all the companies in closely-held assets around the world." Some of the billionaires the index has uncovered includes <a href="JPMorgan%20Chase">JP Morgan Chase & Co</a> chairman <a href="Jamie%20Dimon">Jamie Dimon</a>, <a href="In-N-Out%20Burger">In-N-Out Burger</a> president <a href="Lynsi%20Snyder">Lynsi Torres</a>, <a href="Ferrari">Ferrari</a> Motors heir <a href="Piero%20Ferrari">Piero Ferrari</a> and the chairman of Biel Crystal Manufactory Yeung Kin-Min.

While reporting on hidden billionaires, the index provides coverage of and attempts to put in perspective the wealth of the world's richest people, such as the Queen of England and U.S. President Donald Trump.

Methodology.
The index offers a dynamic look at the wealth controlled by the world's richest people while trying to offer a new perspective on how the media views and tracks the movement of that wealth. The index "is built to change daily depending on stock fluctuations and economic/company news."

To calculate individuals' wealth, the index relies on a mixture of public and private data, tracking stock prices and publicly disclosed holdings as well as calculated values for private companies using derived or reported information that is valued using live comparisons to public competitors.

The valuations are converted to U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and do not include assumptions about personal debt.

Data visualization.
The full index is available on the <a href="Bloomberg%20Terminal">Bloomberg Terminal</a>, and a user-friendly version designed to appeal to a mass audience is available online for free. There are tools to compare the fortunes of multiple billionaires, track the billionaires whose assets change the most, and analyze the one-year performance of individual billionaires or billionaires grouped by industry, region or nation.

Brooks is a 1,300-acre mixed-use community in the southeast portion of the city of <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Brooks was created in 2001 by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>, the State of <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and the City of <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a> to redevelop the former <a href="Brooks%20Air%20Force%20Base">Brooks Air Force Base</a>. Brooks is intended to be a catalyst for economic development, a dynamic mixed-use community and a model for responsible urban planning and development.

About.
Brooks is home to more than 30 businesses that employ almost 3,000 people at an average salary of $50,000.

Land Use.
The Brooks land use plan applies a clear strategy of land development and resource allocation that achieves a stronger economy and a more unified community.
The plan includes a mix of residential, light-industrial, commercial and retail developments, along with designated parks and green space.
The land use plan breaks the 1,308-acre campus into three districts, each with a unique purpose and character that creates a balance between culture, economy, and ecology. Combined, the three districts offer space for multiple uses and redevelopment.

Development.
The Brooks Development Authority has demonstrated economic development success with projects including a 62-acre (250,000 m2) retail development, approximately 256,000 square feet (23,800 m2) of research and distribution facilities for DPT Laboratories, an international pharmaceutical company, and a $25.5 million City/County emergency operations center which opened in the Fall 2007.
In 2012, the $90 million Mission Trail Baptist Hospital opened; in September 2014, Mission Solar Energy, opened a 240,000 square-foot manufacturing facility employing more than 400 people in San Antonio. The University of the Incarnate Word opened a School of Osteopathic Medicine in July 2017.
In June 2017, Embassy Suites Hotel & Spa by Hilton opened a location at Brooks. Earlier in the year, Brooks completed their renovation of a historic Airplane Hangar. Hangar 9 is the oldest wooden airplane hangar in its original spot. It is now used as an event venue. The Greenline, a 46-acre linear park, will be completed at Brooks in the fall of 2017.

Education.
Residents are zoned to the <a href="San%20Antonio%20Independent%20School%20District">San Antonio Independent School District</a> or <a href="East%20Center%20Independent%20School%20District">East Center Independent School District</a>.
The community includes a STEM-based (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) K – 8 school, Brooks Academy of Science and Engineering. Brooks also offers higher education with Texas A&M-San Antonio and the University of Incarnate Word School of Osteopathic Medicine, which opened July 2017.

Historic Hangar 9.
Brooks started construction, in March 2016, on a rehabilitation and restoration project of the historic Hangar 9 building, built in 1918. The building is the oldest wooden aircraft hangar of its kind still standing in its original location. Hangar 9 is a San Antonio Historic Landmark, listed in the Texas State Historical Survey, the National Register of Historic Places, and is a National Historic Landmark. The $2.8 million project will take approximately one year to complete. The work will provide foundation and structural repairs, electrical upgrades, installation of new windows and doors, painting and siding replacement, new paving and landscaping, and accessibility improvements. The building is available for use to the public for community and business events and special gatherings.

History.
Brooks is a former <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> facility, located in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>. The Air Force ceased military operations on 30 September 2011.
Following the 1995 <a href="BRAC">BRAC</a>, when Brooks AFB was removed from the Base Realignment and Closure list, city, state, military, and community planners began to develop a plan to privatize and approved the gradual transition in ownership of Brooks AFB from the Air Force to the Brooks Development Authority. This transition came into full effect on Jul. 22, 2002, when the Brooks Development Authority assumed control of the newly named Brooks City Base. The Air Force was the largest tenant at Brooks City Base.
In 2002, <a href="Brooks%20Air%20Force%20Base">Brooks Air Force Base</a> was renamed Brooks City Base when the property was conveyed to the Brooks Development Authority as part of a unique project between local, state, and federal government. The Brooks Development Authority is now the owner and operator of the property, and is redeveloping it as a dynamic multi-use community.
In 2017, Brooks City Base changed its name to Brooks to make it clearer that it is no longer a military base. Brooks also wanted to communicate that it is an open community where people can build businesses, live in residential areas, and visit retail and dining facilities.

Namesake.
Brooks Air Force Base was named to honor San Antonio aviator Sidney Johnson Brooks, Jr. Cadet Brooks died on 13 November 1917 when his <a href="Curtiss%20JN-4">Curtiss JN-4</a> nosed down as he prepared to land after his final training flight at <a href="Kelly%20AFB">Kelly Field</a>, Texas, possibly because he had blacked out in reaction to the inoculations they had been given shortly before the flight. Brooks was one of the first to volunteer at the call for men for the American Flying Corps; he was about to complete his training for a commission as a military aviator. He was awarded his wings and commission posthumously.

<doc id="54816781" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54816781" title="Digital casting">
Digital casting

Digital casting is a process that enables both talent and people who solicit and employ talent to fulfill production requirements in the entertainment, corporate, non-profit, art, amateur and marketing industries through the use of on-line, mobile and digital technology 

Digital casting platforms allow talent to create online profiles to solicit opportunities for themselves through the use of a "self tape" regardless of professional representation from a manager or talent agent . Talent profiles generally include photographs, resumes, video reels, voice over reels and detailed accounting of special skills and unique attributes. Many of these platforms, including Actors Access, Backstage, Actors Equity Casting Call, Playbill, Casting Frontier, ModelMayhem, Now Casting and NYCastings have become industry standards and are used to cast talent in television series, feature films and commercials as well as live performances , televised talent competitions , musicals, corporate entertainment and print advertising. 

History.
Though early versions of digital casting platforms began to appear in the late 1990s, the 'revolution' in casting didn't engage until after the start of the 21st Century when audio and video technology improved for general on-line users through open systems and digital recording devices such as cameras and mobile phone image capture technology became widely available and affordable. Advances in uploading speed, image and digital transmitting technology, along with casting specific technology including Cast It Systems and Casting Frontier's iSession applications encouraged the growth and use of online casting from both amateur and professional talent.

In 2008, as a reaction to the arrival of digital casting platforms, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) launched a free and dedicated system called iActor, which was the first union-hosted online casting directory featuring onsite Station 12 cast clearance. While iActor was exclusively available to SAG members, it also enabled AFTRA talent to create profiles .

Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons Art of the In-Between

Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons Art of the In-Between is an art exhibition about the work of fashion designer <a href="Rei%20Kawakubo">Rei Kawakubo</a> and her designs for her fashion house, <a href="Comme%20des%20Gar%C3%A7ons">Comme des Garçons</a>. The exhibition runs from May 4 to September 4, 2017 at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. It was curated by <a href="Andrew%20Bolton%20%28curator%29">Andrew Bolton</a>, who worked closely with Kawakubo to select works for the exhibition. On display are 140 women's costumes span the entirety of her career until 2017. 

Background.
In an interview with "Vogue", Bolton stated that he chose to curate an exhibition of <a href="Rei%20Kawakubo">Rei Kawakubo</a>'s work because "just look at the clothes. They speak for themselves." It took Bolton one year to complete the exhibition. Both Bolton and Kawakubo have stated that the exhibition is not a retrospective of Kawakubo's work, but an exploration of "the in-betweeness" of her high fashion women's wear. It is the first <a href="Anna%20Wintour%20Costume%20Center">Costume Institute</a> exhibition about a living artist since their 1983 exhibition about <a href="Yves%20Saint%20Laurent">Yves Saint Laurent</a>. Kawakubo had originally suggested that the exhibition showcase only works from her most recent, seven collections and that it should have bene called "The Art of the Modernist."

Exhibition design.
The exhibition is designed around seventeen "binary themes" as created by Bolton, with different selections of 140 outfits in each theme:

The space is split into two sections, one that showcases Kawakubo's work from the start of her career in 1979 until 2014, when she stated she would no longer make clothing. The second part is devoted to works from 2015 until 2017. The exhibition does not feature works from the 1970s nor the Curiosity (2007) collection at the request of the artist. 

Visitors follow a pathway which guides them through the different themes, where different costumes are on display. A free, printed brochure is provided in lieu of labels, written by Bolton. The brochure also features quotes from Kawakubo. Kawakubo requested that there be no labels due to her dislike for interpretation.

Reception.
<a href="Roberta%20Smith">Roberta Smith</a>, of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", noted that the variety of works displayed (which she called "swings of sensibility") as "disorienting." However, she appreciated the layout of the exhibition and wrote of it having "playful instability," that complements the eccentric work of Kawakubo.

Traci Rhone

Traci Rhone (born September 25 1975) is a <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>n painter, licensed psychotherapist, and film producer based in Miami, Florida. She is the founder and executive producer of a independent film production company in <a href="Miami">Miami, Florida</a> called Kingston5 Productions. 

Traci Rhone was born and raised in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston, Jamaica</a> to the parents of Trevor D. Rhone and Camella Rhone. Her mom was Miss Universe of Trinidad and Tobago in 1973, and her dad is the famous late playwright and filmmaker <a href="Trevor%20D.%20Rhone">Trevor D. Rhone</a>, who co-wrote the international acclaimed film "<a href="The%20Harder%20They%20Come">The Harder They Come</a>" (1972). Traci Rhone traveled a lot throughout her childhood (<a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> and <a href="London">London</a>) due to her fathers job. She spent much of her childhood in what she would describe a fog, later diagnosed as a severe Attention Deficit disorder and depression. At 16, Rhone wanted to leave Jamaica and wanted to live in the United States. So her final year of high school, she studied very hard in getting good grades, that she got accepted into <a href="Florida%20International%20University">Florida International University</a>.

Originally Rhone wanted to study art, but her father told her it would be a tough lifestyle to maintain a steady income. Instead Rhone majored in Psychology, got her Bachelors in 1996, and has a Masters in Mental Health (2003). Rhone has been a licensed mental health therapist for over 10 years, treating: drug abusers and schizophrenics; and is also a life coach. She began to return to the arts after a series of tragic events in her life, and started painting again. Rhone remembered how much she enjoyed painting and when she was younger, being on set with her father, the whole thrill of producing a film and the production side to it. So it was natural for Rhone to follow the same path as her father of a writer and filmmaker.

On August 1, 2016, Traci Rhone formed Kingston5 Productions an independent film production company in Miami. Kingston5 Productions produces independent films, independent films and documentaries that focus on real people, real stories, and social situations that are often neglected by traditional media outlets.[http://www.tracirhone.com/ <nowiki>[2]</nowiki>] Traci Rhone produces films that are feminist, social & environmental conscious in an effort to remove stigmas within societies and bring communities together.

Rhone lives in Miami, Florida with her eight-year-old daughter Sofia. Rhone also paints and her artwork showcases the same message as her films, in being socially conscious and her art is influenced by surrealism. Her art work has exhibited at the Lowes art festival and can be found at many commercials spaces in Miami.

Hermann Zimmermann (18 November 1897 – 11 January 1978) was a German infantry commander and recipient of the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Major Zimmermann commanded II./Schützen-Regiment 3 during the battle of France. During the latter stages of the battle, on the evening of 14 June, his battalion along with Panzer-Regiment 5 had reached a point approximately 15 km north of the city of St. Florentin. He received an order to capture the city along with its key bridges as soon as possible. Upon hearing favourable intelligence he decided the best strategy was a coup de main, and sent out a reinforced company first. Intermingling with the fleeing refugees and French soldiers they went unnoticed for some time, and when they were recognized opened fire at close range. Despite the mass of vehicles and people that had clogged the roads, and despite Zimmermann himself being wounded in the course of the fighting, his soldiers were able to seize all the bridges intact and held them against counterattacks. The victory was a tremendous one, with Zimmermann’s battalion capturing 112 officers, 2,360 NCOs and enlisted men, over 500 vehicles including 4 tanks and 4 armored cars, 21 various artillery pieces and a depot with six million litres of fuel. For this action Zimmermann was awarded the Knight’s Cross.

Behold the Kickmen

Behold the Kickmen is a <a href="Parody">parodic</a> <a href="Association%20football">football</a> video game developed and published by <a href="Size%20Five%20Games">Size Five Games.</a> It was released on July 20, 2017 for Windows and Mac OS X on the <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> platform.

It received mixed reception from critics, who were highly polarized in their opinions of the game's humor and gameplay.

Gameplay.
The game features a football-like approximation with the rules drastically changed to incorporate some from baseball and basketball. The pitch is round rather than rectangular, players score more if they kick the ball from farther away, the <a href="Goalkeeper">goalkeepers</a> are called "goldkeepers", and the game makes a "mockery" of the offside rule. However, the goal remains generally the same, to score by kicking a ball into the other player's goal. The player can control one team member at a time, "charging" and "hyper-curving" the ball.

Plot.
The game features a satirical story mode about a "kickman" who must solve the mystery of his father's death, while rising up the ranks and dealing with players of the opposing team.

Development.
The game began as a <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> joke on the feed of the game's developer, Dan Marshall, saying that he wanted to create a soccer game without knowing anything about the sport. After making a prototype as a "personal Game Jam", due to being "bogged down" by his current project at the time, he received surprisingly enthusiastic feedback. He decided to develop said game, which took over a year to develop.

Marshall stated that he himself dislikes football and created the game's story mode to "share" his "disdain". He said that while there was a large amount of positive reaction to the game, he also faced "genuine anger" from fans who "didn't realize it was a big joke".

The game's music was composed by Tobey Evans, who incorporated "faux <a href="dubstep">dubstep</a>" and <a href="chiptune">chiptune</a> elements.

Reception.
The game received mixed reception from critics, with reception to it being highly divided.

Daniel Cooper of <a href="Engadget">Engadget</a> called the game "truly original" and, while calling the gameplay its "weakest element", said that it was "enormously satisfying" when it worked, saying that its price was so low that "you can't not buy it". John Bridgman of <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> said that the game fulfilled its goals of being both funny and engaging.

Jon Denton of <a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a> rated the game 26/100, calling the gameplay "sluggish chaos" and saying that most goals come from the "extreme ineptitude of the goldkeepers" rather than "anything resembling efficient play". He called the game's humor "smug" and "run through the filter of a mild superiority complex", noting that it was not "insightful or funny". Graham Smith of <a href="Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Shotgun">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> criticized the AI as being poorly balanced and the gameplay "sloppy" and "erratic". He also stated that he found the game's humor "off-putting" and "mean-spirited", saying that it targeted "the sport's fans" and would only appeal to those who felt "assaulted" by football.

The tragic death of Miss Beena Baby, a Registered Nurse, who committed suicide due staff bullying in a private hospital which had illegal management norms was cited as the reason for the formation of this association. The so-called "bond system" executed by the <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> based hospital was an indirect violation against <a href="Bonded%20Labor%20System%20%28Abolition%29%20Act%2C%201976">Bonded Labor System (Abolition) Act, 1976</a>.

Miss Baby's death triggered a public outcry resulting in a strike by 250 nurses.

John Preston is a <a href="Concore%20Entertainment">Concore Entertainment</a> recording artist and full-time firefighter. John was a Marine Corps veteran and began his music career while in Iraq writing his song "Good Good America" the song gave John his first shot at the music industry signing a record deal upon his return from Iraq.

Life and career.
John returned to the music industry in 2014 signing with Pacific Records and quickly releasing his first single "this IS war" in October 2014. The song also became a national media topic when the Marine veteran made a call to action to veterans across the nation to stand against ISIS which had just made a surge through Syria and Iraq. Just one month later, John released his Los Angeles Music Awards nominated EP "Your War is Over". This time the topic was very different. John highlighted veterans' struggles with Post Traumatic Stress and suicide and took the fight public with several TV and radio appearances across the United States. John took to the studio again and in September 2015 released in the Top 100 New Alternative Albums chart with his second EP "Day to Night." With this EP, John told the story of a Marine that was killed on his last day of combat. John took to the media continuing with his fight against PTSD, veteran suicide, and also reminding the people of America that the country is still at war.

John's life took a turn of tragic irony when in January 2016 John's own brother fell victim to post traumatic stress and took his own life. The passing of his brother was enough to make him consider ending his career, but has instead fueled his hard work ethic that secured a national campaign against suicide. John executive produced the album "Battlecry: Songs of America's Heroes which reached number 21 on the iTunes rock charts.

Kōyō Aoyagi

is a Japanese professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> pitcher who currently plays for the <a href="Hanshin%20Tigers">Hanshin Tigers</a> of <a href="Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball">Nippon Professional Baseball</a>.

Early baseball career.
Kōyō played ball for the Terao Dolphins in his 5th grade, and went on to pitch for Namamugi Junior High. He became the ace pitcher of Kawasaki Kikoka High School in Kanagawa, but his team never made it to the <a href="Japanese%20High%20School%20Baseball%20Championship">national tournaments</a>.

He entered <a href="Teikyo%20University">Teikyo University</a> where was a regular starter at the Tokyo Metropolitan Area University Baseball League. Despite having undewent right elbow surgery in his 3rd year, he pitched spectacularly the following year where he lead the league in wins (6), and was awarded Best Nine. After four years and 37 game appearances, he finished 15-9 with a 1.91 ERA. 

Hanshin Tigers.
He was the Tiger's 5th round pick during the 2015 professional draft. He signed a 40 million yen contract with Hanshin, for an estimated annual salary of 7.2 million yen. He was assigned jersey number 50. 

2016

While he joined the main squad during spring camp and got a shot at pitching during the pre-season game against the Marines, he struggled with control as he walked the first 3 batters he faced, and ended up giving up 2 runs in 2 innings of relief.

He debuted as a starter in the June 1st away game against the Eagles, as a last minute replacement for the scheduled starter Yuya Yokoyama who suddenly experienced shoulder pain at the time. Despite walking 4 and hitting 1 batter, he completed 5 innings and only allowed a sole run, thus grabbing the win. He became the first right-handed Hanshin pitcher to win his first official start since Minoru Murayama on 1959, and the third rookie pitcher in NPB history to win his first start during Inter-league play.

His next start was on July 7 in Tokyo Dome, where he shut down the Giants by pitching 7 perfect innings while allowing only a single hit. After this, he became a regular in the Tiger's pitching rotation. But despite a strong start, he lost momentum during mid-season, and he finished the season with only 4 wins out of 13 games with a 3.29 ERA. While his win-loss percentage might be unimpressive, he only surrendered a single home run out of 289 at bats.

During the post-season break, he was selected to join the national team to pitch in the Asia Winter League tournament in Taiwan. He notched 2 wins and 1 save in 4 games (1.69 ERA), and was awarded the league's best pitcher, also won by fellow Hanshin pitcher <a href="Yuta%20Iwasada">Yuta Iwasada</a> in the previous year.

Pitching Style.
A sidewinder and sometimes submarine pitcher, Aoyagi throws a <a href="shuuto">shuuto</a> in the 130-145kph range as his main pitch, alternating with a four-seam in the high 130s (maxed at 147 kph) or a slider, with the occasional changeup.. He was clocked at 6.8 seconds at the 50 meter dash.

Personal Trivia.
Aoyagi started throwing from a three-quarters delivery when he started pitching in grade school. At first, the team manager tried to fix his mechanics, but eventually decided to encourage him to keep throwing from the side.

Aoyagi is also an avid manga fan. When he first joined the Tigers, he moved into their dormitory with about 300 volumes of the <a href="Weekly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Magazine">Weekly Shōnen Magazine</a>. When he played in the 2016 Winter League, he kept posting sad tweets of not being able to read the magazine in Taiwan. <a href="Kodansha">Kodansha</a>, the manga's publisher, read about Aoyagi's tweets, and promised him that they will reserve copies of the magazine that he wasn't able to read while overseas. The company sent 3 weeks worth of the magazine to the Tiger's camp when Aoyagi returned to Japan. Kodansha is thinking about naming him their manga publicity ambassador.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa Major Dr. Müller commanded a panzergrenadier battalion in the 3rd Panzer Division. After two weeks of hard fighting the division was able to reach the Dnieper at Rogatschew. The first attempt to cross the river on 3 July failed, as did a second attempt the next day. However further to the north Major Dr. Müller’s II./Schützen-Regiment 394, supported by 2 companies of AT guns and some amphibious tanks, were able to form a small bridgehead at Sborowo. For two days Müller and his men held the bridgehead against ferocious attacks, all while being isolated from the rest of the division due to heavy artillery fire. Only on 6 July were they reinforced by another battalion of Schützen-Regiment 394. Eventually the bridgehead was abandoned as an untenable position, but Müller’s tenacious defense of the position was nonetheless recognized by his inclusion in the Army Honour Roll and the Knight’s Cross.

Life.
Lenck was a successful entrepreneur and managed chemical and soap works in <a href="Sopron">Sopron</a>. There was a great <a href="phylloxera">phylloxera</a> epidemy in <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> in the 1890s which destroyed most of the grapefields in the country. So people could not produce wine which was particularly bad for that region, because Sopron was even then famous for its wine. Lenck looked for other options and started a dialogue with beer producers from <a href="Brno">Brno</a>, <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>. They wanted to import <a href="Beer%20in%20the%20Czech%20Republic">Czech beer</a> into <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> because they also recognised the growing demand for beer.

Lenck wanted to produce beer in Sopron so he offered his chemical plant for the beer manufacture and established a common company with the <a href="Czech%20people">Czech</a> beer producers. As a result of that in 1895 the "Első Soproni Serfőzde és Malátagyár Rt." ("First Brewery and Maltmanufacture Co.") was founded. The owners were mainly Lenck and the Czech investors, but ordinary citizens of <a href="Sopron">Sopron</a> could also buy shares in the company above 400 000 Forints.

The first beer they produced got the name "Arany Ászok" which exists today also. The initiative was despite the nearly <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n market at the beginning really successful. They made traditional beers, like "Export Márciusi", "Polgári" and "Udvari", and brown beers with the name "Milleniumi".

At the end of the century the production reached 20 000 hectolitres.

In 1899 the company opened its own beer garten which had live music and social activities which made it very popular among the citizens of Sopron.

Personal life.
He was a member of the <a href="Evangelical-Lutheran%20Church%20in%20Hungary">Evangelical-Lutheran Church</a>. He had one daughter, Elsa and two sons, Oskar and Richard.

Wondecla, Queensland

Wondecla is a <a href="Suburbs%20and%20localities%20%28Australia%29">locality</a> in the <a href="Tablelands%20Region">Tablelands Region</a>, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, Australia.

Geography.
The <a href="Kennedy%20Highway">Kennedy Highway</a> roughly forms the south-east boundary of the locality. Longlands Gap Road passes through the locality from north-west (coming from <a href="Herberton%2C%20Queensland">Herberton</a>) to the south-east, joining the Kennedy Highway at the south-east boundary.

The western part of the locality is around 900–950 metres above sea level and is flat enough to be used as farmland. The northern, eastern and southern parts of the locality are more mountainous with numerous unnamed peaks (between 1000 and 1100 metres) and are not developed. The north-east of the locality is protected as the <a href="Herberton%20Range%20National%20Park">Herberton Range National Park</a> and the <a href="Herberton%20Range%20Conservation%20Park">Herberton Range Conservation Park</a>. The southern part of the locality is The Bluff State Forest.

Wondecla Creek rises in the south-east of the locality and flows through the lower parts of the locality towards the north-east where it has its confluence with the <a href="Wild%20River%20%28Queensland%29">Wild River</a>, which then becomes the locality's western boundary.

History.
Wondecla was originally called Nigger Creek. It takes its current name from the former <a href="Wondecla%20railway%20station">Wondecla railway station</a> on the <a href="Tablelands%20railway%20line">Tablelands railway line</a>. The station's name was assigned by the <a href="Queensland%20Railways%20Department">Queensland Railways Department</a> on 31 July 1911. Wondecla is believed to be an <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20languages">Aboriginal word</a> meaning the junction of creeks, which probably refers to the confluence of the Wild River and the Wondecla Creek given that the station was near the confluence.

The Nigger Creek Provisional School opened 7 May 1883. On 1 January 1909 it became Nigger Creek State School. In 1922 it was renamed Wondecla State School. It closed on 20 July 1958.

Umade Bhattiyani

Umade Bhattiyani (d. 1562; other names "Umadeo, Uma Devi") was the second wife of <a href="Maldeo%20Rathore">Maldeo Rathore</a>, the renowned <a href="Rathore">Rathore</a> ruler of <a href="Marwar">Marwar</a> (r. 1532 – 1562). She earned the epithet of Roothi Rani — the Irate or Aggrieved Queen, or 'the Queen-who-Sulked' due to her strained relationship with her husband.

Family.
Umade was a princess of the <a href="Bhati">Bhati</a> <a href="Rajput">Rajput</a> clan of <a href="Jaisalmer">Jaisalmer</a> and was the daughter of Rawal Lunkaran Bhati, the ruler of Jaisalmer (r. 1530 - 1551). 

Marriage.
Maldeo Rathore was expanding his territories westward and plundered Jaisalmer in 1537. Rawal Lunkaran was forced to sue for peace by giving Maldeo his daughter Umade in marriage to him. The marriage was not a happy one. Lunkaran had given some "davris" (maidservants) to his daughter in her dowry. One of them was called Bharmali who was apparently very beautiful. Maldeo was greatly attracted by her beauty and on the first night of his marriage he delayed visiting Umade because he stayed too long with her maid, Bharmali. 

Umade felt insulted and decided not to speak to her husband throughout her life. She also refused to have any conjugal relations with him. Her attitude towards Maldeo earned her the title "Roothi Rani" (displeased or unhappy queen). Umade decided to leave her husband's main palace in Jodhpur and after living in <a href="Ajmer">Ajmer</a> for a while, relocated to her step-son's residence in <a href="Mewar">Mewar</a>, a mere year after her marriage in 1537. Umade never returned to Jodhpur during Maldeo's lifetime.

Death.
When Umade came to know of Maldeo's death in 1562, she <a href="Sati%20%28practice%29">immolated</a> herself at Kelva in Mewar. She did so because while Maldeo had been alive she had the status of Rani of Marwar. After her husband's death, her status changed. She also felt that Maldeo's successor, <a href="Chandrasen%20Rathore">Chandrasen Rathore</a>, who was the son of another wife of Maldeo, would not accord her the respect due to her, as she had supported the cause of another son of Maldeo instead of Chandrasen. Neither did Umade expect to receive good treatment at the hands of the other wives who had played an important role in creating further differences between her husband Maldeo and her. So, instead of facing possible humiliation, she chose to immolate herself.

List of current boxing rankings

This list of current professional boxing rankings includes the latest rankings by each one of the sport's four major sanctioning bodies, as well as other well-regarded sites and entities.

Overview.
As professional boxing has four major sanctioning bodies (<a href="World%20Boxing%20Association">WBA</a>, <a href="World%20Boxing%20Council">WBC</a>, <a href="International%20Boxing%20Federation">IBF</a>, <a href="World%20Boxing%20Organization">WBO</a>) each with their own champions, the sport doesn't have a centralized ranking system. The rankings published by these organizations share the trait of not ranking the other organizations' champions, as each one of the sanctioning bodies expects their champion to frequently defend their title against their top-ranked contender. The WBA often has more than one champion, none of which are ranked by the other 3 sanctioning bodies. Their "Super" and "Regular" champions are excluded from the rankings but their "Interim" champion is affixed to the #1 spot. The IBF's protocol is for the top 2 spots in its rankings to remain vacant until two of its other top-ranked contenders face off, at which point the winner takes one of those two places.

In addition to the rankings published by the major sanctioning bodies, the <a href="Transnational%20Boxing%20Rankings%20Board">TBRB</a> and <a href="The%20Ring%20Magazine">"The Ring"</a> each publish their own independent rankings, not excluding any organizations' champions. The aim of both the TBRB and "The Ring" is to crown a single champion for each division. Every single one of these lists are assembled by a committee but since the 90s, other parties have experimented with computerized rankings, but these are sometimes regarded as incapable of accounting for all of boxing's quirks and subtleties. The most widely known computerized rankings are published by <a href="BoxRec">BoxRec</a> and updated daily. The following is a list compiling the latest installment of all the previously mentioned rankings.

Roby supported herself working as a bookkeper while attending college.

Her clerk was <a href="Viola%20Griswold">Viola Griswold</a>, who won the medal for scholarship over 85 men when graduated in 1892 at the Northwestern University.

Personal life.
Ida Hall Roby moved to Chicago in 1881. She was married to Alfred H. Roby, a salesman, but they were separated and she was supporting alone their son.

In 1895 Roby employed George H. Roby as a clerk in her store, and in 1899 her name disappeared from the directory, while George was listed as the druggist.

Roby died of pneumonia on March 2, 1899. She is buried at Mountain Home Cemetery, Kalamazoo County (Plot: Lot H Sec 310 Grave 9).

Kibori kuma

Kibori kuma () is a Japanese <a href="rural%20craft">rural craft</a> that consists of a wooden carving of a bear with a fish in its mouth. The sculptures are mainly produced in <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>; small carvings are sold as souvenirs of the island. The most common design depicts a <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a> biting a <a href="chum%20salmon">chum salmon</a>, and the sculptor portrays the bear’s thick bristles by using an axe. However, many variations of the "kibori kuma" have evolved.

Origins.
, the 19th leader of the <a href="Owari%20branch">Owari branch</a>, purchased a wooden carving of a bear while he was in <a href="Bern">Bern</a>, Switzerland; Tokugawa was traveling through Europe between 1921 and 1922.

After returning to Japan, Tokugawa traveled to the “Tokugawa Farm,” a farm in the town of <a href="Yakumo%2C%20Hokkaido">Yakumo</a> that was then part of the <a href="Owari%20Domain">Owari Domain</a>. Tokugawa presented the carving to the farmers, suggesting that they manufacture copies of it during the winter as a source of income. The farmers agreed, and the first sculptures they made were displayed at a 1924 exhibition of rural arts and crafts that was held in the town.

During a 1927 exhibition, a kibori kuma was awarded a prize and offered to <a href="Yasuhito%2C%20Prince%20Chichibu">Prince Chichibu</a>. The following year, an exhibition of bear sculptures was held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Yakumo. Through these exhibitions, the popularity of kibori kuma spread throughout the country; as many as 5,000 carvings were produced during the early <a href="Sh%C5%8Dwa%20period">Shōwa period</a>.

The kibori kuma was also produced in the city of <a href="Asahikawa%2C%20Hokkaido">Asahikawa</a>. Matsui Umetarou, an <a href="Ainu%20people">Ainu</a>, helped manufacture the souvenir and increase its popularity. In fact, when <a href="Emperor%20Hirohito">Emperor Hirohito</a> visited Hokkaido in 1936, he was offered two bear carvings—one from Yakumo and one from Asahikawa.

However, manufacture of the souvenir has since declined; as of 2012, only one site of production remains. A museum in Yakumo town opened in April 2012 to display these crafts to the community once again.

In the first part of the battle the Russians had made major advances, cutting off the German Infanterie-Regiment 429 in the city of Ternowaja. The first German relief force, containing elements of the 23rd Panzer Division, succeeded in linking up with the defenders but was itself cut off following Russian counterattacks. It was not until 20 May that the Germans were able to try a second time. Schmidt-Ott’s kampfgruppe spearheaded the attack, capturing Hill 219.7 that was just outside Ternowaja. Despite being driven back that night, the kampfgruppe renewed the assault the next morning and established contact with the encircled units at 1005 hours.

"Cebus capucinus imitator" differs from "C. c. capucinus" in that females have elongated frontal tufts.

History.

An article of the constitution enjoins upon us not to pay one farthing to any slaveholder for the property they may claim in a human being...Our mission is to succor those who claim property in themselves, and thereby acknowledge an independence of slavery.

At least two of its members, John Coburn and James Scott, took part in the rescue of <a href="Shadrach%20Minkins">Shadrach Minkins</a> in 1850.

The Association eventually merged with the interracial Boston Vigilance Committee.

Joseph Mathia Svoboda

Joseph Mathia Svoboda (October 17, 1840 - January 19, 1908) was a Lynch Company employee who kept extensive diaries during the course of his life. He started working for the company as an officer on board the company's steamers in 1862, in which he would make regular trips up and down the Tigris river to carry cargo and passengers to different ports below Baghdad and Basra. It was during this time that he started writing the diaries that he kept until his death in 1908. In these diaries, he documented all the trips he made on the Lynch steamers, writing down names of official passengers and others with details of cargo and noteworthy events of every trip. In addition, he recorded many details of his life and the lives of his family and friends in Baghdad. The more than 40 years of diaries remain a precious resource for life and trade in Ottoman Iraq and Victorian Baghdad during the last half of the 19th century.

</div>

Post Mortem and Joseph's Diaries.
Years later, in 1929, a disgruntled and divorced Alexander Richard Svoboda left Baghdad for Istanbul, leaving his father’s remaining diaries, which he had inherited, with an unnamed Catholic priest. The priest later turned them over to Yaqub Sarkis (1876–1958) an important amateur historian from Baghdad, who wrote extensively on the history of Iraq and amassed a large and rich library. The diaries remained in Sarkis’ private library, which was later moved to the Jesuit university (Dar ul-Hikma), later Baghdad University, until the Jesuits were expelled by the Saddam Hussein regime and the university was nationalized.

In the early 1970s, another scholar at al-Hikma University, Mrs. Margaret Makiya, received a small grant from the Gulbenkian Foundation to transcribe the Svoboda diaries. During this period and later, she transcribed 31 of the diaries held in the Sarkis library and planned to transcribe them all eventually. In 1985, Professor Henry Svoboda, head of the Architectural Consultancies of Iraq and a descendant of Anton Svoboda, conceived a project to use a few poor photocopies of the diaries and the Makiya transcriptions for writing a family history of 19thcentury Iraq. In this project he solicited the assistance of one of his staff, the architect Nowf Allawi, who was fluent in French, English, and Arabic. The work proceeded slowly for twenty years and came nearly to an end with the sudden illness and tragic death of Professor Svoboda in 2005. Subsequently, Ms. Allawi decided to keep the project going in honor of her mentor and friend. However, the events of 9/11/2001 and the following invasion of Iraq by U. S. forces made research in Baghdad impossible, at which point, in 2006, Ms. Allawi, who was seeking the assistance of an academic community, made contact with Prof. Walter G. Andrews and the Ottoman Texts Archive Project—an event that was the beginning of the <a href="Svoboda%20Diaries">Svoboda Diaries Project</a> and later of the collaborative publishing project: NEWBOOK Digital Texts in the Humanities

<doc id="54819096" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54819096" title="Mikagura-uta">
Mikagura-uta

The Mikagura-uta, (みかぐらうた, "The Songs for the Service") is one of the three <a href="Tenrikyo">Tenrikyo</a> scriptures, along with the "<a href="Ofudesaki">Ofudesaki</a>" and the "<a href="Osashizu">Osashizu</a>". It was composed by foundress of Tenrikyo, <a href="Miki%20Nakayama">Miki Nakayama</a>, from 1866 to 1875, and revised to its current version in 1882.
Etymology and meaning.
"Mikagura-uta" can be subdivided into three sections. "Mi" is an <a href="Honorific%20speech%20in%20Japanese%23Honorific%20prefixes">honorific prefix</a>. The word "kagura" is a generic term for any performance for a deity or deities in Japan. Although "kagura" are usually associated with <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> shrines, there is also historical evidence of their association with <a href="Shugendo">Shugendo</a> and <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> schools such as <a href="Shingon">Shingon</a>.
The word "uta" simply means "song" or "songs."

It is unknown when “Mikagura-uta” became the standardized title. During the years from 1867 and 1887, a variety of titles were used, with the most common being “"Juni-kudari o-tsutome (no) uta"” (the Twelve Songs of the Service). The earliest evidence of the current title dates to October 1888, when the songs was first formally published by Tenrikyo as “御かぐら歌.” However, since the "<a href="kanji">kanji</a>" character 御 could potentially be read either as ""O"" and ""On"" in addition to ""Mi"," it still cannot be said with absolute certainty when “Mikagura-uta” became the standard title (in the past it was referred to sometimes as ""Okagura-uta"").

The first time the title of the Mikagura-uta took its current written form (only in "<a href="hiragana">hiragana</a>") was in 1928, when the scripture was distributed to all churches to commemorate Shozen Nakayama’s marriage.

Significance.
The Mikagura-uta is the text of the Service ("otsutome"), a religious <a href="ritual">ritual</a> that has a central place in Tenrikyo. During the Service, the text to the Mikagura-uta is sung together with dance movements and musical accompaniment. <a href="Miki%20Nakayama">Miki Nakayama</a> composed all of the aspects of the Service – the text, the dance ("otefuri"), and music ("narimono") – and taught them to her followers.

History and composition.
Songs for the Kagura Service.
According to Tenrikyo followers, the Kagura Service "reenacts God's creation of humankind" around the spot humankind was conceived (called the "Jiba"), located at <a href="Tenrikyo%20Church%20Headquarters">Tenrikyo Church Headquarters</a> in <a href="Tenri%2C%20Nara">Tenri, Nara</a>. Therefore, the Kagura Service can only be performed in one place. However, the songs are also sung during the Seated Service, which substitutes for the Kagura Service at all other church ceremonies, and which also can be performed individually or in a group.

Section One.
In the autumn of 1866, Nakayama taught section one, which was originally worded, 
In 1882, Nakayama altered the wording to the text used today: 

Section Two.
Four years later, in 1870, Nakayama taught section two, which begins with the line,

Section Three.
Then in 1875, Nakayama taught section three, which was originally worded,
In 1882, she altered the wording to the text used today: 

Songs for the Dance with Hand Movements.
Section Four.
In 1870, Nakayama taught section four, the "Eight Verses of the Yorozuyo" (よろづよ八首), in 1870. This was the last section to be composed.

Section Five.
This section, known as the "Twelve Songs," was composed between January and August 1867. From 1867 to 1870, Nakayama taught her adherents the melodies and movements to accompany her texts.

Xoán Paredes

Xoán M. Paredes (; born in 1975) is a <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galician</a> <a href="geographer">geographer</a>, teacher and ordained <a href="Celtic%20Reconstructionist%20Paganism">druid</a>.

Paredes is a <a href="Licentiate%20%28degree%29%23Spain">"licenciado"</a> in Geography by the <a href="University%20of%20Santiago%20de%20Compostela">University of Santiago de Compostela</a> (Galicia), where he studied under the direction of <a href="Carlos%20Ferr%C3%A1s%20Sexto">Carlos Ferrás</a>. He completed his <a href="MPhil">MPhil</a> thesis at <a href="University%20College%20Cork">University College Cork</a> (Ireland), under the supervision of <a href="Patrick%20O%27Flanagan">Patrick O'Flanagan</a>.

During his stay in Ireland (1999-2010), Paredes worked as a teaching and library assistant at UCC, and collaborated regularly with the <a href="https%3A//www.ucc.ie/en/galician/">Irish Centre for Galician Studies</a> and the <a href="Department%20of%20Education%20and%20Skills%20%28Ireland%29">Department of Education</a>.

He currently teaches social sciences, <a href="English%20language">English</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, while he remains involved in a number of <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> organisations and projects. He is a former member of the <a href="Galician%20Institute%20for%20Celtic%20Studies">Galician Institute for Celtic Studies</a>. Paredes has been responsible for the organisation of academic seminars and conferences and he is a regular name in the discussions about <a href="Celtic%20nations%23Iberian%20Peninsula">Celtic Galicia</a>.
Research.
Paredes has conducted research in the fields of <a href="spatial%20planning">spatial planning</a> and <a href="cultural%20geography">cultural geography</a>, with a focus on <a href="language%20geography">geolinguistics</a>, <a href="Atlantic%20Europe">Atlantic Europe</a> and cultural landscapes. He has helped in defining the concept of <a href="cultural%20landscape">cultural landscape</a> as:
""... the environment modified by the human being in the course of time, the long-term combination between anthropic action on this environment and the physical constraints limiting or conditioning human activity. It is a geographical area – including natural and cultural resources – associated to historical evolution, which gives way to a recognizable landscape for a particular human group, up to the point of being identifiable as such by others.""

Like a number of other previous authors such as <a href="Otero%20Pedrayo">Otero Pedrayo</a>, Paredes links his native Galicia to a genuinely Atlantic culture despite being part of a Mediterranean <a href="sovereign%20state">state</a> (Spain). In doing so, he identifies a cultural landscape common to Atlantic (namely Celtic) Europe mainly based on the settlement pattern, use and shared perception of the <a href="Sociology%20of%20space%23Third%20Space">lived space</a>.

Following on <a href="John%20T.%20Koch">John T. Koch's</a> and <a href="Barry%20Cunliffe">Barry Cunliffe’s</a> “Celtic from the West” postulates, Paredes supports the <a href="Paleolithic%20Continuity%20Theory">Paleolithic Continuity Paradigm</a>, thus coinciding with <a href="Francesco%20Benozzo">Francesco Benozzo</a> when locating the origins of <a href="Celts">Celtic Culture</a> in north-west <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberia</a>. Once again, Paredes considers that there is a particular Celtic cultural landscape (although presenting variations in scale) which demonstrates in itself a social and cultural unity and continuity.

Regarding planning and territorial management, Paredes defends a deep restructuring of the Galician official administrative jurisdictions. He considers them to be the result of forced foreign (Spanish) intervention and therefore in disarray with the traditional – and still operating at a popular and psychological level – Galician territorial tiers. His research also criticises the governmental improvisation and lack of strategic planning in Galician territorial implementations.

Paredes has also conducted comparative studies between Galicia-North Portugal and Ireland in all of the above-mentioned topics.



Personal life.
Raised between Galicia and <a href="Majorca">Majorca</a>, Paredes lived in <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a> (Ireland) from 1999 to 2010. He now resides in Pontevedra (Galicia).

He is fluent in English, <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Galician%20language">Galician</a> and Portuguese, where he takes the <a href="reintegrationism">reintegrationist</a> position with regards to the relationship between modern Galician and Portuguese.

He is a user and avid supporter of <a href="free%20software">free software</a> and <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, as well as a vocal fan of <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal music</a> and <a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>.

Religious beliefs.
Paredes is the current head of the "<a href="http%3A//www.durvate.org">Irmandade Druídica Galaica</a>" (Pan-Galician Druidic Fellowship), an officially registered religious organisation. He is, therefore, a believer in <a href="Celtic%20Reconstructionist%20Paganism">reconstructionist Druidry</a>, although following an orthodox approach unlike most contemporary neo-druidic groups.

Political views.
In his works, mostly in his essays and publications on social media, Paredes is an advocate for <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a> and often associates himself with <a href="left-wing%20politics">left-wing</a> positions. Likewise, he is a strong supporter of full <a href="Galician%20nationalism">Galician independence</a> from Spain.

It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2000. At the time of its nomination it consisted of seven resources, which included five <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20property%20types%23Building">contributing buildings</a>, one <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20property%20types%23Structure">contributing structure</a>, and one non-contributing structure. The historic buildings include a two-story, wood frame, side <a href="gable">gable</a> house (1887); a gabled <a href="basement%20barn">basement barn</a> (c. 1887); a gabled barn (1893); <a href="chicken%20house">chicken house</a> (1880s, with additions from the 1940s or 1950s), and a single-stall garage (1910s-1930s). The <a href="corncrib">corncrib</a> (1910s or 1920s) is the historic structure. A three-stall garage (1972) is the non-contributing structure. The farmstead is located on a hilltop and sideslope. The house sits on the highest elevation, with the outbuildings located down the slope to the west and southwest.

The first known owners of the farm were Isaac and Nancy Cox who farmed this property from at least 1859. Jan Janko settled here in 1864 and bought the property from the Cox's in 1875. From then until at least 2000 the farm has been owned by a <a href="Bohemian">Bohemian</a> immigrant or a person of Bohemian descent. While the farm no longer reflects the initial settlement of <a href="Linn%20County%2C%20Iowa">Linn County</a>, it does reflect the early settlement of Bohemian immigrants in the county. It is also significant that the original dwelling, probably a log cabin or log house, is no longer extant. Janko replaced the older house instead of adding onto it, which was more typical of the area's Bohemian immigrants.

"Giants" was serviced to American <a href="hot%20adult%20contemporary">hot adult contemporary</a> radio on July 24, 2017.

Content.
The title and <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hook</a> for the song were inspired by a phrase featured on British currency: "And we will ride on the shoulders of giants." The <a href="chorus%20%28song%29">chorus</a> and verses for the song were developed separately and are set to different tempos; according to Lights, this created a "challenging structure" to deal with, but the writers were determined to mesh the two parts.

Chart performance.
"Giants" debuted at number 41 on the <a href="Canada%20Hot%20AC">Canada Hot AC</a> chart dated August 12, 2017 and has since reached a peak of 36. "Giants" also debuted at number 39 on the <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a> <a href="Adult%20Pop%20Songs">Adult Pop Songs</a> chart dated August 19, 2017. This made it Lights' first song to chart in the United States.

Music video.
The accompanying music video for "Giants" was directed by Jeremy Schaulin-Rioux and premiered June 23, 2017. It takes place in the dystopian world created for the "Skin & Earth" comic series connected with the album, and introduces characters and events that takes place in the series' fifth issue. In the video, Lights plays En, the protagonist from her "Skin & Earth" comics, as she meets a mysterious being and is transported to another dimension.

In the absence of strong party affiliations outside the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labour Party</a> (which was divided on the question), candidates tended to be defined in relation to their attitude to trade, and while Barton sought compromise, the Free Trader George Reid pushed for the question to be a central election issue.

Following the March election, Barton's Protectionists won 27 seats in the newly formed 75 member <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">Australian House of Representatives</a>. Reid's Free Trade supporters won 32 seats, leaving the Labour Party, on 16 seats, with the balance of power. Labour confirmed "support in return for concessions" and backed Barton, who became Prime Minister in a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a>. The 36 seat Senate meanwhile held just 14 Senators declaring themselves in support of the Barton Government. The <a href="Deakin%20Government%20%281903-1904%29">Deakin Government (1903-1904)</a> and <a href="Watson%20Government">Watson Government</a> followed the <a href="Barton%20Government">Barton Government</a>.

The <a href="Watson%20Government">Watson Government</a> governed from 27 April 1904 to 18 August 1904 and was the first Labor Party national government in both Australia and in the world. 
<a href="Chris%20Watson">Chris Watson</a> commanded a majority in neither the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, nor the <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a>. Amid the volatile environment of early Federation Australian politics, the Watson Government passed just six bills. Other than an amended Acts Interpretation Act 1904, these were all money bills, however, Watson advanced the landmark Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, passed later in 1904 by the Reid Government.

In Office.
Reid's government continued the early work of establishing the legislative frameworks of the newly formed Australian Federation. George Reid led the <a href="Free%20Trade%20Party">Free Trade Party</a> and was sworn in as Prime Minister on 18 August 1904, replacing the <a href="Watson%20Government">Watson Government</a>. Reid governed in shaky coalition with the <a href="Protectionist%20Party">Protectionists</a>, and his government lasted until July 1905. It was responsible for the passage of the "<a href="Conciliation%20and%20Arbitration%20Act%201904">Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904</a>".

Reid denounced the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labour Party</a> as the "Socialist tiger". Watson encouraged <a href="Alfred%20Deakin">Alfred Deakin</a> to abandon the Free Traders, saying: "We, and especially me, don't want office, but I have the utmost anxiety to stop the retrogressive movement which Reid is heading." Deakin commenced his second term as Prime Minister in July 1905, with Labour's support 

Reid adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201906">1906 election</a>, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionists in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the <a href="Westminster%20system">Westminster tradition</a> and regarded a <a href="two-party%20system">two-party system</a> as very much the norm.

Aftermath.
The Reid Government was succeeded by the <a href="Deakin%20Government%20%281905-1908%29">Deakin Government (1905-1908)</a>.

Ben Wilson is an Australian <a href="kitesurfer">kitesurfer</a> notable for holding the record for kitesurfing the largest wave ever captured on film; In 2011, Ben successfully kited Fiji’s most infamous wave, Cloudbreak at 35-foot. There have been many attempts by the next generation of kitesurfers including Nicolo Porcella and Jesse Richman to best this feat but as yet there has been no successful attempt. 

Prior to his wave at Cloudbreak, Ben was part of the early kitesurfing movement in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, winning Australia’s inaugural National Titles along with multiple competitions including the Merimbula Classic and Schick Kitesurfing Series. During the same period (2003-2005), he placed 3rd in the <a href="Gorge%20Games">Gorge Games</a> held in <a href="Hood%20River%2C%20Oregon">Hood River, Oregon</a>. Off the back of these outstanding competitive results he was signed to Slingshot and shortly after turned his focus from competition to creating video content. 

Ben spent over 10 years as a team rider for Slingshot, during which time he traveled the world and created feature-length documentaries such as The Dirty South and . He was featured in Surfers Journal in their article The Might of the Kite and continued to push kitesurfing towards a mainstream surf market through his Jeep Kite School initiative and coaching trips. 

Wilson’s first experience kitesurfing came in 2000 while working on <a href="Namotu">Namotu</a> Island, in Fiji.

From there the wave riding movement gained traction and in 2009 Wilson launched his own surf-focused kite brand, BenWilsonSurf (now BWSURF).

The historic buildings include two small side <a href="gable">gable</a>d houses (c. 1860s-1880s); a two-story, frame, <a href="American%20Foursquare">American Foursquare</a> house (1910s or 1920s); a gabled barn that was moved here from another farm (1890s-early 1900s); and a feeder barn (c. 1912). One of two <a href="corncrib">corncrib</a>s (1933), a hog house (early 1900s), and a <a href="chicken%20house">chicken house</a> (early 1900s) are the historic structures. Another corncrib and a couple of metal sheds from the mid to late 20th century are the non-contributing structures.

While the farm dates from at least 1869, it reflects the early settlement of <a href="Bohemian">Bohemian</a> immigrants in the county beginning with Joseph and Ann Podhajsky in 1877. John Podhajsky was listed as the owner in 1895, but this could be a mistake as there is no John in the family and Joseph was still alive. Frank Hyuck owned the farm from c. 1902 to 1907. Albert and Josephine Jansa bought the farm in 1907, and it remained in their family into the 1990s. The two small side gabled houses are indicative of a Bohemian immigrant farm. The older of the two was built here in the 1860s or 1870s, and is a step up from a log cabin. It was a gabled cottage with sleeping loft above. The second house was built elsewhere in the 1870s or 1880s and moved here by the Podhajskys in 1880s or 1890s and added to the original house to create a larger house. After the larger family home was built these two houses were separated and repurposed for other uses.

"WTF!" is the directorial debut by Peter Herro. It was released on VOD on August 1, 2017 by <a href="Midnight%20Releasing">Midnight Releasing</a> 

Plot.
Years after narrowly escaping a mass slaughter that left her traumatized, Rachel reluctantly attends a Spring Break retreat with her friends. Her brother in tow, her borderline abusive boyfriend flirting with her girlfriends, and stoner bro hangers-on along for the ride, the entire group decide to spend Spring Break in an isolated cabin in the woods. Hormones, secrets, and skinny-dipping abound, but there's a lingering danger around the edges of their adventure, creepy noises and strange happenings, including a nail through the foot of one of the girls. 

When one of their group goes missing, only to turn up dead with his throat slit, trouble shifts to the forefront. A hooded figure stalks the group, one that knocking each member off in particularly nasty ways,s, from a knifing to hair-spray flames to the face. With bodies mounting and tempers flaring, Rachel realizes what happened to her before is happening again. She's about to face off once again with the monster that killed her last group of friends. Unlike the last time, the only way out is to face down her tormentor -- and the twist to the murders that makes the deaths even more horrible than first revealed. 

Cast.
 as Rachel

Production.
Herro spent three months in auditions, finding actors that fit the parts and were up for the challenge.

The film was produced by Cthulhu Crush Productions, a Los Angeles-based company headed by Steve Parker and Jody Wheeler.  Parker and Wheeler produced <a href="Judas%20Kiss%20%282011%20film%29">Judas Kiss</a>, and Wheeler wrote and directed while Parker produced <a href="The%20Dark%20Place">The Dark Place</a>.

Reviews.
<a href="http%3A//thecriticalcritics.com/">The Critical Critics</a> gave the movie three out of five, saying ",,[t]ropes abound, from weird locals espousing caution, to sabotaged escape vehicles, to characters wandering off alone with the full knowledge that a murderer is on the loose. But it’s all done with a consistent tongue-in-cheek tone and good pacing across an attention-friendly running time, so it’s hard to complain. It isn’t the smartest show in town, but WTF! is sleazy fun." 

A World of <a href="https%3A//awordofdreams.com">Dreams</a> also wrote highly of the film, saying "... [e]ven if Herro’s protagonists are routinely etched, it is all part of the joyous embrace of tradition so often found in these efforts...Even though this attribute makes for a presentation that can never be measured as groundbreaking, it is certainly absorbing. When combined with the complex touches Herro puts on the construction of the chronicle and a lead that resonates genuine interest, "WTF!" endures as many cuts above average."

<a href="http%3A//withoutyourhead.com/index.php">Without Your Head</a> was far less effusive, stating "..[t]he movie doesn’t get any better than this excellent opening. From there it sinks into stereotypical slasher with oversexed teen stoners and comically bad dialogue...Unfortunately after an hour and a half of beyond dimwitted teen dialogue, you prefer all the characters die...[I]f this film finds an audience it’ll be fans who like dimwitted, frat boy humor, too silly for mainstream."

He witnessed the start of bands like the <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a> and <a href="Talking%20Heads">Talking Heads</a> and he found that he enjoyed small scale shows like that over larger shows like <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>. He spent some time in <a href="England">England</a> where he discovered UK punk bands like <a href="the%20Clash">the Clash</a> and <a href="Sham%2069">Sham 69</a>. He moved to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> to attend <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a>, with a view to becoming a lawyer, but that changed when he saw his first <a href="Black%20Flag%20%28band%29">Black Flag</a> concert there, which lead to his getting involved with hardcore, working with bands like Black Flag, <a href="Minor%20Threat">Minor Threat</a>, the <a href="Circle%20Jerks">Circle Jerks</a> and the <a href="Dead%20Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a>. he briefly managed the <a href="Noise%20rock">noise</a> band <a href="No%20Trend">No Trend</a>.

Currently Blush is a regular speaker at talk shows and events like the <a href="CMJ">CMJ</a> in New York.

Journalist.
Even though Blush had no experience as a journalist, he started writing articles for magazines such as <a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>, <a href="Details%20%28magazine%29">Details</a> and <a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>. His first assignment was an interview with local hardcore band, the <a href="Cro-mags">Cro-mags</a>.

Author.
American Hardcore.
After moving on from Seconds magazine, Blush decided to chronicle his hardcore musical journey in a book. He started writing the book, "American Hardcore", in the mid-90s when bands like <a href="Green%20Day">Green Day</a> and <a href="Offspring">Offspring</a> were popular. He saw a documentary entitled "The History of Rock and Roll' on <a href="PBS">PBS</a>, which he described as going "straight from the Sex Pistols and Clash (I believe it mentions X) to Nirvana, as if this decade had never happened. It was like the untold story of rock." Blush said that hardcore was like a "dirty little secret that nobody really talked about when it came to music." The book is Blush's first hand account of the hardcore music scene from 1980-1986 and it exposed the punk rock underground lifestyle to a more mainstream audience, revealing it as an alternative to what many considered the life of a 'rock star'.

The <a href="Punknews.org">Punknews.org</a> review said that Blush "attempted and made a really good effort to cover every scene from every area around the country." <a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a> said is "absolutely essential reading"

In 2006 a movie version of the book was produced, which included interviews with bands such as <a href="Black%20Flag%20%28band%29">Black Flag</a>, <a href="Minor%20Threat">Minor Threat</a> and <a href="Bad%20Brains">Bad Brains</a>. The <a href="Dead%20Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> and <a href="Misfits%20%28band%29">Misfits</a> declined to participate. The file was an official selection of both the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a> and the <a href="Toronto%20Film%20Festival">Toronto Film Festival</a>.

American Hair Metal.
Blush's second book, "American Hair Metal", was written partially to buck conformity. Blush discovered <a href="hair%20metal">hair metal</a> through the band <a href="Cinderella%20%28band%29">Cinderella</a>. Even though he was a "punk dude", he appreciated their "majestic bluesy groove". Other bands covered in the book include <a href="Britny%20Fox">Britny Fox</a>, <a href="Danger%20Danger">Danger Danger</a>, <a href="Roxx%20Gang">Roxx Gang</a>, <a href="Vinnie%20Vincent%20Invasion">Vinnie Vincent Invasion</a>, and <a href="Nitro%20%28band%29">Nitro</a>.

<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a> said: "In the '80s, before decorum was invented, we liked our rockers flammably coiffed. Author Steven Blush's 'American Hair Metal' remembers that era with philosophical quips from <a href="Poison%20%28band%29">Poison</a> and <a href="M%C3%B6tley%20Cr%C3%BCe">Mötley Crüe</a>."

Lost Rockers.
"Lost Rockers" profiles the lives of certain artists and musicians who almost made it to the big time but didn't. These folks knew all the right people, etc. but somehow they never crossed the line into stardom and are largely now forgotten.

In 2017 a movie was made of the book.

New York Rock.
"New York Rock" chronicles the music of the city, starting with the rise of the <a href="Velvet%20Underground">Velvet Underground</a> in 1966, to the closing of the <a href="CBGB">CBGB</a> bar in 2006, some 40 years later. Blush chose those milestones because he believed the Velvet Underground where the first rock and roll band to appeal to "adult sensibilities", and because he felt that the end of CBGB marked the end of an era.

In a review for The Big Takeover, critic James Mann said that Blush has "brought together a wealth of history charting the rise of rock and roll in the Big Apple". The Kirkus review described the book as a "brisk overview of New York City's rock 'n' roll tradition, from doo-wop to hard core, mirroring the city’s transformations. Writing for <a href="AM%20New%20York">AM New York</a>, Hal Bienstock said: "Author, promoter and DJ Steven Blush has been covering the scene for decades, and his new book is a comprehensive look at the city's rock music, highlighting both the legends and the lesser-known acts." DJ Jason said "It’s actually pretty amazing that something so special and prosperous in NYC has been overlooked by journalists for so long."

Adana campaign

The Campaign for Adana occurred after Ottoman forces seized the city of Adana from the Mamluk Sultanate. The Mamluks would respond by sending a force under Commander and Chief Uzbek. The Mamluks would besiege Adana. The Ottomans responded by sending a large relief force that was defeated.

Background.
The Ottoman Empire had launched a campaign in 1485 against the Mamluk holdings in Southern Turkey and in Cicilia Armenia, seizing areas such as Adana. The Mamluk Forces in Tartus Mountains withdrew to Aleppo. In order to respond, Sultan Qaitbey had Atabeg Uzbek launch a counter offensive. To this cause Qaitbey had granted Uzbek 3,000 Royal Mamluks as well as Nine of the 15 Emirs of 1,000. The force set off from Cairo to Damascus to Aleppo, recruiting local Syrian peasants along the way. In February the Mamluks arrived to Adana. 

First Battle of Adana.
After a peace message by Uzbek was ignored, the Mamluks confronted an Ottoman force outside the city. The Ottomans were quickly routed, with many fleeing. Around 800 were captured, including 17 commanders and paraded in Damascus, Aleppo, and Cairo. After the battle, the Mamluks besieged Adana.

Second Battle of Adana.
When Sultan Bayezid II learned of the offensive on Adana, he sent Hersek-oglu to lead an Ottoman army to relieve Adana. Hersek-oglu was the son of Stjepan Vukeic, Duke of Herzegovia, who was sent as a hostage to the court of Mehmed II. There he grew up with Bayezid. When Bayezid seized power, he allowed Kersek-oglu to marry one of his daughters, as well as granted him a high position. Hersek-oglu's army would reach the Mamluks, when it's reconnaissance unit was routed by the Mamluks. The survivors managed to report that the Mamluks had less than 15,000 soldiers. The battle occurred on March 15th. There, Hersek-oglu's forces suffered a massive defeat. The Turkmen contingents fled during the beginning of the battle. Hersek-oglu and 200 of his Janissaries fought on despite being encircled. He was wounded and captured by the Mamluks.

After the battle, the Adana garrison of 1,500 fighters surrendered. 

Results.
The Ottoman prisoners were sent to Syria. The Mamluk victory allowed the Mamluks to re-establish contro lof Tartus and Adana. Despite attempts to broker peace by the Mamluks, the Ottomans would continue to launch further offensives.

<doc id="54820406" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54820406" title="John Aisance">
John Aisance

John Aisance (<a href="Ojibwe%20language">Ojibwe</a> name Aisance) was a chief among the <a href="Chippewas%20of%20Lakes%20Huron%20and%20Simcoe">Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe</a> and leader of the Otter clan of that people from at least 1815 until his death in 1847. He participated in the <a href="Lake%20Simcoe%E2%80%93Lake%20Huron%20Purchase">Lake Simcoe–Lake Huron Purchase</a> in 1815, served the provincial government during the <a href="Upper%20Canada%20Rebellion">Upper Canada Rebellion</a>, and was the first and founding chief of the <a href="Beausoleil%20First%20Nation">Beausoleil First Nation</a>.

Early Life and Land Treaties.
Aisance's father, also called Aisance, preceded him as chief and clan leader. Their identical names have created confusion and debate among historians. The family's principal territorial interests seem to have lain in <a href="Penetanguishene">Penetanguishene</a> and the surrounding area. It was the elder Aisance, apparently, whose name is recorded among the five <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a> chiefs who authorized the surrender of the area to the provincial government in the <a href="Penetanguishene%20Bay%20Purchase">Penetanguishene Bay Purchase</a> in 1798. In 1815, the younger Aisance participated alongside two other chiefs, including <a href="William%20Yellowhead">Musquakie</a>, the future head chief, in authorizing the <a href="Lake%20Simcoe%E2%80%93Lake%20Huron%20Purchase">Lake Simcoe–Lake Huron Purchase</a>, surrendering 250,000 acres of territory extending from the Penetanguishene area to the north shore of <a href="Kempenfelt%20Bay">Kempenfelt Bay</a> (present-day North <a href="Simcoe%20County">Simcoe</a>).

Coldwater.
In 1817, Musquakie succeeded his father <a href="Yellow%20Head%20of%20Lake%20Simcoe">Yellow Head</a> as head chief of the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe. The next year, he four other chiefs authorized the <a href="Lake%20Simcoe%E2%80%93Nottawasaga%20Purchase">Lake Simcoe–Nottawasaga Purchase</a>, surrendering 1,600,000 acres of territory west of Lake Simcoe to the government. Aisance was not involved in this purchase—the Otter clan was represented instead by Muskigonce—which left the Ojibwe with virtually no territory of their own, although they reserved the right to continue to range and hunt across the land they had relinquished.

In 1828, the Ojibwe reportedly "expressed a strong desire to be admitted to Christianity, and to adopt the habits of civilized life". When they converted to <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a> later that year, Aisance, the foremost of Musquakie's subordinate chiefs, set an example by dismissing two of his three wives. Presumably it was now that he adopted the Christian name John. In 1830, the Ojibwe were induced by Lieutenant Governor <a href="John%20Colborne%2C%201st%20Baron%20Seaton">John Colborne</a> to settle permanently in two purpose-built villages, one at Atherley Narrows between Lakes Simcoe and <a href="Lake%20Couchiching">Couchiching</a>, where Musquakie settled with a part of his people, and the other at Gissinausebing, or <a href="Severn%2C%20Ontario">Coldwater</a>, where Aisance settled with the remainder of the Ojibwe. The house built for him there by the government was the only frame house in a village otherwise made up of log houses, in recognition of his chiefly status.

Although Colborne's agents considered that this settlement and "civilizing" experiment was succeeding, Aisance quickly became disillusioned with the government agents and Methodist missionaries with whom he was obliged to deal. In 1832 he even converted to <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a>, his band following suit. In 1836, <a href="Francis%20Bond%20Head">Francis Bond Head</a> replaced Colborne as Lieutenant Governor and soon brought the experiment to an end. He opened talks with Musquakie and Aisance and persuaded them to leave the Simcoe-Coldwater corridor (which had remained Crown land), enticing them with the promise of one-third of the proceeds of the anticipated sales of lots there to European settlers. In 1842, Aisance joined four other chiefs in signing Musquakie's complaint to Governor General <a href="Charles%20Bagot">Charles Bagot</a>, protesting that Bond Head had not fully explained the 1836 purchase agreement, and had, in particular, not made it clear that it did not involve an upfront, lump-sum payment, nor that the Ojibwe would receive only one-third of the sale proceeds. At their request, the proceeds of the piecemeal sales of lots in the Simcoe-Coldwater corridor were subsequently banked so that the Ojibwe could receive an annual income from the interest, which they divided three ways between Musquakie's band, Aisance's band and a third band led by <a href="Joseph%20Snake">Joseph Snake</a> settled on the islands of Lake Simcoe. The chiefs also claimed ongoing Ojibwe ownership of the grist mill at Coldwater, which finally passed from their hands in 1849.

Upper Canada Rebellion.
Towards the end of 1838, Bond Head called the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe to arms to help keep the peace in the wake of the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837-38. Aisance dutifully assembled twenty-one warriors, abandoning the autumn hunt in the process, and followed Musquakie to an encampment at <a href="Holland%20Landing%2C%20Ontario">Holland Landing</a>. The Ojibwe were soon dismissed, at which they complained "most bitterly" to government agents that the small stipend paid to them for this brief period of service was too little to offset the economic blow of having been compelled to abandon their hunting. In response to this outcry, the government approved the payment of rations to the Ojibwe until the end of February 1839.

Beausoleil Island.
As a consequence of the 1836 purchase agreement with Bond Head, the Ojibwe were required to abandon the villages built for them by Colborne. In 1842, Aisance and his band left Coldwater and relocated to <a href="Beausoleil%20Island">Beausoleil Island</a> in <a href="Georgian%20Bay">Georgian Bay</a>, a move that brought them closer to their chief's native country around Penetanguishene. Henceforth the Chippewas of Beausoleil Island conducted themselves as a distinct people from Musquakie's band, who had settled at Rama.

Under Aisance's leadership, the Beausoleil settlement prospered modestly in stark contrast to the decay that reportedly took place at Rama. The Ojibwe, numbering 232 persons in 1842, grew steadily more able at growing corn and potatoes, rearing livestock, and making sugar, and their settlement grew slowly, eventually adding a school house. Notwithstanding a promising beginning, Aisance, frustrated by the poor soils on the island (which some blamed on the Ojibwe's cultivating technique), almost immediately hatched a plan for relocating westwards to the more fertile <a href="Christian%20Island">Christian Island</a> which the chief did not live to see come to fruition. In 1856, the Chippewas of Beausoleil Island joined "a few Pottawatamies and Ottawas" already settled on Christian Island, their arrival marking the beginnings of the present-day Beausoleil First Nation, whose <a href="Christian%20Island%2030">main reserve</a> is still on Christian Island.

Death.
John Aisance died in 1847, reportedly drowning in a canoeing accident.

Ten Years in Manitoba

Ten Years in Manitoba is a <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> documentary film, directed by <a href="James%20Freer">James Freer</a> and released in 1898. Although now lost, it is generally credited as the first known film by a Canadian filmmaker. Consisting of footage of various scenes from the province of <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, the film was exhibited in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in April 1898 as part of a promotional campaign, sponsored by the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>, to encourage <a href="immigration">immigration</a> to the province.

The film was a compilation of short scenes, with titles including "Six Binders at Work in Hundred Acre Wheatfield", "Harvesting Scene, with Trains Passing By", "Pacific and Atlantic Mail Trains" and "Arrival of CPR Express at Winnipeg". Other scenes whose titles are not confirmed reportedly depicted Freer's own home and family, as well as footage of <a href="Thomas%20Greenway">Thomas Greenway</a>, the Premier of Manitoba, <a href="stook">stook</a>ing grain on his own farm.

The <a href="Manitoba%20Historical%20Society">Manitoba Historical Society</a> has, however, confirmed that at least part of Freer's film appears to have consisted of footage filmed by other people; several months earlier, a Winnipeg bartender named Richard Hardie, an American filmmaker named E. H. Amet and entertainment producer named Cosgrove were known to have been exhibiting <a href="kinetograph">kinetograph</a>s in various Manitoba communities that included farm harvesting footage, including Greenway stooking grain, although they engaged in a dispute through letters to the "<a href="Winnipeg%20Free%20Press">Winnipeg Free Press</a>" as to who had been the creator of the films. Freer appears to have acquired their films, and included them in "Ten Years in Manitoba" along with some of his own original footage.

Angel (Fifth Harmony song)

"Angel" is a song recorded by American group <a href="Fifth%20Harmony">Fifth Harmony</a> for their <a href="Fifth%20Harmony%20%28album%29">self-titled third studio album</a> (2017). The song was produced by <a href="Skrillex">Skrillex</a> and <a href="Poo%20Bear">Poo Bear</a>. It was released as a promotional single on August 10, 2017.

Composition.
"Angel" incorporates a <a href="trap%20music">trap</a>-inflected sound with Mike Wass from <a href="Idolator%20%28website%29">Idolator</a> writing that it finds the group veering "deep into <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> territory." Its production is supported by heavy <a href="bass%20%28sound%29">bassline</a>, <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a> sound, "squiggly <a href="synths">synths</a>" and <a href="distortion%20%28music%29">distorted</a> vocal samples. The song is about being in a relationship based on unrealistic expectations. As <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a>'s writer Madeline Roth commented, the group "warning that they have no problem shrugging off a fuckboy if it needs to be." The group delivers a <a href="Rapping">half-rapped</a> performance on the first and second verses of the song, while in the <a href="Refrain">chorus</a>, they raise a <a href="rhetorical%20question">rhetorical question</a>, "When you look at me, what do you see? / Open your eyes, I’m more brilliant than you’ll ever be / Who said I was an angel?” the group continue to ask the same question throughout the record, as Rachael Ellenbogen from <a href="International%20Business%20Times">International Business Times</a> commented.

Critical reception.
Sadie Bell from "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" considered "Angel" as a "different direction" for the group describing it as "a bit harder than their more recent releases." Madeline Roth of MTV News praised its production and felt that "Angel" is "less poppier" than Fifth Harmony's previous single “<a href="Down%20%28Fifth%20Harmony%20song%29">Down</a>", providing a "harder backdrop for their brassiness."

Music video.
The song's official music video was released on August 11, 2017 and directed by David Camarena. The clip opens in a dimly lit setting, featuring a man who's been dreaming in his sleep, then it features the group in an entirely new light, in which they are revealed to be the subject of the man's dream, tormenting the dreams of someone who had wronged them, complete with flashing images and dark vcr filters, and neon lighting aesthetics.

Evelyn Payne Davis

Evelyn Payne Davis (born Evelyn Aramburo; December 27, 1921 - January 10, 1997) was an American community organizer, nonprofit executive and founder of the New York chapter of the <a href="National%20Coalition%20of%20100%20Black%20Women">National Coalition of 100 Black Women</a> volunteer organization. She is best known for her role as an ambassador for the children's television program "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>" within inner-city African American neighborhoods in the late 1960s.

Early life and education.
Davis was born Evelyn Aramburo in New Orleans, and at an early age moved to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> with her family, settling in Harlem. She attended Hunter High School and graduated from Hunter College in the City of New York. After college, she became active in President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>'s <a href="War%20on%20Poverty">War on Poverty</a> movement, volunteering in local programs and joining the New York chapter of the <a href="Urban%20League">Urban League</a>.

Career.
In 1969, as executives at <a href="Children%27s%20Television%20Workshop">Children's Television Workshop</a> were devising a marketing strategy for "Sesame Street" (then an experimental television venture), CTW founder <a href="Joan%20Ganz%20Cooney">Joan Ganz Cooney</a> was in need for someone who was intimately familiar with inner-city black communities, and who could communicate to families the benefits and aims of the new program. "Sesame Street" at the time was being broadcast on <a href="UHF%20television%20broadcasting">UHF networks</a>, which were fraught with viewer accessibility and regulatory issues. To find out how to maximize the show's viewership among African Americans, Cooney dialed James E. Booker, a prominent New York-based black publicist, who in turn contacted Davis, who at the time was the director for fund development at the New York Urban League. After meeting with Cooney, Davis agreed to head "Sesame Street"'s black viewer outreach, taking on the position of vice president of CTW's Community Education Services division. Davis's efforts succeeded: by the time "Sesame Street" reached its tenth anniversary in 1979, the program was reaching more than 90 percent of children in low-income urban areas.

In addition to her work with "Sesame Street" and CTW, Davis worked to improve the plight of African American women and children in New York City. In the wake of the turbulent 1968 <a href="King%20assassination%20riots">King assassination riots</a>, Davis and other black women community leaders joined to create the New York chapter of the Coalition of 100 Black Women; she became the organization's first president in 1972.

Death.
Davis passed away at the age of 75 from lung cancer in 1997. She was survived by a son, stepdaughter and two granddaughters.

Hokkien culture

Hokkien culture (<a href="Hokkien">Hokkien</a> <a href="Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB">Pe̍h-ōe-jī</a>: Bân-lâm bûn-hòa; <a href="Traditional%20Chinese">Traditional Chinese</a>: 閩南文化), also called Hoklo culture or Minnan culture, refers to the culture of the <a href="Hokkien%20people">Hoklo people</a>, a <a href="Han%20Chinese%20subgroups">group of Han Chinese people</a> who have historically been the dominant demographic in the province of <a href="Fujian">Fujian</a> (called "Hokkien" in the Hoklo language) in Southern <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, and certain <a href="overseas%20Chinese">overseas Chinese</a> communities in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>.

This culture has been influenced by the cultures from <a href="Minyue">Minyue</a> (a branch of <a href="Baiyue">Baiyue</a> people who inhabited Hokkien before <a href="sinicization">sinicization</a> of the region), <a href="Zhongyuan">China's Central Plain</a> (most notably during <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a> and <a href="Song%20Dynasty">Song Dynasty</a>), and <a href="Japan">Japan</a> (due to Taiwan being a <a href="Taiwan%20under%20Japanese%20rule">former Japanese colony</a>). It encompasses the <a href="Hokkien%20language">Hoklo language</a> and its associated architecture, folk arts, cuisines, and large amount of folklore. Since 
17th century, Hokkien culture has spread with Hoklo immigration to Taiwan, Singapore, and Southeast Asia. Its influence today can be seen in Taiwanese pop culture, resulting in it becoming an influential cultural force in <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>.

Traditional language.
Hokkien language.
The Hokkien language (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Bân-lâm-gú'; Traditional Chinese: 閩南儂), also called "Hoklo language" or "Southern Min language", belongs to the <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese language</a> family and is an <a href="isolating%20language">isolating language</a>. It is the product of the language spoken by the original Minyue people and that of the later arriving Han Chinese: Large number of Han Chinese people migrated to Hokkien between 7th to 13th century from Northern China, which was then invaded by ethnic groups such as the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a>, and intermixed with Minyue people. The intermixing is reflected by the fact that (1) modern day Hoklo people are, genetically, the hybrid descendants of Minyue and Ancient Han Chinese; and that (2) modern Hokkien language shows traits of both the Minyue language and <a href="Old%20Chinese">Old Chinese</a>.

Due to the historic migration of Hoklo people to Taiwan, Singapore, and Southeast Asia, the Hokkien language has spread far beyond its traditional homeland of Hokkien. In each of these areas, local forms of Hokkien can be found and show influences from nearby languages. <a href="Taiwanese%20Hokkien">Taiwanese Hokkien</a>, for instance, has been influenced by <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> and <a href="Formosan%20languages">Formosan languages</a> (languages spoken by <a href="Taiwanese%20aboriginals">Taiwanese aboriginals</a>), while <a href="Singaporean%20Hokkien">Singaporean Hokkien</a> contains many loanwords from <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> and <a href="English%20language">English</a>. These various forms of Hokkien are, however, still similar enough to be largely <a href="mutually%20intelligible">mutually intelligible</a> with one another.

Written Hokkien.
In terms of <a href="writing%20system">writing system</a>s, Hokkien gained one as early as the first half of 16th century (<a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a>) - with the play "<a href="Tale%20of%20the%20Lychee%20Mirror">Tale of the Lychee Mirror</a>" (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Nāi-kèng-kì; Traditional Chinese: 荔鏡記), which is fairly popular among Hoklo people even to this day. Later in 18th century, <a href="Koa-%C3%A1%20books">Koa-á books</a>, a form of <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a> Hokkien <a href="literature">literature</a>, gained popularity and attempted to use <a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese characters</a> to write the Hokkien language. Written Hokkien saw further development in 19th century. At that period, <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian Christian</a> sought to spread Presbyterianism in the Hokkien region and devised the "<a href="Pe%CC%8Dh-%C5%8De-j%C4%AB">Pe̍h-ōe-jī</a>" - a Hokkien writing system that uses <a href="Latin%20alphabets">Latin alphabets</a> - in <a href="Amoy">Amoy</a> (known as "Xiamen" in Mandarin), Hokkien.

Japan, while colonizing Taiwan, also developed the <a href="Taiwanese%20kana">Taiwanese kana</a> writing system.

Architecture.
The traditional architectural style of Hoklo people is largely similar to those of surrounding Han Chinese groups. There are, however, several features that are unique or mostly unique to Hoklo-made buildings, making many traditional buildings in Hokkien and Taiwan visually distinctive from those outside the region.

Swallowtail roof.
Swallowtail roof (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: ìnn-bé-tsiah; Traditional Chinese: 燕尾脊, literally "swallowtail ridge") is a feature rarely (if at all) seen in non-Hoklo Han Chinese architecture. It is very common in Hokkien and Taiwan. The term refers to a roof that has an upward-curving ridge shaped like the tail of a <a href="swallow">swallow</a>. The degree of curving may vary. The "swallowtail" in question can be single- or double-layered and is typically decorated with a large amount of colorful carvings. This feature originated in 16th century (Ming Dynasty). At that time, Hoklo people suddenly became rich from doing business with <a href="Western%20European">Western European</a> merchants, and decided that they would like to show off their newfound wealth - resulting in this garish architectural style. Due to its bright and showy nature, this architectural feature is commonly found in major temples, mansions, and <a href="ancestral%20hall">ancestral hall</a>s.

Cut porcelain carving.
Cut porcelain carving (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tsián-huî-tiau; Traditional Chinese: 剪瓷雕) is also prevalent among Hoklo architecture and, to a lesser extent, <a href="Vietnamese%20architecture">Vietnamese one</a>. Traditionally, Hoklo porcelain artists would often gather small colored porcelain artifacts (such as bowls and other eating utensils), cut and/or grind them into smaller fragments, and then paste these fragments onto sculptures attached to buildings for the purpose of decoration. This art is frequently used on the ridges, window frames, and doors of temples and larger residence, often in conjunction with swallowtail roof. The topic of these sculptures may vary - ranging from plants and animals to figures from <a href="Chinese%20mythology">Chinese mythology</a>. In Taiwan, a new style has even been formed by combining cut porcelain carving with <a href="cochin%20ware">cochin ware</a>.

Others.
Hokkien earthen buildings.
Hokkien earthen buildings (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Hok-kiàn thóo-lâu; Traditional Chinese: 福建土樓, literally "Hokkien earthen building"), called "Fujian Tulou" in <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a>, is another distinct type of architecture found in the Hokkien region. It is a set of large, enclosed and fortified earth buildings associated with the <a href="Hakka%20people">Hakka people</a>, who speak the <a href="Hakka%20language">Hakka language</a>, rather than Hoklo. However, it has been noted that this style of architecture is found almost exclusively among Hakka people in Hokkien and thus has become associated with the region.

Hokkien Sanheyuan.
<a href="Sanheyuan">Sanheyuan</a> (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Sam-ha̍h-īnn; Traditional Chinese: 三合院, literally "Three-combo building") is a type of building found throughout most of the <a href="Greater%20China%20region">Greater China region</a>. They are residence with structures on three sides of a courtyard, forming an inverted U-shape. While this style is shared by nearly all Han Chinese groups, Hokkien Sanheyuan have been noted to use multiple wings (called "protecting dragons" in Taiwan) to spread outward, a trait quite distinctive to Hoklo.
Fine arts.
Minnan school of painting.
Minnan school of painting (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Bân-lâm uē-phài; Traditional Chinese: 閩南畫派) is a school of <a href="painting">painting</a> invented by Hoklo people in Hokkien. It was invented in mid-20th century by a group of Hoklo painters in <a href="Quanzhou">Chinchew</a>, Hokkien. This style was characterized by a strong urge to break conventions in traditional Han Chinese paintings and adoption of modern European artistic ideals. It has been influenced by <a href="impressionism">impressionism</a>, <a href="fauvism">fauvism</a>, and <a href="cubism">cubism</a>, but retained many techniques used in traditional Han Chinese paintings. Despite being rather obscure outside Hokkien, it has seen an increase in popularity among Hoklo in early 21st century.

Minnan style of calligraphy.
Hoklo people have also used a considerable amount of calligraphy as decorations for their traditional buildings. The potential of Minnan style of calligraphy (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Bân-lâm su-hong; Traditional Chinese: 閩南書風) has come under the attention of Chinese cultural scholars in late 2000s. Deeper studies are being conducted on the traditional calligraphy of Hokkien.

Craftsmanship.
Tek-hòe porcelain.
Tek-hòe porcelain (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tek-hòe hûi; Traditional Chinese: 德化陶瓷) is a type of white <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a> that originated from the city of <a href="Dehua">Tek-hòa</a> (called "Dehua" in <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a>), Hokkien. This style of porcelain began in 14th to 15th century (Ming Dynasty), and, according to some sources, perhaps even earlier than that. This style is noted for using <a href="Kaolinite">Kaolinite</a> to create very detailed and delicate porcelains, and also for the products' pure, ivory-like white coloring and resemblance to archaic ritual objects. With the Hokkien coast being a major ceramic exporting center at that time, Tek-hòe porcelain products have been sold to Western European merchants and given the name ""Blanc de Chine"" (literally "White of China") by the <a href="French%20people">French</a>. Even in the 21st century, Hoklo people are still keeping the tradition of making Tek-hòe porcelain alive, and this style is used in many types of products, ranging from purely artistic ones (e.g., sculptures) to more practical ones (e.g., eating utensils).

Lacquer thread sculpture.
Lacquer thread sculpture (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tshat-suànn tiau; Traditional Chinese: 漆線雕, literally "painted wire carving"), sometimes translated as "paint line carving" in English, is a traditional folk art in Hokkien, having originated in Amoy before 18th century. This folk art involves wrapping fine, usually golden filigree-like threads around other artifacts to form images of characters and animals. It is most typically used on Buddhist statues and vases for the purpose of decoration. It was traditionally passed only to male heirs but is now passed to Hoklo of either gender. As of 2006, it has formally been declared an <a href="intangible%20cultural%20heritage">intangible cultural heritage</a> by China.

A video of <a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DpRcD-yDdY_E">the process of making lacquer thread sculpture</a> (in Mandarin) is available on youtube.

Hua'an jade.
Hua'an jade (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Hua-an gi̍k; Traditional Chinese: 華安玉) is a type of <a href="hornfel">hornfel</a>s with green bands consisting of <a href="epidote">epidote</a> and <a href="diopside">diopside</a>, known to be found primarily in Hokkien, China. It is noted for being dense, resistant to wearing, and having very irregular coloring and texture. This type of jade is frequently used in jewellery and carvings made in Hokkien.

Performing arts.
Hoklo have historically been prolific producers of music and operas, most of which are sung and expressed using the Hokkien language. Music and opera types that originated in or are associated with the Hokkien-speaking region include:

Glove puppetry.
Glove puppetry (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Pò͘-tē-hì; Traditional Chinese: 布袋戲, literally "cloth bag opera") is by far the best-known opera form of Hokkien origin. It originated in Hokkien in around 17th century, and is a form of opera that uses <a href="cloth">cloth</a> puppets and music to tell stories. Puppets used in glove puppetry have hollow heads carved with wood. Their palms and feet are also made of wood, but the torso and limbs consist entirely of cloth costumes. During a performance, a gloved hand enters the puppet's costume and make it move. The puppets used in these shows used to strongly resemble cloth sacks, hence the name "cloth bag opera".

Philosophy.
Min school.
Min school (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Bân-ha̍k; Traditional Chinese: 閩學) is a <a href="Neo-confucianism">Neo-confucian</a> school founded primarily by Hoklo scholars, with the Hokkien-born <a href="Gan%20Chinese-speaking%20people">Gonin</a> <a href="Zhu%20Xi">Tsu Hi</a> being the leading figure. The Min school is said to be marked by (1) an emphasis on the Four Books: the "<a href="Great%20Learning">Great Learning</a>", the "<a href="Doctrine%20of%20the%20Mean">Doctrine of the Mean</a>", the "<a href="Analects%20of%20Confucius">Analects of Confucius</a>", and the "<a href="Mencius%20%28book%29">Mencius</a>"; (2) a tendency to interpret <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> from the lens of <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>; (3) placing importance on self-perfection. Philosophy of the Min school was passed to <a href="Korea">Korea</a> and <a href="Japan">Japan</a> through cultural exchange during the Ming Dynasty.

Science and inventions.
Shipbuilding.
The Minyue people - the original inhabitants of Hokkien before sinicization of the region - were known for their skills in <a href="shipbuilding">shipbuilding</a>. Even the ancient Han Chinese, who were by far the most advanced people in the region at that time, took note of Minyue's shipbuilding skills. For most of the first millennium AD, <a href="Port%20of%20Meizhou%20Bay">Port of Meizhou Bay</a> of Chinchew has been one of the greatest ports of the Chinese Empire. Later, during 6th to 9th century (<a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a>), peoples in Hokkien were said to be able to build large ships of 50 to 60 tonnes, which was very remarkable for that time period . Hokkien remained the leading shipbuilding center for the Chinese Empire in the six centuries that followed, resulting in a strong shipbuilding tradition among Hoklo.

Cultural symbols.
Narcissus.
<a href="Narcissus%20%28plant%29">Narcissus</a> (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tsuí-sian; Traditional Chinese: 水仙) is the official provincial flower of Hokkien. In the Hokkien-speaking region, it regularly appears in names for places and buildings.

Graceful Explosion Machine

Graceful Explosion Machine is a 2-D, side-scrolling <a href="shoot%20%27em%20up">shoot 'em up</a> developed by Vertex Pop. It was first released in North America and Europe for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> on April 6, 2017 and later for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> on August 8, 2017 in the North American and North European regions. The game has received positive reviews from critics.

Reception.
According to <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, the Switch version received a 77/100 from 19 critics indicating "generally favorable reviews". Mitch Vogel of <a href="Nintendo%20Life">Nintendo Life</a> gave the game a 9/10, calling it "an arcade shooter with a lot of style and a surprising ammount of substance". He praised the weapons in the game, noting how each individual weapon's strengths and weeknesses ecourage the player to use their full arsenal. He also noted the game's replay value and found it "incredibly satisfying" to return to previous levels to get a high score.

Writing for <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, Jose Otero liked how each enemy had their own attack patterns which gave them "loads of personality" despite being composed of "basic shapes".

A more negative review came from GamesRadar's David Roberts who gave the game a 3/5. He praised the game's "colorful, candy colored" graphics and the audio cues that "let you know when to lay off the blaster or grab more gems" but lamented that "once you've played the first few stages you've seen pretty much everything it has to offer" and that "each stage takes way to long to complete" attributing the latter to five-minute stages that, for the majority of the time, are spent on "mindless fodder" in between the "larger and more interesting enemies. Ultimately, he called Graceful Explosion Machine a "decent enough distraction" that "allows you to turn your brain off" when the player has a few minutes to kill.

Gun Monkeys

Gun Monkeys is a side-scrolling multiplayer shooter video game developed and published by <a href="Size%20Five%20Games">Size Five Games</a>. It was released on June 28, 2013 for Windows and Mac OS X on the <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> platform. It was later removed for sale from Steam.

The game received mixed reception from critics, who praised the gameplay but criticized the difficulty of finding anyone to play against in the online multiplayer mode.

Gameplay.
The game takes place in an arena where monkeys with guns are pitted against each other. Players must grab "energy cubes" and return them to their base, with each player death reducing that player's energy by 1. If the energy of one of the players reaches zero, they lose.

The game's arenas are <a href="Procedural%20generation">procedurally generated</a> and contain environmental hazards. The game supports both local and online play. Ingame cash gained in the online mode can be used to unlock various perks.

Development.
The game was originally released at a price of $9.99. While it broke even with development costs, the game still faced issues with the low amount of people playing it online, which was a problem due to its multiplayer focus. Therefore, the price was dropped to $5.99 and was bundled in packs of two, with one giftable to a friend. The game's developer, Dan Marshall, stated that "the number of games you have to sell in order to have people playing constantly is HUGE", saying that for indie developers, such a thing "might not happen". The price drop was "reluctant" due to Marshall's dislike of the "devaluation" of indie games. For the same reason, the game was later updated to generate free Steam keys for players who waited too long for an online game.

Reception.
The game's reception from critics was mixed. Chris Carter of <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> rated the game 75/100, calling it "simple" but "a great way to spend a weekend", saying that the matches were "high-octane" and "skill-heavy". <a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge Magazine</a> rated the game 7/10, calling the matches "surprisingly tactical" and calling the voice-over featuring <a href="Kevin%20Eldon">Kevin Eldon</a> "ideal". <a href="GamesTM">GamesTM</a> called the game "tremendous, if rather basic, fun".

Music.
Because of the less than serious nature of the project, the music of "The Unholy Handjob" is based around simplified riffs and notably more <a href="alternative%20metal">alternative metal</a>-based than its predecessor, which was firmly rooted in noisy <a href="garage%20rock">garage rock</a> and <a href="sludge%20metal">sludge metal</a>. The track "Pricks Are Heavy" is a live performance of the band opening for <a href="L7%20%28band%29">L7</a> at <a href="Whisky%20a%20Go%20Go">Whisky a Go Go</a>.

Reception.
<a href="Ned%20Raggett">Ned Raggett</a>, who had written a positive review of the bannd's debut, was critical of "The Unholy Handjob". He gave the album two-and-a-half out of five stars, saying "the vocalist (clearly not <a href="Jello%20Biafra">Biafra</a>, that much is clear) aims for yelled pseudo-metal smoothness, if such a thing exists, and the riffs and songs are as rockingly clichéd as they get. If <a href="Butt%20Trumpet">Butt Trumpet</a>, say, had done this kind of thing, nobody would have noticed much about it, and if it had been marketed as a direct parody, doubtless little would have cared."

Glycan array

Glycan arrays, like that offered by the <a href="Consortium%20for%20Functional%20Glycomics">Consortium for Functional Glycomics</a> (CFG), contain carbohydrate compounds that can be screened with lectins, antibodies or cell receptors to define carbohydrate specificity and identify ligands. Glycan array screening works in much the same way as other microarray that is used for instance to study gene expression <a href="DNA%20microarrays">DNA microarrays</a> or protein interaction <a href="Protein%20microarray">Protein microarray</a>s.

Glycan arrays are composed of various <a href="oligosaccharides">oligosaccharides</a> and/or <a href="polysaccharides">polysaccharides</a> immobilised on a solid support in a spatially-defined arrangement. This technology provides the means of studying glycan-protein interactions in a high-throughput environment. These natural or synthetic (see <a href="carbohydrate%20synthesis">carbohydrate synthesis</a>) glycans are then incubated with any glycan-binding protein such as <a href="lectin">lectin</a>s, <a href="cell%20surface%20receptor">cell surface receptor</a>s or possibly a whole organism such as a <a href="virus">virus</a>. Binding is quantified using fluorescence-based detection methods.

Applications.
The glycan array technology has been and still is applied to study the specificity of <a href="host-pathogen%20interactions">host-pathogen interactions</a>.
Early on, glycan arrays were proven useful in determining the specificity of the <a href="Hemagglutinin%20%28influenza%29">Hemagglutinin (influenza)</a> of the <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus">Influenza A virus</a> binding to the host and distinguishing across different strains of flu (including avian from mammalian). This was shown with CFG arrays as well as customised arrays. 
Cross-platform benchmarks led to highlight the effect of glycan presentation and spacing on binding.

Glycan arrays are possibly combined with other techniques such as <a href="Surface%20Plasmon%20Resonance">Surface Plasmon Resonance</a> (SPR) to refine the characterisation of glycan-binding. For example, this combination led to demonstrate the calcium-dependent heparin binding of <a href="Annexin%20A1">Annexin A1</a> that is involved in several biological processes including <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>, <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> and <a href="membrane%20trafficking">membrane trafficking</a>.

This responsibility grew over the years to include combat documentation, automatic gun-camera and high-speed pod and blister photography of ordnance deliveries, still photography, and photographic support of the <a href="Vietnamese%20Air%20Force">Vietnamese Air Force</a> (VNAF).

The first commander of the 600th Photo Squadron was Colonel James P. Warndorf.

By 1968, the 600th Photo Squadron Detachments in Vietnam were:

In addition to the 9 detachments in South Vietnam, the 600th PS also oversaw OL-1 (Operating Location 1), which was assigned to HQ <a href="Military%20Assistance%20Command%2C%20Vietnam">Military Assistance Command, Vietnam</a> (MACV) in Saigon. The "MACV Team", as it was known, was free to document all branches of the armed forces in South Vietnam per the request of HQ MACV. The MACV team covered stories on the USAF, USA, US Navy, Marines, the <a href="Royal%20Thai%20Air%20Force">Royal Thai Air Force</a> and combat units from Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the Philippines.

The Squadron was supported by the 400th Aero Squadron nicknamed "SCATBACK" which was responsible for the pickup of unprocessed film and the delivery of processed film within a 24-hour turnaround time.

By 1968, the 601st Photo Flight, with headquarters at <a href="Korat%20Royal%20Thai%20Air%20Force%20Base">Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base</a> (RTAB), had also been formed and was operating out of 6 <a href="Royal%20Thai%20Air%20Force">Royal Thai Air Force</a> bases. The 601st Photo Flight Detachments in Thailand were:

Between 1966 and 1976, the 600th Photo Squadron lost 11 combat cameramen killed-in-action. Four were killed in 1968 at the height of U.S. combat operations in Vietnam.

Tenrikyo Church Headquarters

Tenrikyo Church Headquarters ("Tenrikyo Kyokai Honbu" 天理教教会本部) is the main <a href="headquarters">headquarters</a> of the <a href="Tenrikyo">Tenrikyo</a> <a href="religion">religion</a>, located in <a href="Tenri%2C%20Nara">Tenri</a>, <a href="Nara%20Prefecture">Nara</a>, Japan. This establishment is significant to followers because it is built around the "Jiba", the spot where followers believe the god <a href="Tenri-O-no-Mikoto">Tenri-O-no-Mikoto</a> conceived humankind.

History.
Background.
Due to constant persecution from local government authorities and from members of established religions, the followers of Tenrikyo wanted to apply for legal authorization to establish a church. However, <a href="Meiji%20Constitution">Japanese law during the Meiji period</a> stipulated that legal authorization could only be granted if the church were classified under an established tradition, such as <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, or <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Though Tenrikyo does not consider itself a Shinto tradition, early followers agreed to file under Shinto in order to obtain the protections from legal authorization. Several failed attempts were made; the first one was in April 29, 1885 to the governor of Osaka Prefecture.

Under Shinto Main Bureau (1888–1899).
Tenrikyo Church Headquarters was established in <a href="1888">1888</a> as a religious organization belonging to the <a href="Shinto%20Taikyo">Shinto Main Bureau</a> (神道本局 "Shinto Honkyoku"). The legal authorization removed the threat of suppression and allowed followers could seek permission to establish branch churches and to gain official recognition for <a href="missionary">missionary</a> work. The membership rose sharply in the first decade of the Headquarters' existence. In 1892, the number of Tenrikyo followers had allegedly reached over one million, a thirty-fold increase in membership in five years. By December 1896, Tenrikyo had 3,137,113 members belonging to 1,078 churches, and there were 19,061 ministers. This growth invited negative reactions from Buddhist institutions, which were concerned about losing adherents, and from newspapers, who labeled the religion as "anti-social."

On April 6, 1896, the <a href="Home%20Ministry">Home Ministry</a> (内務省 "Naimu-shō") issued "Directive No. 12," which ordered strict and secretive surveillance over Tenrikyo Church Headquarters under the pretense of maintaining and strengthening the <a href="kokutai">state polity</a> of Japan. Issues raised by authorities were the congregation of both men and women together, the obstruction of medical treatment and the alleged policy of enforced donations."

The Tenrikyo leaders complied to the state's demands in several ways. They changed several aspects of their prayer ritual, known to adherents as the "Service". The name of the Tenrikyo deity <a href="Tenri-O-no-Mikoto">Tenri-O-no-Mikoto</a> was changed to Tenri-no-Okami. Tenrikyo's doctrine was altered to conform with the official <a href="State%20Shinto">State Shinto</a> doctrine. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters' conformity with the state demands resulted in a dual structure of the Tenrikyo faith, where on the surface, Tenrikyo complied with the state demands, while adherents disregarded those changes and maintained the teachings and rites as initially taught by <a href="Miki%20Nakayama">Miki Nakayama</a>.

Preparing for independence from Shinto Main Bureau (1899–1908).
In 1899 the Shinto Main Bureau advised the Tenrikyo Church Headquarters officials about the possibility of official recognition as an independent religion (independent meaning to be classified directly under the <a href="Government%20of%20Meiji%20Japan">Meiji government</a>, which upheld State Shinto ideology). Tenrikyo leaders worked to systemize the Tenrikyo doctrine and institutionalize the organization so that the petition for independence would pass. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters made a total of five attempts before it finally achieved independence in 1908.

On April 1, 1900, Tenri Seminary, Tenrikyo’s first educational institution, was founded as a training school for ministers. In 1902, Tenrikyo arranged its mission administration system in Japan, which divided the country into ten dioceses and appointed superintendents to supervise regional missionary activities.

In 1903, a edition of Tenrikyo's doctrine was compiled (known today as the "Meiji kyoten", or the <a href="Meiji%20period">Meiji</a> version of Tenrikyo's doctrine). This edition of the doctrine differs significantly from the present edition because the teachings of State Shinto were incorporated in order to gain the Home Ministry's approval. Although Tenrikyo Church Headquarters complied with many of the state's requests, it did not compromise on the request to completely eliminate the "<a href="Mikagura-uta">Mikagura-uta</a>" ("The Songs for the Service"), one of Tenrikyo's main scriptures.

Around this time, Tenrikyo began to open its first churches overseas in <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> (1897), <a href="Korea">Korea</a> (1904), <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> (1911), the <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a> (1927), <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asian</a> countries.

Independence from Shinto Main Bureau (1908–1937).
The fifth petition for independence was submitted to the Home Ministry on March 20, 1908 and accepted later that year in November 27. Tenrikyo Church Headquarters set up its Administrative Headquarters, formally appointed Shinnosuke Nakayama as the first "shinbashira", the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo, and established its constitution. On February 25, 1912, the Home Ministry invited representatives from seventy-three religious groups to the (三教会同 "Sankyokaido") including a Tenrikyo representative (the three religions represented were Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity, and Tenrikyo was categorized under Shinto). This conference initiated a program of national edification, and with the support of the government, Tenrikyo was able to hold lectures at 2,074 places through Japan, drawing nearly a quarter million listeners. Due to the relative relaxation of state control on Tenrikyo rituals, the performance of <a href="Mikagura-uta%23Section%20One">section one of the Mikagura-uta</a> was restored in 1916, after two decades of prohibition under the Home Ministry’s directive. 

In 1925, a school of foreign languages was established for missionaries, including what would become <a href="Tenri%20Central%20Library">Tenri Central Library</a>. The same year saw the establishment of a printing office, a department for researching of doctrinal and biographical materials, and a major expansion of the church's education system, including a new girls’ school, nursery, kindergarten, and elementary school. 

In 1928, the "<a href="Ofudesaki">Ofudesaki</a>" was published. Three years later, in 1931, the publication of the "<a href="Osashizu">Osashizu</a>" was completed, making the three main scriptures of Tenrikyo available to all followers for the first time. 

On the occasion of the completion of the South Worship Hall of the Main Sanctuary in 1934, the <a href="Mikagura-uta%23Songs%20for%20the%20Kagura%20Service">Kagura Service</a> was restored for the first time since it had been prohibited in 1896.

Wartime Japan (1937–1945).
As the war between Japan and China grew from the <a href="Mukden%20Incident">Mukden Incident</a> to the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a>, state control of religious and secular thought intensified. For example, in December 1935, state authorities destroyed the buildings of <a href="%C5%8Cmoto">Omotokyo</a> Headquarters and arrested the organization's leaders. One week later, on December 16, 1935, around four hundred policemen were sent to investigate Tenrikyo Church Headquarters on suspicion of tax evasion, even though there were no grounds for that accusation.

After the <a href="National%20Mobilization%20Law">National Mobilization Law</a> was passed in 1938, Japan’s wartime polity strengthened. In 1939, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters announced that it would reform its doctrine and ritual, under threat of forced disbanding of the organization by state authorities. Under the reformation, copies of the "Ofudesaki" and "Osashizu" were recalled, certain chapters were deleted from the "Mikagura-uta", and the Kagura Service, an important Tenrikyo ritual, was not allowed to be performed. All preaching, rites, and events were to follow the Meiji version of Tenrikyo's doctrine from 1903. The 1940 <a href="Religious%20Organizations%20Law">Religious Organizations Law</a> further increased state surveillance and oppression in Japan.

After World War II (1945–present).
In its own historical account, Tenrikyo refers to the years following the <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">surrender of Japan</a> and the conclusion of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> as "fukugen", or "restoration." One of the significant aspects of the "restoration" was the republishing and reissuing of the three scriptures of Tenrikyo in their entirety: the "<a href="Mikagura-uta">Mikagura-uta</a>" in 1946, the "<a href="Ofudesaki">Ofudesaki</a>" in 1948, and the "<a href="Osashizu">Osashizu</a>" in 1949. In addition, the doctrine, which for decades had been colored by State Shinto ideology, was revised to reflect the teachings conveyed in the main scriptures and authorized in 1949.

Another aspect of the "restoration" was the construction of the <a href="Oyasato-yakata">Oyasato-yakata</a>, begun in 1954. As of 1998, twenty four wings have been completed and are used for various purposes, such as educational facilities, medicinal facilities, institutes for doctrinal studies and religious training, and followers' dormitories. The construction continues to this day.

The "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue," a symposium cosponsored by <a href="Tenri%20University">Tenri University</a> and <a href="Pontifical%20Gregorian%20University">Pontifical Gregorian University</a>, was held in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a> from March 9–11, 1998. Three years later, the universities cosponsored another symposium, "Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue II," held at <a href="Tenri%2C%20Nara">Tenri, Japan</a> from September 28–30, 2002.

James Phipps of Cape Coast Castle

James Phipps (c.1687 – 15 January 1723) was at the heart of the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> in the early 18th century, being Captain-General of the <a href="Royal%20African%20Company">Royal African Company</a> and Governor of <a href="Cape%20Coast%20Castle">Cape Coast Castle</a> on the <a href="Gold%20Coast%20%28region%29">Gold Coast</a>.

Origins.
Phipps was one of at least five sons of the English merchant <a href="Thomas%20Phipps">Thomas Phipps</a> and his wife Bridget Short. The Phipps family had emerged in the 16th century as prominent clothiers in <a href="Westbury%2C%20Wiltshire">Westbury, Wiltshire</a>, where Thomas Phipps acquired an estate after a successful career in London, trading to East India, West Africa, and New England.

Career.
Phipps began his career with the Royal African Company in 1703. He served as writer (a junior employee) at Cape Coast Castle, as agent at <a href="Fort%20James%20%28Ghana%29">James Fort</a> in <a href="Accra">Accra</a>, and as Chief Agent and Warehouse-Keeper at Cape Coast Castle, before being appointed as the Company’s <a href="Captain%20general">Captain-General</a> (with both civil and military authority) on 23 July 1719. He was summarily dismissed after three years in post, for reasons that remain opaque, and died at Cape Coast Castle while awaiting a ship in which to return to England. Despite the long period of time which he spent in the Company’s service and the high rank which he attained, he never succeeded in making a substantial fortune, a failure which he himself attributed to his personal honesty. The value of his estate on his death was estimated at only £3,200.
The longevity of Phipps’s career was remarkable, given that the Company’s records for the period between 1684 and 1732 reveal an average annual death toll for men in the Company’s service on the Gold Coast of 27 percent.

Family.
Phipps had a long-lasting relationship with the mulatto daughter of a Dutch soldier, for whom he provided in his will and by whom he had four daughters and a son. His grandson by his daughter Bridget, <a href="James%20Townsend%20%28Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London%29">James Townsend</a>, became a Member of Parliament and <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a>.

Oakwood Park, Enfield

Oakwood Park is a public park in <a href="Oakwood%2C%20London">Oakwood</a>, in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Enfield">London Borough of Enfield</a>, on land that was formerly part of Enfield Chase. It opened in 1929 and comprises 64 acres of land. It is notable for its commemorative avenue of poplar trees, an avenue of scarlet oaks planted by mayors of Enfield, and an ice well that was built by <a href="Samuel%20Sugden%20%28merchant%29">Samuel Sugden</a>, on whose estate of Oak Lodge the park was largely built and after which it was named.

Location.
Oakwood Park is located immediately to the east of the <a href="Piccadilly%20Line">Piccadilly Line</a> between <a href="Oakwood%20tube%20station">Oakwood</a> and <a href="Southgate%20tube%20station">Southgate</a> stations. There are entrances from Saxon Way, Prince George Avenue, Willow Walk, and Oakwood Park Road.

Creation.
The park is on land that was formerly part of <a href="Enfield%20Chase">Enfield Chase</a>, a royal hunting ground. The Chase was enclosed in 1777 and subsequently divided between the King and the freeholders of the neighbouring parishes with the land now occupied by the park allocated to <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> parish, of which <a href="Southgate%2C%20London">Southgate</a> was then a part.

In the late 1860s, the merchant <a href="Samuel%20Sugden%20%28merchant%29">Samuel Sugden</a> (c.1800-1896) purchased a farm and farmhouse in the area. He rebuilt the house into a much more substantial residence known as Oak Lodge with a walled garden, orchard, <a href="ice%20well">ice well</a>, and a collection of outbuildings. The Lodge and outbuildings were demolished just after the end of the First World War and in 1927 <a href="Southgate%20Urban%20District%20Council">Southgate Urban District Council</a> purchased 50 acres from Sugden's estate which it combined with 8.5 acres it purchased from the <a href="Vicar%20of%20Enfield">Vicar of Enfield</a> to form Oakwood Park. The park opened in 1929 and after further adjustments caused by the construction of the Piccadilly Line northern extension (1932) now comprises 64 acres of land. The ice well still exists as do some of the original field boundaries dating from Sugden's time.

Features.
The park features a grove of <a href="Poplar%20tree">poplar</a> trees planted to mark the coronation of <a href="King%20George%20VI">King George VI</a> and an avenue of scarlet oak trees which was planted by successive mayors of the Borough of Enfield since 1945.

There is a tea room or cafe.

College career.
Coming out of high school, Walker had no scholarship offers. Instead, he secured a last-second offer through a connection his high school assistant coach had.

It was there that Walker found someone who believed in him—head coach Sam Walker. Devondrick said in January 2017, "I had an amazing head coach (Sam Walker).

Etymology.
The isle was once named "Batu Ferringhi" (<a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>: Portuguese Rock) and has lent its name to the now popular tourist destination of <a href="Batu%20Ferringhi">Batu Ferringhi</a>, a suburb of <a href="George%20Town%2C%20Penang">George Town</a>.

Gas venting

Gas venting is the intentional safe release, without combustion, into the earth's atmosphere of gases that cannot be readily recycled into a production process, are surplus to requirements and have no export route or market value. As an industry practice, it has been criticized for its <a href="human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">environmental impact</a> and is being phased out in favor of gas recompression/injection or <a href="gas%20flare">gas flaring</a>. Controlled gas venting should not be confused with <a href="gas%20leak">gas leak</a>s which are unintentional and must be eliminated as a risk to safe operations, emergency pressure relief of last resort to safeguard human life and prevent equipment from exploding, or confused with uncontrolled and/or undetected gas seepage from the earth or oceans.

Oil field practice relating to unwanted gas.
An example of gas venting from the <a href="oil%20industry">oil industry</a> is the atmospheric release of low pressure <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> or contaminated gas to a safe location and at a <a href="concentration">concentration</a> that avoids creation of a flammable or explosive mixture, or one that directly affects human health. Venting smaller volumes of low pressure gas can be the lowest cost and sometimes the only practicable option, particularly for limited durations and exceptional activities. Today, it is generally considered unacceptable in normal operations due to its environmental impact: natural gas has far greater <a href="global%20warming%20potential">global warming potential</a> before than after combustion to <a href="Carbon%20dioxide">CO</a> and often contains harmful contaminants prior to processing.

Historical context.
Natural gas was sometimes considered troublesome, dangerous, low value: a "free" by-product associated with financially more lucrative coal or liquid <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a> recovery that has to be dealt with. The growth of international gas markets, infrastructure and supply chains have done much to change this. It has become standard practice to capture and use associated gas to provide local power and to reinject re-compressed gas for secondary recovery, reservoir pressure maintenance and potential later reservoir depressurization once hydrocarbon liquids recovery has been maximized and a gas export infrastructure and market access have been established. Today, it is financially viable to develop even relatively small hydrocarbon reservoirs containing unassociated gas (i.e. with little or no oil) close to a market or export route, as well as large, remote accumulations.

Gas seepage as a result of human activity.
Human activity has increased the number of potential sources and pathways for natural gas to escape from the earth. Activities include not only hydrocarbon extraction, but also inadequate abandonment and decommissioning practices, insufficiently controlled burial of <a href="Decomposition">decomposing</a> rubbish and water wells into subsurface <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>s. Measures to minimize environmental impact include complete hydrocarbon reservoir depressurization, and capture or controlled combustion of <a href="firedamp">gases from coal mining</a> and of so-called <a href="biogas">biogas</a>es.

Other sources of gas release.
In practice, it is impossible or impractical to completely filter the air from <a href="coal%20mining">coal mining</a> and to degas hydrocarbon product and/or water produced from the ground which in some cases may be disposed at surface for and used after treatment. Melting of <a href="methane%20hydrate">methane hydrate</a>s in the world's oceans or sea ice would also constitute uncontrolled gas leakage to atmosphere.

Soon in the town appeared Russian Orthodox population, who needed their own churches.

St. Sophia Church was built in 1863 in Pervomayskaya Street. The church had one <a href="dome">dome</a> that was made of wood, stood on a stone basement and had a single-tier <a href="Belfry%20%28architecture%29">belfry</a>. Its height was 15 meters.

In 1904, instead of the wooden Sofia Church, the construction of a stone church designed by architect V. V. Popov began and was completed in 1912.

This church did not last for a quarter of a century. In 1934 it was closed and dismantled for building materials. At first, all the side domes and walls were removed, although the central dome had rested for some more time on four columns. In the end, these columns were also blown up.

In 2014, President Barzani described Germany as "one of Kurdistan Region’s staunch allies in the war against the <a href="Islamic%20State">Islamic State</a>." German Consul General Marc Eichhorn described the relations as "excellent".

History.
In 1992, the Kurds of Iraq established a mission in Berlin, establishing direct contacts with the German government. Furthermore, the mission had to coordinate humanitarian and development aid from Germany to the Kurdish region, and informed the German public and media about the general situation in Kurdistan.

Strengthening of ties and German aid to Kurdistan Region (2014-2017).
To combat Islamic State's advance into Northern parts of <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, the German government decided to aid the Kurdish soldiers (<a href="Peshmerga">Peshmerga</a>) militarily. Steinmeier stated that: "We cannot on the one hand praise the Kurdish security forces, pat them on the back for fighting ISIS on behalf of all of us, then when they ask for help just say ‘see how you get on’". The first dispatched aid containing non-lethal military equipment was sent in August 2014. In early September that year, Germany sent lethal equipment and logistics support including assault rifles, machine guns, pistols, anti-tank weapons, night-vision devices and radios. Aid which was enough to equip 4,000 Kurdish soldiers. Germany also established a military liaison team in Erbil to coordinate the distribution of the aid. This delivery amounted to 89 million dollars and was received by Kurdish authorities on the 5th September. On the 28th September 2014, German Defence Minister <a href="Ursula%20von%20der%20Leyen">Ursula von der Leyen</a> went to Erbil and stated that Germany would continue to support the Kurdish soldiers, and German soldiers commenced the training of Kurdish soldiers in October that year.

In January 2015, Defence Minister von der Leyen visited Kurdistan Region again and visited a camp where German soldiers trained Kurdish soldiers, where she commented the training and reassured that Germany would support Kurdistan further. During the <a href="Munich%20Security%20Conference">Munich Security Conference</a> in February 2015, Barzani met with Merkel and German Defence Minister von der Leyen to discuss the military aid for the Kurdish soldiers. On May 2015, Germany chose to send 500 more <a href="MILAN">MILAN anti-tank guided missiles</a>, 30 rocket launchers, panzerfaust rockets, G-3 and G-36 assault rifles and ammunition. From April to May 2015, five planeloads of military aid was dispatched for Kurdistan Region. In October 2015, Defece Minister von der Leyen stated that 4,700 Kurdish soldiers had been trained. In January 2016, Germany opened a training base in Erbil to train more Kurdish soldiers.

In August 2016, the German government mulled to send more military aid to Kurdistan Region, as a spokesperson from the German defense ministry stated that 70 tonnes of weapons had already been sent. The shipment was received by Kurdish authorities in early November 2016. German Foreign Minister <a href="Sigmar%20Gabriel">Sigmar Gabriel</a> met with President Barzani in April 2017 praising the Kurds' efforts against ISIS.

Describing itself as a ’game changing interactive attraction’, Orbi Dubai features a 360-degree, 4D cinema for screening BBC Earth wildlife footage, as well as a range of interactive games and exhibitions designed to educate visitors about the natural world.

Orbi Dubai is located inside City Centre Mirdif the retail complex in Dubai Mirdif area. 

Development History and Technology.
Orbi Dubai was officially opened on 7th May 2017 in a joint collaboration between the SEGA Holdings Company Ltd, BBC Worldwide and Dubai-based Majid Al Futtaim Leisure and Entertainment. It is the third Orbi attraction in the world and retains many of the original interactive exhibits which featured in the original <a href="Orbi">Orbi</a> entertainment facility, which opened in Yokohama, Japan, in August 2013. A second Orbi facility was opened in Osaka on 29th January 2016.

The technology behind the attractions for all three Orbi parks is supplied by multinational games developer <a href="SEGA">SEGA</a>. The video footage screened to visitors is provided by BBC Earth Production, and much of it is specially commissioned for Orbi.

Orbi Dubai.
All three Orbi parks were created with the intention of educating the public about the natural world through 4D interactive experiences. As with its Japanese counterparts, the centrepiece of Orbi Dubai is its ’Theatre 23.4’, a 35-metre-wide cinema screen used to project custom-made nature films from BBC Earth. Two additional screens positioned behind the audience create a full visual experience, which is accompanied by 3D sound designed to immerse visitors in the footage they are watching.

In order to create a 4D experience, SEGA Group has provided various pieces of technology which produce wind, fog, scents, and vibrations. The documentary films screened at Theatre 23.4 have all been specially produced for Orbi by BBC Earth Production, and have included features such as The Magic of Yellowstone and a study of the Meerkats of the Kalahari Desert.

Attractions.
In addition to Theatre 23.4, Orbi Dubai also features a number of interactive games and other exhibits.

The 4D Mountain Gorilla exhibition features a 3D film, moving seats and special effects involving surround sound and water, and is promoted as a way for visitors to experience a trek through the mountain forests of Central Africa as part of a BBC film crew.

The Blue Layer attraction is equipped with a twelve-metre wide circular screen, through which underwater footage is screened and facts about the marine life featured are displayed.

Also making use of 360-degree film screens, the Earth Palette show includes rolling footage of, full-colour images of the natural world, while Base Camp see images captured by BBC Earth projected onto the big screen and features pair of interactive sculptures.

The African Elephants exhibit explores the migration of African elephants through the wilderness and uses SEGA’s technology to recreate the vibrations of a herd on the move. Also making use of immersive technology, the Earth Cruising attraction simulates a flight across various landscapes with wind blowing effects.

Frozen: Mount Kenya takes visitors into sub-zero temperatures and features a wind chill simulator to recreate the conditions on Africa’s highest mountain. Infra-red cameras show how body temperatures fall in the harsh conditions at the top of a mountain.

Other interactive exhibits include the Time Slice interactive comparison, which encourages visitors to test their speed against some of the planet’s fastest animals, and the Extreme Photo Spot, a green screen experience which allows people to pose against backdrops featuring landscapes and wildlife. Animalpedia sees various life-sized animals projected onto an interactive screen, allowing visitors to reach out and ’touch’ them.

Orbi Dubai also has its own gift shop, which sells a range of realistic soft toys and other Orbi merchandise.

Location.
The Orbi Dubai attraction is located in Dubai’s City Centre Mirdif, a retail complex which is owned and operated by Majid Al Futtaim Leisure and Entertainment. The Mirdif shopping mall is close to the central Mushrif Park and is also home to more than 430 retail units and a variety of other entertainment and theatre attractions.

Whilst there are no age restrictions on entrance to Orbi Dubai, children aged under four are not permitted to enter the Frozen: Mount Kenya attraction for health and safety reasons. All under-12s entering Orbi Dubai must be accompanied at all times by a guardian aged 16 or over.

It is located in the city centre, on Via Giovanni Battista Viotti, near <a href="Piazza%20Castello%2C%20Turin">Piazza Castello</a>.

Torre Littoria was built in 1933-34, with the intent of hosting, among other offices, the national headquarters of the <a href="National%20Fascist%20Party">National Fascist Party</a>; in fact it never did, with the party's headquarters located first in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and then in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Instead it became wholly owned by "Reale Mutua Assicurazioni" (Royal Mutual Association), an insurance company that already financed almost all of its costs and is still the owner of the entire property.

The building is a prominent example of <a href="Rationalism%20%28architecture%29%23Early%2020th-century%20rationalism">early 20th-century Italian rationalist architecture</a>, notable for its widespread use of innovative materials such as <a href="glass%20brick">glass brick</a>, <a href="clinker%20brick">clinker brick</a> and <a href="linoleum">linoleum</a>, and is also the first Italian building with a welded metal <a href="structural%20system">structural frame</a>.

The building occupies a little more than two-thirds of a city block, consisting of a 9-storey low-rise section, and a 19-storey high-rise section reaching 87 metres at its roof, upon which rises an antenna tower, giving the building a total height of 109 metres; until 1940 it was the tallest continuously habitable building in Italy.

The height of the building, in proximity to the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Turin">Royal Palace of Turin</a>, was regarded as a statement of Fascist dominance over the Italian Royal <a href="House%20of%20Savoy">House of Savoy</a>, and over the years the building has been derided as "an <a href="eyesore">eyesore</a>", "the finger of <a href="Duce">Duce</a>", "the <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a>" and "the arrogant tower".

History.
Opening of Centre (2003).
Kellyville Village was opened in 2003 and was originally named Kellyville Plaza. It was built to meet the demands of a growing Kellyville during a population boom in the area. The centre contained a smaller Coles store and 22 specialty stores. In the same year, a <a href="Woolworths%20Supermarkets">Woolworths</a> supermarket opened on the land next door, and an access ramp was constructed to link both sides of the commercial area. 

Centre Redevelopment (2015).
Kellyville Plaza was extended in 2015, with a larger Coles store and more specialty stores built over what was vacant land adjacent to the centre. The centre was renamed Kellyville Village upon completion of the extension.

Coles Megastore.
With the centre redevelopment in 2015, the Coles store was expanded to offer facilities including a delicatessen, butcher, bakery, larger produce area and more aisles. This replaced the old supermarket, which contained dated interiors and a more compact layout.

First Choice Liquor.
The new First Choice Liquor store opened in early 2016 in part of the original carpark. The store offered a wider range of liquor items than competing stores in Kellyville, but has been locally criticised due to it being separated from the rest of the centre.

Krake ZK 14

Krake was a Dutch <a href="sailing%20ship">sailing ship</a> with the identifier ZK 14. It was bought by the <a href="German%20people">German</a> progressive <a href="Pedagogy">pedagogue</a>, <a href="bard">bard</a> and <a href="writer">writer</a> <a href="Martin%20Luserke">Martin Luserke</a>. The former fishery vessel was deployed as his swimming poet's workshop. It cruised the shallow coastal regions of <a href="The%20Netherlands">The Netherlands</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, Southern <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and Southern <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> as well as channels and rivers between <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. In harbours it was visited by a larger quantity of mostly younger people who attended readings and taletelling. "Krake" became very well-known during 1934 and 1938 and still is a topic in German literature, scientific literature, local museums, libraries, archives, encyclopaedia and lectures. One of its later well-known visitors was <a href="Beate%20Uhse">Beate Uhse</a>.

Name.
Luserke named the ship "Krake" (= <a href="octopus">octopus</a>) since he found a lot of stone jars (in old German language called "Kruke") on it. Despite their completely different meaning both words sound similar which triggered the idea. Even his ship pet <a href="parakeet">parakeet</a>'s name was created this way. It was named "Kraki" which is a belittlement of "Krake", but was then modified to "Karaki".

History.
"Ebenhaëzer" ZK 14 (ex ZK 74).
The Dutch fishery vessel "Ebenhaëzer" with the identifier ZK 14 (ex ZK 74) was formerly owned by Betto and Maarten Bolt of <a href="Zoutkamp">Zoutkamp</a>, The Netherlands. The ship's name referred to <a href="Eben-Ezer">Eben-Ezer</a> (<a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>: אבן העזר‎, "Even HaʿEzer", lit. "stone of help"), a place where <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> (Hebrew: בני ישראל‎‎ "Bnei Yisra'el") fought against the <a href="Philistines">Philistines</a> (Hebrew: פְּלִשְׁתִּים‎, "Plištim"). Between 1911 and 1934 the open "Blazer" was deployed to <a href="Trawling">trawl</a> fish, especially <a href="mussels">mussels</a>, <a href="plaice">plaice</a>, <a href="prawn">prawn</a> and some <a href="herring">herring</a>. The ship probably originates from the second half of the 19th century but its early history is not documented in its port of registry or home port. When Luserke bought the ship on 25 February 1934 it was reportedly overlain for a longer time. So despite its construction of solid <a href="oak">oak</a> the ship was unkempt and already in a rather shabby condition. On its four-day-conversion tour to <a href="East%20Frisia">East Frisia</a> in Northern Germany the <a href="Cabin%20%28ship%29">cabin</a> <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">under deck</a> broke down.

"Krake" ZK 14.
On wharf in Oldersum, East Frisia, the ship was completely restored, renovated and newly developed with superstructures like a wheel house and an elevated cabin roof on its foredeck to gain a bit more headroom for its crew and guests under deck. The vessel also got a new 2-cylinder <a href="Deutz%20AG">Deutz</a> engine. The ship's identifier "ZK 14" was inherited on its <a href="Gaff%20rig">gaff</a> sail whereas the identification on both sides of its <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> was overwritten by its new name "Krake". The vessel partially became a white paint coating but its flat floor plate was painted in black. Any metal panelling was silvery.

On Sunday, 15 July 1934, the ship was ready for the <a href="maiden%20voyage">maiden voyage</a> with its all-new engine. Martin Luserke and his fifteen-year-old son Dieter (1918–2005) boarded in Oldersum and went back to their home on the island <a href="Juist">Juist</a>, which is one of the <a href="sandbank">sandbank</a>s which delimit the <a href="Wadden%20Sea">Wadden Sea</a>. His son was already sailing since the age of six so he owned some basic skills.

Martin Luserke was dedicated to the fine arts but also possessed a hands-on mentality. In 1906 he was co-founder of "<a href="Freie%20Schulgemeinde%20Wickersdorf">Freie Schulgemeinde Wickersdorf</a>" (= Free School Community of Wickersdorf) in <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a> and in 1925 had founded "<a href="Schule%20am%20Meer">Schule am Meer</a>" (= School by the Sea) on Juist Island. In the latter his motto was "education by sea". He enabled his pupils to learn about <a href="sailing">sailing</a> with the school's own <a href="sail%20boat">sail boat</a>s (<a href="dinghy%20cruiser">dinghy cruiser</a>s) or to signalise using the <a href="International%20maritime%20signal%20flags">flag alphabet</a>. One of his educational goals was to form his pupils' attitude, an earthiness, comradeship and their sense of team responsibility, leading to an autonomous personality. The latter turned out to be incompatible with <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>. 

In spring 1934 Luserke's school had to close against the background of "<a href="Gleichschaltung">Gleichschaltung</a>" (= Nazification) and <a href="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a> so he asked his son if he wanted to follow him at sea. His wife Annemarie (1878–1926) had died early. As an answer he got an immediate yes from the sail enthusiast. With a talented teacher as father his son Dieter felt he could easily quit school.

As a professional preparation his son went aboard the 100-ton-sailship "Ostfriesland" (= East Frisia) which anchored near Juist at that time. There he hoped to learn the necessary until midth of June 1934. In 1931 his father had already completed a <a href="Mate%20%28naval%20officer%29">mate's</a> certificate in <a href="Leer">Leer</a>, East Frisia. Until August 1934 father and son both used Juist as their <a href="home%20port">home port</a> whilst school matters had to be cleared. Later their trips with "Krake" went from the Dutch <a href="West%20Frisian%20Islands">West Frisian Islands</a> along the German <a href="East%20Frisian%20Islands">East Frisian Islands</a> and <a href="North%20Frisian%20Islands">North Frisian Islands</a> to Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the German islands in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> like <a href="Fehmarn">Fehmarn</a>, <a href="Hiddensee">Hiddensee</a> and <a href="R%C3%BCgen">Rügen</a>, through Dutch, German and Danish channels, rivers and lakes like "<a href="Lake%20Schwerin">Lake Schwerin</a>" where they also hibernated.

"Krake" became well-known in the harbours since the ship was neither used for commercial fishery nor for cargo which was rather uncommon at that time of economic uncertainty. Especially younger people felt attracted to the readings and taletelling aboard "Krake". Luserke's stories got formed with each taletelling and were finally written down. Prior he always checked out his listener's reactions. He had a typewriter and a small book inventory aboard. Even the press got interested when in 1935 an <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n press photographer came aboard for a home story.

Another reason for the ship's reputation depicted an unusual decoration of its inner cabin walls. <a href="Harbourmaster">Harbourmaster</a>s and <a href="Customs%20officer">Customs officer</a>s who had to inspect the ship worked up curiosity for those strange figurative to symbolical <a href="carving">carving</a>s. Luserke created them during his time as <a href="POW">POW</a> in France between 1917 and 1918. They added to the theatrical effects of Luserke's taletelling and readings in a similar way than harsh weather conditions or the pounding of the waves against the ship's body. Luserke's use of ancient <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse</a> and <a href="Brittany">Breton</a> myths and legends as well as dramatic ghost and <a href="Klabautermann">Klabautermann</a> stories from the coast provoked a certain thrill. The prestigious writer <a href="Carl%20Zuckmayer">Carl Zuckmayer</a> who felt an antipathy for him, regarded Luserke as "of extensive phantasy, originality, capability at the highest stage" with a tremendous talent "of artistics, especially theatric".

His former pupils from Thuringia and Juist Island as well as teacher colleagues came aboard but also unknown guests like hitchhikers who attended the ship for free trips. Luserke integrated them in the daily work aboard which revealed his pedagogic background. One of his guests aboard who later became well-known was <a href="Beate%20Uhse">Beate Uhse</a>. In her memoirs she wrote about Luserke as her most favourite teacher characterizing him as "appreciative", "generous" and "full of wit". She became one of the first lady-pilots to test new planes.

The city of <a href="Emden">Emden</a> fascinated Luserke, so there he rented a flat for himself and his son to hibernate. He explored the city's library and archive for his historical research. In Emden and its "Falderndelft" harbour several of Luserkes books were created which became bestsellers during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1935 Luserke was awarded with "Literaturpreis der Reichshauptstadt Berlin" for his novel "<a href="Hasko%20%28novel%29">Hasko</a>" which reflects two historic sea battles of the Dutch <a href="Watergeuzen">Watergeuzen</a> near <a href="Ameland">Ameland Island</a> and Emden.

Luserke developed a very special relation to his fictional book "Obadjah and the ZK 14" which incorporates his ship and those many empty stone jars originally meant for hard liquor which he had found aboard. Despite the Antisemitism of that time the name of his character "Obadjah" (Hebrew עובדיה) as fictional former <a href="ship-owner">ship-owner</a> originates from the major-domo of Jewish king <a href="Ahab">Ahab</a>.

Weiselberg

The Weiselberg is a high hill in the <a href="North%20Palatine%20Uplands">North Palatine Uplands</a> near <a href="Oberkirchen%20%28Freisen%29">Oberkirchen</a> in the <a href="Saarland">Saarland</a> <a href="Landkreis%20St.%20Wendel">county of St. Wendel</a>.

The Weiselberg is covered in forest, especially on its upper slopes and is a habitat for rare species of plant. It was made a nature reserve in 1950.

Geography.
Location.
The Weiselberg is located in the southeastern part of the <a href="Saar-Hunsr%C3%BCck%20Nature%20Park">Saar-Hunsrück Nature Park</a> immediately west of the village of Oberkirchen through which flows the <a href="Blies">Blies</a> tributary of the <a href="Oster%20%28Blies%29">Oster</a> which rises on the north-northwest of the hill. Oberkirchen itself is in the municipality of <a href="Freisen">Freisen</a>. To the west-northwest rises the Leichweilerbach, a left-hand headstream of the "Betzelbach". To the south is the "Weiseler Born", the source of the Oster tributary, the "Wilmesbach". The northern <a href="hill%20spur">hill spur</a> of the Weiselberg is the roughly -high Mittelberg, whose terrain transitions into the hill of Hochrech.

Natural regions.
The Weiselberg lies in the <a href="natural%20region">natural region</a>al major unit group of the <a href="Saar-Nahe%20Uplands">Saar-Nahe Uplands</a> (No. 19) on the boundary of the major units of the <a href="North%20Palatine%20Uplands">North Palatine Uplands</a> (Glan-Alsenz Uplands and Hill Country, "Glan-Alsenz-Berg- und Hügelland"; 193) with its sub-unit, the Kusel Upland ("Kuseler Bergland", 193.3) in the east and the Prims-Nahe Upland ("Prims-Nahe-Bergland") (Upper Nahe Hills "Oberes Nahebergland"; 194) with its sub-unit, the Hirstein Upland ("Hirsteiner Bergland", 194.2) in the west.

Geology.
Geologically, the Weiselberg belongs to the <a href="North%20Palatine%20Uplands">North Palatine Uplands</a>. Its summit dome consists of volcanic rock (<a href="vulcanite">vulcanite</a>) of the <a href="Permian">Permian</a> ("<a href="Rotliegendes">Rotliegendes</a>"), about 280 million years old.

A vulcanite is formed, when <a href="magma">magma</a> rises through the <a href="earth%27s%20crust">earth's crust</a> and breaks out onto the surface of the earth. As it is weathered the soft rock surrounding it is eroded and the hard volcanic rock is left behind.

The hill is made of rock typical of its kind and which is named after it: <a href="weiselbergite">weiselbergite</a> (<a href="type%20locality">type locality</a>), which was first described in 1887 by <a href="Karl%20Heinrich%20Rosenbusch">Karl Heinrich Rosenbusch</a>. It is a deep black and light blue magmatic rock with isolated pieces of <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a> which give the appearance of the sky at night. According to Tröger it is a <a href="dacitic">dacitic</a> vulcanite with about 66 % glass content. <a href="Agate">Agate</a>s are found within the rock. As early as <a href="Roman%20times">Roman times</a> agate was being excavated on the surface of the hill. From the 15th century, during an agate boom period, the green rock was mined using <a href="adit">adit</a>s.

The Weiselberg is a magmatic <a href="volcanic%20plug">volcanic plug</a>. Its most striking <a href="rock%20formation">rock formation</a> is the "Steinerne Schrank" ("Stone Cupboard"), a wide rock face which looks like a large cupboard.

On the southern slopes of the Weiselberg lies a <a href="basaltic">basaltic</a> <a href="blockfield">blockfield</a>, the "Steinernes Meer" ("Rocky Sea"). Originally, magma rose from the earth's interior. It gradually solidified under the earth's surface to form mostly pentagonal column formations, which is typical of slowly cooling basalt. Their shape was caused during cooling by shrinkage of the magma, similar to cracks in the drying mud of a puddle. Over a period of millions of years, the surrounding softer rock was eroded. The blockfield visible today was formed during the <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a> around 10,000 years ago by <a href="solifluction">solifluction</a> of the weathered rock columns.

1982 mapping showed that the rock columns in the area of the summit dome have a so-called "Meilerstellung" ("milling position"). This is usually caused by the fact that a lava lake in the crater of a volcano solidifies relatively quickly. The high glass content in the rock also indicates that the original magma was very near to the surface and cooled fast. The columns then formed perpendicular to the crater walls.

Protected areas.
The majority of the Weiselberg is protected by the "Weisselberg" <a href="Nature%20reserve%20%28Germany%29">Nature Reserve</a> (<a href="Common%20Database%20on%20Designated%20Areas">CDDA</a> No. 82884; established in 1950; 74.2 <a href="Hektar">ha</a> in area), the "Weisselberg" <a href="Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation">Special Area of Conservation</a> (FFH No. 6409-305; 78 ha) and the "Weisselberg" <a href="bird%20reserve">bird reserve</a> (VSG No. 6409-305; 78 ha). On the hill are parts of the <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a> of the County of St. Wendel and Municipality of Freisen (CDDA No. 390232; 1976; 11.4797 <a href="Quadratkilometer">km²</a>).

This inaugural contest will consist of only one show, and is yet to be scheduled although is expected to take place sometime in 2018.

Background.
In March 2016, it was announced that a deal had been signed between the <a href="European%20Broadcasting%20Union">European Broadcasting Union</a> (EBU) and the Australian broadcaster <a href="Special%20Broadcasting%20Service">Special Broadcasting Service</a> (SBS), which gave the channel the rights to create a version of the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> for countries in Asia to be able to compete in a contest similar to the European version. The rules and format for the new contest are in the development stages between SBS and their production partner <a href="Blink%20TV">Blink TV</a>. The inaugural contest, which had yet to be given a name, was be held in Australia in 2017.

Further information was later released in May 2016 regarding the eligibility for the contest, which could see up to sixty-eight countries compete in the contest. In July 2016 it was announced that four countries had either confirmed or expressed their interest in the inaugural contest, which has been given a preliminary name of "Eurovision Asia Song Contest", including then host nation Australia, China, Japan, and South Korea.

This is the latest event to be launched by the EBU since the <a href="Eurovision%20Choir%20of%20the%20Year">Eurovision Choir of the Year</a> in . 

Format and concept.
After the idea had already been adopted in March 2016, the competition was officially confirmed on 18 August 2017. The format will closely resemble that of the Eurovision Song Contest. The only difference is that there should be only a live final, instead of including two semi-finals, with up to 20 countries taking part.

Participation.
The following countries have expressed their provisional interest in participating in the contest:

Hosting.
Most of the expense of the contest is covered by <a href="Sponsor%20%28commercial%29">commercial sponsors</a> and contributions from the other participating nations. The contest is considered to be a unique opportunity for promoting the host country as a tourist destination. The table below shows a list of cities and venues that have hosted the Eurovision Asia Song Contest, one or more times. Future venues are shown in "italics".

Edith Mary Gell

Edith Mary Gell (1860-1944) [also known as 'Edith Lyttleton Gell' and 'Edith Brodrick Gell'] was a Victorian writer and Christian activist. Born in 1860, she was the fourth daughter of of <a href="William%20Brodrick%2C%208th%20Viscount%20Midleton">William Brodrick, 8th Viscount Midleton</a> and Augusta, daughter of <a href="Thomas%20Fremantle%2C%201st%20Baron%20Cottesloe">1st Baron Cottesloe</a>. She was the sister of <a href="St%20John%20Brodrick%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Midleton">William St John Fremantle Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton</a> (1856-1942), a distinguished politician who was Secretary of State for War from 1900-1903 and Secretary of State for India from 1903-1905. She married Philip Lyttleton Gell (1852-1926) on 25th July 1889. The marriage was without offspring. She died on 17th April 1944.
Reputation.
Hazel Southam in an online article entitled, "Socks, Hoodies and Bible verses at real-life Downton Abbey" has compared Edith's activities with those of characters in the television series <a href="Downton%20Abbey">Downton Abbey</a>. Edith was very active in the local community and supported local families through <a href="Mothers%27%20Union">Mothers' Union</a>. She also ran "a Sunday morning children’s service until shortly before her death in 1944". <br>
Edith is described in the <a href="The%20National%20Archives%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Archive</a> entry for <a href="Hopton%20Hall">Hopton Hall</a> as follows:
<br>"An indefatigable writer of devotional poems, hymns, and moralistic pageants and tracts, Edith Lyttelton Gell strongly supported traditional family values. She was prominent in organisations such as the Mothers' Union, the Central Church Union and the Union of Women Workers. Derbyshire church matters were another interest and she involved herself in both Carsington and Wirksworth parishes. Deeply conventional in outlook, Edith Lyttelton Gell for many years published or circulated her writings amongst her extended family and social circle. She reached a wider readership with her memoirs, 'Under Three Reigns'."

Connections.
Being of the aristocracy, Edith Gell was well connected and she gives an entertaining account of the people she knew in her autobiography: "Under Three Reigns". When she was married, she was presented to <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and describes her experience at court as follows:<br>
“The actual entry into the Throne Room was really dignified. Each lady as she entered the communicating broad corridor had her train spread out in all its glory. On your left was a great mirror which contributed to an appropriately stately carriage; the march had to be slow as the train in front occupied the ground. If you were a Peeress the Queen embraced you; if not, you kissed her hand, remembering to put your hand beneath her wrist so as to give the salute gracefully as you rose from your curtsey. If you were adroit, you got in three more to the chief Royalties, and one to the lesser lights, before your beautiful train was unceremoniously bundled over your arm by an usher, and you went out at the other end of the Presence Chamber backwards."<br>
She and her husband were friends of the poet <a href="Alfred%20Tennyson">Alfred Tennyson</a> and she gives us the following account of him:<br>
"The poet Tennyson was a far-off neighbour, and came over occasionally to Garden Parties. He abhorred being lionised, and made a point of emitting the most commonplace remarks to fend off the gush he detested. In the tea-room he turned to my Mother, ham sandwich in hand, and [p.90] electrified her by inquiring: ”How do you cure your ham?” She replied that it was doubtless salted in the usual way. “Oh! but that is all wrong”, he exclaimed; “it should be soaked in treacle and then smoked”, adding mischievously as he saw her astonishment: “This is like eating my old boots!”<br>
"He had been so pestered that he found the only method of defence was an abruptness bordering on brutality. Yet in his own home he was a different creature. Lady Tennyson was a relation of my husband’s, and after our marriage we visited them both at Farringford and at Aldworth. He had his moods, of course, like all men of genius, but once you were inside his guard all was well."

Levallois-Perret attack

On the morning of 9 August 2017, a car rammed into a group of soldiers in the <a href="Levallois-Perret">Levallois-Perret</a> <a href="commune">commune</a> in the northwestern suburbs of <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. Six soldiers patrolling the area as part of <a href="Op%C3%A9ration%20Sentinelle">Opération Sentinelle</a> were injured in the attack, three of them seriously. The driver fled the scene and was arrested on a highway between Boulogne and Calais, a couple of hours later. According to the French police the incident was terrorist-related.

Context.
The attack is part of a series of terrorist attacks in France since November 2015, about half of which have targeted police of the military patrols that appeared in the streets of France with the imposition of the <a href="States%20of%20emergency%20in%20France">State of Emergency</a> that has been in continuous effect since the <a href="November%202015%20Paris%20attacks">November 2015 Paris attacks</a>.

Attack.
On the morning of 9 August 2017 at around 08:00, a car that had been "visibly pre-positioned" rammed into a group of a dozen soldiers as they left their barracks in the morning. The driver behind the wheel of a dark-colored BMW, was waiting in "ambush" in an alley from which he could see the soldiers emerge and begin to walk towards their patrol vehicles to start their morning's work. a The group, members of the <a href="35th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28France%29">35th regiment of infantry</a> stationed in <a href="Belfort">Belfort</a> who were taking part in <a href="Op%C3%A9ration%20Sentinelle">Opération Sentinelle</a>. According to Interior Minister Gérard Collomb, the car approached slowly, then sped up to deliberately target the soldiers. At least six were injured, three of them seriously. The car then fled the scene while the remaining soldiers tried to give chase. The attack was described as 'deliberate' by French police as the car was waiting for the soldiers to arrive at the spot the driver intended to attack.

Four of the victims were transported to the <a href="B%C3%A9gin%20Military%20Teaching%20Hospital">Bégin Military Teaching Hospital</a> in Saint-Mandé and the two more severely wounded soldiers were transported to the <a href="H%C3%B4pital%20d%27instruction%20des%20arm%C3%A9es%20Percy">Hôpital d'instruction des armées Percy</a> in Clamart, and their vital prognosis was not committed.

<doc id="54825133" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54825133" title="Grillo-class tracked torpedo motorboat">
Grillo-class tracked torpedo motorboat

The "Grillo"-class was a <a href="ship%20class">class</a> of <a href="Torpedo%20boat">torpedo armed motorboat</a>s in service with the "<a href="Regia%20Marina">Regia Marina</a>" (the Royal Navy of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a>) during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. The notable feature of these vessels was that each was equipped with a pair of spiked <a href="continuous%20track">continuous track</a>s, intended to allow them to climb over <a href="Boom%20%28navigational%20barrier%29">harbour boom</a>s and attack enemy shipping at anchor. In 1918, two attempts to use them to penetrate <a href="Austro-Hungarian">Austro-Hungarian</a> harbour defences both ended in failure. 

Development.
The <a href="Blockade%20of%20Germany">Allied Naval Blockade</a> had confined the <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> to the waters close to their principle <a href="naval%20base">naval base</a>s in the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>. Wishing to avoid risking the numerically superior Italian battle fleet in an engagement in the confined coastal waters of the Adriatic, where the Austrians might achieve a local advantage close to their heavily fortified coasts and islands, the "Regia Marina" chose instead to conduct a "little war" using fast torpedo motorboats, "<a href="MAS%20%28motorboat%29">Motoscafo armato silurante</a>" or MAS.

A successful attack by MAS torpedo boats on the Austrian base at <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> on 9 December 1917, led to the requirement for a specialised version able to cross the more substantial harbour boom at the main Austrian base at Pola (present-day <a href="Pula">Pula</a> in <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>). Designed by engineer Attilio Bisio at the SVAN boatyard, the solution was a 16 metre shallow-draught motorboat with a tracks mounted on <a href="rhomboid">rhomboid</a>al rails on each side, reminiscent of the arrangement on a <a href="British%20heavy%20tanks%20of%20World%20War%20I">British heavy tank</a>. These tracks were driven by two 5 horse-power <a href="electric%20motor">electric motor</a>s to ensure a silent approach and the links were fitted with hooked spikes, intended to grip the large timber baulks from which the cables and nets of the boom were suspended, enabling the vessel to simply crawl over the top of them. Armament consisted of two lightweight <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es mounted on either side of the boat on "drop collars".

Originally designated "Barchino Saltatore" ("Jumping Boats"), four examples were built and were all commissioned in March 1918, named after various jumping insects. 

Service.
The first attack by these vessels was on 13 April 1918. Two boats, "Cavalletta" and "Pulce" were towed into position outside the harbour, but the length of time required by the slow electric motors had been misjudged and neither vessel had reached the boom by daybreak, forcing their crews to scuttle the craft rather than let them be captured. On the night of 13 May 1918, "Grillo" attempted to enter the harbour, however the loud clattering noise made by the tracks while crossing the wooden beams alerted the defenders. "Grillo" had crossed four of the five booms before coming under heavy <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a> fire, and she either sank or was scuttled. The Austrians later recovered the wreck and had begun work on a two copies when the war ended.

Emma Stirling

Emma Stirling (1839 - 1907) was a <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> activist in child welfare and in arranging their emigration to Canada. She created the organisation that became the <a href="Children%201st">Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (a.k.a. Children 1st)</a>, but her contribution was not acknowledged in their history.

Life.
Stirling was born in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> to a rich family and she was brought up in <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a>. Her family had both Scottish and American roots and they would spend the winters in England. Stirling became involved in her teens with the local school where she progressed from helper to secretary.

In 1877 she moved to Edinburgh financed by a substantial inheritance. In Edinburgh she established and subsidised a nursery for working mothers. She took on a board of directors and the Stirling Homes became the <a href="Edinburgh%20and%20Leith%20Children%27s%20Aid%20and%20Refuge%20Society">Edinburgh and Leith Children's Aid and Refuge Society</a>. Stirling also opened the first home for abused children in Edinburgh in 1884. Under the patronage of the <a href="John%20Hamilton-Gordon%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Aberdeen%20and%20Temair">John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair</a> her organisation grew to eight homes that housed 300 children. This organisation grew into the <a href="Children%201st">Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</a>, although Stirling resigned in 1877.

Canada.
In 1882 Stirling visited Canada and reported at being disappointed at the lack of respect given to child emigrants from Britain. However she believed that child emigration could be beneficial and she established her own organisation at <a href="Aylesford%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Aylesford, Nova Scotia</a>. Stirling's work was confused by legal disputes concerning children who were sent to Canada and later their parents objected. In one case the child was returned but Stirling refused to let the child return to her alcoholic parents. Eventually the courts agreed and this has been seen as important case-law as the child's needs were placed above the parents requests. In another case there were long proceedings against Stirling for the return of a man's family. They had been placed into the care of the Edinburgh and Leith Children's Aid and Refuge Society and Stirling had later later arranged their emigration. Stirling at first claimed that they had been placed with good families, but it later became obvious that she did no know where they were. Stirling agreed to pay the legal costs on the condition that her name appeared on the title page of the Scottish society.

Abortion, arson and USA.
Stirling moved to the USA after her farm was burnt to the ground in 1895. She and local newspapers believed this was arson. Stirling had caused controversy when she had a local man and doctor charged with performing an illegal abortion. The abortion was performed on Grace Fagan who was a former emigrant who had become pregnant by the man who had agreed to look after her. Stirling was annoyed at the lack of support and she decided to devote herself to animal rights and died in <a href="Coatesville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Coatesville</a> in Pennsylvania in 1907. She left her wealth to charities and friends.

Sharaf-ud-Din Abdul Rehman Bulbul Shah

Life.
Hazrat Sharaf-ud-Din Abdul Rehman Bulbul Shah born in <a href="Turkistan">Turkistan</a> and later on visited Kashmir and laid foundation of <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> and secular culture of Kashmir in the year 1320 A.D. historians, scholars and intellectuals are of the opinion that like other great civilizations of the world.As regards his place of birth, the recordsgive conflicting views, some mentioning <a href="Turkistan">Turkistan</a>, while otherssuggesting Iran and <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>. His family claimed direct descent from the <a href="Prophet%20Muhammad">Prophet Muhammad</a> and was well known for its piety. Hazrat BulbulShah is believed to have spent many years in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, where he became a disciple of the noted <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> of the <a href="Suhrawardi">Suhrawardi</a> order, Hazrat Shah Nimatullah Wali Farsi, who, in turn, according to one source, was a disciple of <a href="Hazrat%20Ziauddin-ul%20Najib%20Abdul%20Qahiri">Hazrat Ziauddin-ul Najib Abdul Qahiri</a>. The origin of Sufi civilization of Kashmir worldwide known as Kashmiriyat lies in the philosophy of brotherhood and mutual love respectability as propagated by Bulbul Shah commonly known as Amir-i-Kashmir and Baadashah-i-Kashmir. born in Turkistan and later on visited Kashmir where he permanently stayed till his death is subject to various scholarly opinions. However, it is clear that like other great Sufi saints of Kashmir his grave and shrine is present in the Valley.
During the time of Bulbul Shah three distinguished religions Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam had impact in Asia. particularly Prince of Kashgar and Ladakh <a href="Rinchana">Rinchana</a> Shah who is known as Renzu Shah as per history written by Khawja Dedmari,

On his first visit to Kashmir, he is believed to have laid a mystical foundation stone of SUFISM in Kashmir. His Second visit to Kashmir in 1320 AD effected into the conversion of Rainchan Shah – a <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> Prince to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> who was named as Sultan Sadrudin who made the First <a href="mosque">mosque</a> in Kashmir.

He was instrumental in making the conversion of the ruler of Kashmir <a href="Rinchana">Rinchana</a> (1320–1323) to Islam and this important conversion of a ruler was very significant.The title symbolizing Kashmiriyat was given to other great leaders of Kashmir as a symbol of being protector of people. Impressed by bravery and people friendly approach of <a href="Rinchana">Rinchana</a>, love and peace during period of Bulbul Shah and Renzu Shah who assumed the name of Sultan Sadar-ud-Din. His son Khawja Hyder instead of Kingship preferred Sufi way of life. In order to show reverence to the memory of Bulbul Shah, <a href="Rinchana">Rinchana</a> (Sadr-U-Din) constructed a <a href="Khanaqah">Khanaqah</a> after his name, which is known as the first <a href="Khanqah">Khanqah</a> and which became so famous that the mohalla (locality), where it existed became to be known as Bulbul Lankar. The circumstances which motivated <a href="Rinchana">Rinchana</a> to accept <a href="Islam">Islam</a> seem to have been the impression created on him by the simplicity and purity of Bulbul Shah in comparison to the ostentatious and impure life of his own people around him. After accepting <a href="Islam">Islam</a> as his religion, he assumed the name of Sultan Sadr-U-Din and at present attracts our attention for being the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir. After Rinchana’s conversion, under the influence of Bulbul Shah along with his his family brother-in-Law and Commander-in-Chie Ministers and majority of the subjects f and several other leading Kashmiris several other people of his Kingdom accepted the creed of Bulbul Shah. Rinchen's Following the conversion of Rinchen and his, also followed suit, most notably Rawanchandra, son of the Hindu king Ramachandra who had been deposed by Rinchen. Many low' castes and Buddhists, too, now began to embrace the new faith.seeing in it a source of liberation from the shackles of the <a href="Brahminical%20system">Brahminical system</a>. It is said that, in all, Hazrat Bulbul Shah succeeded in huge number of converts to Islam through means of peaceful missionary effort, although this figure seems considerablyexaggerated.

Hazrat Bulbul Shah took up residence on the banks of the Jhelum where Rinchen Shah set up a khanqah or Sufi centre at Ali Kadal in the heart of Srinagar. Close to the khanqah, on the advice of bulbul shah Rinchen Shah constructed two mosques, including a Jami'ah mosque for the Friday congregational prayers. Attached to the khanqah was a large langar khana or community kitchen, the poor were fed free of cost twice a day. The credit for introducing the institution of the langar in Kashmir, which is still to be found in several Sufi centres all over the region, thus goes to Hazrat Bulbul Shah. At the <a href="khanqah">khanqah</a> he would deliver regular sermons and provide spiritual instruction to his followers who, in turn, carried the message of Islam to various other parts of Kashmir.
Belief in the power of ghosts and evil spirits was particularly strong and widespread among the people. Hazrat Bulbul Shah, it is said, organized a special religious service at which he recited the Surat al-Jinn, a chapter of the Holy Qur'an, after which `he no longer heard complaints from the people about jinns troubling them'.[33] His close involvement with ordinary folk in their times of need is evident from the story that once, at the height of a particularly severe winter when all the lakes had turned to ice, the people of Srinagar, having no access to water, came to him for help. Hazrat Bulbul Shah, so the story goes, looked uptowards the sky and called out, `Where is the sun to melt all theice?' All at once, it is said, the sun appeared from behind a thickblanket of clouds and the ice on the lakes began to melt.[34] Althoughthis may well be a later hagiographic legend, the story clearlysuggests the understanding that ordinary Kashmiris have of the Sufi being deeply concerned about the plight of the poor.

Being a devout Muslim Sufi, Hazrat Bulbul Shah led `a life of complete self-abnegation' and `cast an enormous influence on the people amongst whom he worked and lived'. He preached against the popular superstitions that were widely prevalent amongst the Kashmiris of his day. Hazrat Bulbul Shah carried on with his mission of spreading Islam from his <a href="khanqah">khanqah</a> until he breathed his last in 1327 CE.
As per research conducted by scholars and historians Bulbul Shah was accompanied with other pious saints particularly Bulbul Kamal-ud-Din, whose grave is between Chakoti and Uri road, Bulbul Jalal-ud-Din whose grave is between Harwan Buddhist Monastery and Nishat Garden and Hazrat Kamal Sahib who was buried just out side the palace of King Renzu Shah. The Palace of King is presently constructed as college and new Women’s College building has been converted at the ancestral site, while as graves of both Bulbul Shah and Renzu Shah (Rinchana) are located at Bulbul Lankar Nawa Kadal, on the other side of the Palace. The Bulbul Shah’s shrine is first Muslim Sufi shrine of Kashmir which has its intellectual influence up to Kashgar.

historians believe that bulbul shah role was crucial in planting the seeds of Islam in the region. after his death several number of Sufi saints came to kashmir stayed at bubul shah's shrine and khanah for missionary work. Although the massconversion of the Kashmiris to Islam within a century.

Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes Wilderness Area

The Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes Wilderness Area is located in <a href="Halifax%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, Canada. Considered to be of high ecological value, it is one of 40 designated <a href="wilderness%20area">wilderness area</a>s in the province. 

The wilderness area would form the heart of the larger Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes Regional Park, which has been proposed by the city since 2006.

History.
The Metropolitan Area Planning Committee (MAPC), a former <a href="regional%20planning">regional planning</a> body, identified the area in the 1970s as having high conservation value.

Wilderness area designation.
In 2009, the province created the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes Wilderness Area out of 1,316 heatares of <a href="Crown%20land">Crown land</a>.

In 2015, the wilderness area was expanded from 1,316 to 1,767 hectares.

There is a linear corridor through the wilderness area that is not protected. This is the intended alignment of the proposed <a href="Nova%20Scotia%20Highway%20113">Highway 113</a>, a suburban freeway.

Regional park.
Conceptual plan.
In 2006, the Halifax Regional Municipality adopted a conceptual plan to turn the area into a regional park. The wilderness area, designated in 2009 from provincially-owned lands, would form the heart of this park. Major private landholders include Susie Lake Developments, The Stevens Group, and the Annapolis Group. The current municipal zoning does not permit development.

Development plan controversy.
The Annapolis Group brought forward plans for a low-density subdivision in the eastern area of the conceptual regional park, and proposed that the park be made smaller to accommodate the development. An independent facilitator, Heather Robertson, released a report supportive of the developer's plans.

The report was met by an "intense backlash" from the public. It was presented by Robertson at the Future Inns in <a href="Clayton%20Park%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Clayton Park</a> on 20 June 2016, where the mood was one of "great frustration and anger" and the public was not allowed to speak or ask questions. A report published by city staff on 31 August 2016 also disagreed with the report, and recommended that the lands not be developed. Regional council received more than 1,400 letters from the public, the vast majority supportive of the proposed park and critical of Robertson's report. On 6 September 2016, council voted 15-1 against allowing the development plans to proceed.

In January 2017, the Annapolis Group announced a lawsuit against the city. It claims the city "effectively expropriated" its land by rejecting the development plans and is seeking $119 million in damages as "fair compensation".

Commonitorium (Orientius)

The Commonitorium () is the name of an <a href="elegiac">elegiac</a> poem by the Christian Latin poet <a href="Orientius">Orientius</a>, written sometime in the 5th century. Composed of 1036 verses and divided into two books, the poem describes the way to heaven, with warnings against its hindrances.

Contents and style.
The "Commonitorium" is a Latin elegiac poem written in couplets that focuses mostly on morality and theology. The work is didactic, and aims to teach one how to attain eternal salvation, all the while warning the reader of the <a href="seven%20deadly%20sins">seven deadly sins</a>. To further emphasize his point, Orientius discusses punishments that are awaiting in Hell, as well as the <a href="Last%20Judgement">Last Judgement</a>. And although the purpose of the poem is to instruct the reader in the proper way to live, the Latinist Johannes Schwind notes that the work is interjected with "occasional elements of diatribe and satire." In terms of style, the poet emulates the Christian poets <a href="Coelius%20Sedulius">Coelius Sedulius</a> (fl. early 5th century AD) and possibly <a href="Prudentius">Prudentius</a> (fl. late 4th century AD). The poem also quotes the Republican poet <a href="Catullus">Catullus</a>, and the Imperial poets <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> and <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>.

Textual history.

Delete (Story Untold song)

"Delete" is the first single off of Story Untold's upcoming debut album as Story Untold rather than Amasic. On the new song, lead vocalist Janick Thibault states, "Delete is a song that means a lot to me. It's about not wanting to let go of a relationship. Every time you try to do it, you're reminded of the good times. It's like you're stuck in the past but at the same time you know that things will never be the same again. I think many of us can relate to this song because it's always hard to convince yourself that some things are meant to be let go." The song was first played live during a Facebook live stream.

Contemporary Learning Spaces

Contemporary learning spaces offer flexible classrooms that allow learners to work in comfortable spaces with mobile technology. These contemporary learning spaces have two learning environments, the virtual learning space and the physical learning space. These learning areas are very different to traditional classrooms. 

They offer multipurpose spaces and technology accessibility. Furnishings and spaces are functional and varied catering for differing learning styles.These learning spaces are flexible encouraging team work and collaborative learning but also offer independent learning spaces for solo thinkers. 

They may be indoor areas or outdoors spaces. The furnishings may include lounges, recliners, tables of various shapes and sizes including bench like with stools and upright tables for learners who have a preference to stand as they work or study. 

 Teaching in such an environment allows the teacher to be a facilitator of learning allowing the students to develop 21 century skills such as being self-motivated, designing their study path, being critical thinkers, creative and inventive. 

These spaces allow learners to be global citizens and work creatively in environments which allow them to create their learning with technology and multimedia. 

The learners experience the world outside the classroom with the technology offered in these contemporary spaces and their own mobile technology, for example, communicating globally with SMS text messages and online learning tasks.The learners debate topics, research topics and share opinions with people from other areas of the country or from around the globe.The aim of contemporary learning spaces is to enable contemporary teaching and learning.

Frank Nuttall

Frank Nuttall (born 4 May 1969 in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Scotland">Hamilton, Scotland</a>) is a <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> professional football manager. 

Playing career.
Nuttall was an apprentice at <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> in his playing days. After two years, he was released in 1987 and found himself without club. He decided to study physical education at <a href="Cardiff%20Metropolitan%20University">Cardiff Metropolitan University</a> and went to <a href="Loughborough%20University">Loughborough University</a> to get a master's degree in sports science.

Coaching career.
At age 24, he began his coach education with the <a href="Football%20Association%20of%20Wales">Welsh FA</a> and working with their Under-14 and Under-15 sides. 
In 1998, he became fitness coach of <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion F.C.</a>. Nuttall never envisioned a career as a long-term fitness coach since he wanted to make a return to playing football. However, he could not return as a player so he decided to pursue a managing career by getting a <a href="UEFA%20A%20License">'A' License</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Pro%20License">Pro License</a>.

<a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers F.C.</a> appointed him as fitness coach in 2004. He was part of their backroom staff when they won the <a href="Scottish%20Premier%20League">league</a> in <a href="2004-05%20Scottish%20Premier%20League">2004-05</a>. 
Later, he was assistant manager of <a href="Al-Nasr%20Dubai%20SC">Al-Nasr Dubai SC</a> but he was unable to settle in his new job and his family could not come so he left after a period of time. Soon after, he did some scouting for <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>. and joined their backroom staff as fitness coach in 2008. 
Some years later, he worked in <a href="China">China</a> as a coach for the <a href="China%20national%20football%20team">national team</a> and clubs there. 

Africa.
Looking for a club in 2014, he eventually joined <a href="Gor%20Mahia">Gor Mahia</a>, champions of the <a href="Kenyan%20Premier%20League">Kenyan Premier League</a>; it would be the first time he would serve as a head coach. 
Seemingly, he became the highest-paid coach in the <a href="Kenyan%20Premier%20League">Kenyan Premier League</a> as he was paid over 600000 <a href="Kenyan%20shillings">Kenyan shillings</a> a month. Under his stewardship, he led the "K'Ogalo" to an unbeaten league title in 2015, an achievement unprecedented in the <a href="Kenyan%20Premier%20League">competition</a> since 1976. Adding to this, Nuttall guided them to <a href="KPL%20Top%208%20Cup">KPL Top 8 Cup</a> and <a href="Kenyan%20Super%20Cup">Kenyan Super Cup</a> titles in 2015 besides winning the league in 2014 and 2015. As a result of his efforts, Nuttall was named 2015 SportPesa Coach of the Year. 
When he was with <a href="Gor%20Mahia">Gor Mahia</a>, he denied rumors that he was intent on leaving <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>'s most profitable club in late 2015. A website ostensibly stated that Nuttall wanted a 10% salary increment as well. 
However, he had a cold relationship with the <a href="Gor%20Mahia">Gor Mahia</a> president and board since the president requested that his salary be reduced by 50%. Owing to tremendous fan pressure, he was reinstated as manager temporarily but Gor Mahia went five games without a victory under him at the start of the <a href="2016%20Kenyan%20Premier%20League">2016 season</a>. 
Due to the salary dispute, he was officially fired from the club in early 2016. A few days later, he was offered a three-room apartment in <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a> from the club but declined, saying that they were 'substandard'. 
After a tumultuous one-month period as assistant coach for <a href="Zamalek%20SC">Zamalek</a>, he was sacked by the club in May 2016 and has expressed repentance over his premature dismissal. 
Following the end of his contract as assistant coach of <a href="Zamalek%20SC">Zamalek</a>, Nuttall joined <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>ian outfit <a href="Accra%20Hearts%20of%20Oak%20F.C.">Accra Hearts of Oak F.C.</a> in 2017.

Hennecke Volckens

Hennecke Volckens (16 August 1916 – 16 December 1942) was a German tank commander and recipient of the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Hauptmann Volckens was a company commander in the 3rd Panzer Division when it took up static positions in the Caucasus in late 1942. On 1 December Volckens was leading his company to reinforce the northern flank of his division when he went off course and began to run out of fuel. As the company waited for supply vehicles to catch up, a Russian brigade began to pass by in marching formation, having not seen Volckens and his men. The German tank company quickly formed up and took the brigade completely by surprise, destroying or capturing hundreds of men and much material including three tanks, two 12cm field guns and ten 7.62cm AT guns. For the successful annihilation of a Russian brigade, and without loss at that, Volckens was nominated for the Knight’s Cross. However he died due to injuries sustained in battle the day before he was due to receive it.

Yellow Head of Lake Simcoe

Yellow Head, "Chief of Lake Simcoe", was the "head chief" of the <a href="Chippewas">Chippewas</a> of Lakes Huron and Simcoe from sometime before 1797 until 1817. Evidently he was already exercising that office when, in the late summer of 1797, he led a contingent of some 140 of his Ojibwe to <a href="York%2C%20Upper%20Canada">York</a> and <a href="Niagara-on-the-Lake">Niagara</a>, the administrative centres of <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a>, seeking redress of grievances concerning absence of government contact and non-receipt of customary "annual Presents".

His son <a href="William%20Yellowhead">Musquakie</a>, similarly known as Yellow Head, and (after his conversion to <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a>) as William Yellowhead, seems to have assumed Yellow Head's chiefly duties by 1815, and in 1817 he formally replaced his father as head chief. The date and circumstances of Yellow Head's death are not known.

The line is operated on the relatively unusual single cable pulsed aerial ropeway principle, whereby the cabins are permanently fixed to the cable. To allow passengers to board and alight, the cable is stopped as each train of cabins passes through the stations. As there are four trains but only two stations, this means cabins also stop mid-flight.

The lower station of the cable car is located on the opposite bank of the <a href="River%20Derwent%2C%20Derbyshire">River Derwent</a> to the Heights of Abraham and the town of Matlock Bath, with the cabins crossing the river at the lower end of their journey.

Aguas Zarcas, Costa Rica

, which in turn belongs to the province of <a href="Alajuela%20Province">Alajuela</a> in <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>.

Location.
It is located in the northern region of the country. It borders the districts of Cutris to the north, La Palmera to the west, Pital and Venice to the east. While to the south it borders with the canton of Valverde Vega.

Its head, the city of Aguas Zarcas, from where it has an excellent view of the hills of the Juan Castro Blanco National Park, is located 16.6 km (30 minutes) NE of <a href="Quesada%2C%20Costa%20Rica">Quesada</a>, and 88.4 km (2 hours 20 minutes) to the NW of <a href="San%20Jos%C3%A9%2C%20Costa%20Rica">San José</a> the capital of the nation.

History.
From 1800, Germans, Italians and Spaniards formed the ancestors of Aguas Zarcas, the same ones that founded the Spanish colony. 

Its colonizers were in charge of carrying out bites in the mountain to facilitate the arrival to the inhabitants that came from Villa Quesada looking for a place where to live. 

The name of Aguas Zarcas, comes from the hot spring waters that could well be called "Aguas de azul suave".

Geography.
Aguas Zarcas has an area of 159.04 km², making it the eighth district of the canton by area.

It is located at an elevation of 100 to 2100 meters above sea level. 

This great variation of altitude is due to the fact that in the South of the district are the mountain foothills of the Central Mountain Range, whereas in a northerly direction, the territory follows a clear descent towards the plains of San Carlos.

Demography.
The district has 20, 239 inhabitants, making it the second most populated canton. Surpassing to <a href="Pital%2C%20Costa%20Rica">Pital</a>, <a href="La%20Fortuna%2C%20Costa%20Rica%29">La Fortuna</a> and <a href="Florencia%2C%20Costa%20Rica%29">Florencia</a>. 

The 17 population centers of the district are:


Art and Sport.
The district is home to one of the country's Civic Centers, which are special sports and recreational areas, promoted by the government and supported by private entities, to promote citizen coexistence through art and sport.

Culture.
Every year there are popular festivals in the community, where there are mechanical games and bullfights. Also must be mentioned a kind of horse riding call El Tope, in which the riders wear their best clothes on their colorful horses.

Economy.
Poultry has an important presence, with chicken farms distributed throughout the district.

Local crops of cassava and pineapple (along with citrus production from other districts) focused on exports form the basis of the local agroindustry, represented by processing plants and packing of tropical fruits and tubers.
In the city of Aguas Zarcas, there are health, educational, financial, legal, lodging, post, car repair and construction services. Entertainment services are also offered with synthetic courts, gyms, swimming pools and nightlife venues.
In terms of trade, the sale of fast foods, groceries, shoes, clothes, appliances and accessories in general stands out. Also vegetables, chicken meats and milk produced locally are brought to the center to be sold at different points of sale.

Striking sites.
1-The central square has a historical Catholic church. Although, earthquakes have destroyed much of the original Spanish architecture in Alajuela, this beautiful temple still stands. With an old construction style, it is undoubtedly the most representative symbol of the community. It rises impeccably in the center of the town, dominating the urban landscape and being observable from many points of the city.

2-Within the limits of the district, there are hot springs, the biggest tourist attraction in the surroundings (shares the deposits with the neighboring district of La Palmera). These sources of heated mineral water are not related to volcanism, but to the depth of where the waters flow, along tectonic faults.

Nikolai Aleksandrovich Rozhkov

Nikolai Rozhkov (1868–1927) () was a <a href="Russian%20people">Russian</a> historian who became an active revolutionary in the <a href="Russian%20Social-Democratic%20Labour%20Party">Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party</a> (R.S.D.L.P.).

In 1905 Rozhkov joined the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> faction of the R.S.D.L.P. At the <a href="5th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party</a> he was elected as a full member of the <a href="Central%20Committee%20elected%20by%20the%205th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">Central Committee</a>. However by 1907 he had fallen out with <a href="Lenin">Lenin</a> who maintained for him an enduring hatred.

Rozhkov's struggle for a legal party.
In February 1911 he submitted an article entitled "An Essential Initiative" to the legal Bolshevik paper "Zvezda". Here he argued three points:
<a href="Zinoviev">Zinoviev</a> responded to the article with a somewhat stern but friendly letter which reproved Rozhkov for his position, which he saw as comparable to the <a href="Liquidationism">liquidationists</a>. Rozhkov refused to give up his ideas, and wrote a second article "A System of Operation" in which h had advocated the establishment of an organisation called "The Political Society for the Protection of the Interests of the Working Class". He hoped this organisation would spread through workers organisations such as <a href="co-operatives">co-operatives</a> and <a href="trade%20unions">trade unions</a>, eventually to establish itself as a political party in the <a href="Duma">Duma</a>.
In a third article, "The Struggle for Legality".
These three articles eventually drew a response from Lenin in which the later declared that Rozhkov as a legalist was no different from a liquidationist. But Rozhkov was not scared of being called by such a name.
Rozhkov then wrote "The Contemporary Situation in Russia and the Fundamental Task of the Working Class Movement in the Present Moment". In the end the Bolsheviks refused to publish his articles, and this last article appeared in "<a href="Nasha%20Zarya">Nasha Zarya</a>". Whereas previously the argument between Lenin and Rozhkov had been through private letters. However Lenin now responded with "A Liberal Labour Party Manifesto" published in "Zvezda" No. 32, December 3, 1911.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
In the late stages of the battle of Kursk the 3rd Panzer Division was threatened by a large open flank to the west, and its commanders feared a Russian attack from this direction. However their concerns were not taken seriously by the higher commands and only minimal forces were permitted to cover an attack from this direction. When the Russian armoured attack did eventually materialize there was a very real danger it would threaten the rear areas of the entire 4th Panzer Army, were it not for the actions of Hauptmann Deichen. On his own initiative he took charge of a company of light APCs and one of SP anti-tank guns and drove into the Soviet flank, causing casualties in both tanks and men but more importantly buying time for the division to establish a new defensive line facing west. For his decisiveness at a critical moment Deichen was awarded the Knight’s Cross.

The eight-week run will consist of Springsteen performing five shows a week, Tuesday through Saturday, with a preview performance on October 3, 2017 and an official opening on October 12, 2017 with the shows concluding on November 26, 2017.

the shows will feature Springsteen performing his music, reading excerpts from his 2016 autobiography, "<a href="Born%20to%20Run%20%28autobiography%29">Born to Run</a>", and performing other spoken reminiscences written for the show.

Background.
On June 16, 2017 information leaked that Springsteen would be performing an eight-week run on Broadway in New York City at the 960 seat Walter Kerr Theatre in the fall of 2017. On August 9, 2017, the performances were made official by Springsteen's website. “Bruce has had this specific idea in mind since last December. It came into focus slowly and then all at once last January,” Springsteen's manager <a href="Jon%20Landau">Jon Landau</a> said in a statement.

Springsteen said of the performances “I wanted to do some shows that were as personal and as intimate as possible. I chose Broadway for this project because it has the beautiful old theaters which seemed like the right setting for what I have in mind. In fact, with one or two exceptions, the 960 seats of the Walter Kerr Theatre is probably the smallest venue I’ve played in the last 40 years. My show is just me, the guitar, the piano and the words and music. Some of the show is spoken, some of it is sung. It loosely follows the arc of my life and my work. All of it together is in pursuit of my constant goal to provide an entertaining evening and to communicate something of value,” says Springsteen.

The creative team for “Springsteen on Broadway” includes Heather Wolensky (scenic design), Natasha Katz (lighting design) and Brian Ronan (sound design).

Tickets.
In response to major issues with scalping and resales as seen on previous Springsteen tours, tickets will be made available exclusively through <a href="Ticketmaster">Ticketmaster Verified Fan</a>, a system put into place by Ticketmaster in February 2017 that levels the playing field to combat bots and get real tickets into the hands of the fans who intend to go to the event. Tickets for "Springsteen on Broadway" will go on sale at 10am ET on August 30. Registration for tickets opened on August 9 and will close on August 27. Verified fans will be notified on August 29 for the August 30 onsale date. Ticket prices range from $75-$850.

Fortifications of Vitré

The ramparts of Vitré are the fortifications built between the 13th and 17th centuries to protect the town of <a href="Vitr%C3%A9%2C%20Ille-et-Vilaine">Vitré</a> and <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> against the <a href="French%20Kingdom">French Kingdom</a>. The city was located near the Breton border, near <a href="Maine%20%28province%29">Maine</a>, <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a> and <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>. They cover an area of 8 hectares with a length of 500 m long and 200 m width. The fortifications of the thirteenth century are the best preserved in Brittany.

Situation.
The ramparts follow the contours of the rocky plateau where the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Vitr%C3%A9">Château de Vitré</a> and the urban nucleus developing around the Church of Notre-Dame<a href="https%3A//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C3%2589glise_Notre-Dame_de_Vitr%25C3%25A9"></a> are built. The construction of the ramparts was made according to the defensive strengths and constraints of the relief.

The town is located on a plateau with very deep valleys. To the north flows the river <a href="Vilaine">Vilaine</a> where there was a pond, swamps and a very high talus of 30 meters. The views over the landscape were excellent. In the south, the depression created by Vernouzet<a href="https%3A//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernouzet"></a> stream was an additional protection. The defensive fragility was to the east, direction from <a href="Laval%2C%20Mayenne">Laval</a> and the <a href="French%20Kingdom">French Kingdom</a>, beacause access was so easy.

Vitré is located in the <a href="Armorican%20Massif">Armorican Massif</a>, at the interface of zones of beige <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, and <a href="schists">schists</a> (argillites, black micaceous siltites, locally with ferruginous oolites). The ramparts are built with these materials available on the place. As a consequence, the exploitation of the stone has allowed the creation of large ditches to the south and east of the intramuros city of the order of 12 m (39 ft.) depth and a width of 20 m (66 ft.). A small supermarket in the rue de la Borderie has two levels of basement up to the level of the old ditches and illustrates these dimensions.

The inventory of the Baronnie de Vitré in 1681 testifies to the presence of springs and fountains in the moat, exploited by the inhabitants of the faubourgs for laundry, orchards and gardens.

History.
The ramparts were built in 1240 by Baron André III and reinforced with the development of artillery in the 15th century.

Vitré was a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> city, rich and prosperous. But during the <a href="religious%20wars">religious wars</a>, attacks by the <a href="Catholic%20League%20%28French%29">Catholic leagues</a> destroyed a part of the towers and ramparts east of the ancient city. At the end of the 16th century, a bastion was built in 1591.

The fortifications were destroyed in the south in the 19th century to connect the old town with the modern neighborhood. The <a href="Gare%20de%20Vitr%C3%A9">Gare de Vitré</a> arrived in 1857.

In 1987, the Tour des Claviers was discovered during the construction of a residential building. The old town is classified as a "remarkable heritage site" and the town borough engages in the renovation of this ramparts (Tour de la Bridole). All fortifications are classified "<a href="Monument%20Historique">historical monuments</a>" on January 15th, 2014.

The remains of walls and towers are the most outstanding to the north and east of the intramuros of Vitré, along the Promenade du Val with exceptionnal point of view.

Kate Brew Vaughn

Katherine (Kate) Margaret Brew Vaughn (October 22, 1873 - May 20, 1933) was an American author, lecturer, home economics teacher, newspaper writer and radio host.

Early life.
Kate Brew was born on October 22, 1873, in <a href="Hendersonville%2C%20Tennessee">Hendersonville, Tennessee</a>, the daughter of Patrick H. O'Gorman Brew (March 2, 1821 - September 12, 1898) and Catherine "Kate" White (January 1841 - May 15, 1907). She was a descendant of the Brews of County Clare, Ireland.

Brew took a special training in child welfare work at the <a href="Peabody%20College">Peabody College</a> in Nashville.

Career.
In 1911 Kate Brew Vaughn did her first cooking demonstration at the <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Fair">Tennessee State Fair</a> and after that she went to work for <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a> in Cincinnati to promote their new product, Crisco.

Vaughn traveled all around the United State from 1912 to 1914, becoming very popular gaving demonstrations on nutrition and cookings. Hundreds of people came to see her make one of her specialities, like the Japanese Fruit Cake (or Mikado Cake), more than once touted in newspaper articles.

On February 19, 1916, the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Herald-Express">Los Angeles Herald</a> touted: "With a Record-breaking attendance of housewives, clubwomen and teachers in attendance, Mrs. Kate Brew Vaughn, cooking expert, today closed the week’s course in Better Food, Better Homes which, under the auspices of The Evening Herald, she has been conducting at Walker auditorium, Mozart Theater building, 730 South Grand avenue. [...] Following the demonstration hundreds of women crowded round the famous celebrated domestic science expert to express their gratitude for the benefits they declare they have received through the Better Food, Better Homes free cooking course. [...] In concluding her talks to the Los Angeles women she urged them to get in close and constant touch with the public school teachers who are doing so much to develop the children."

In 1917 Vaughn worked in New York to test recipes for wartime shortages and rationing. She taught Americans how to make a Victory Cake, eggless, sugarless, and butterless; to a demonstration in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in April 1918, Vaughn told the crowd someone once told her they were also joyless, but then he ate three pieces.

Vaughn created the Bureau of Child Hygiene for the North Carolina State Board of Health and was its director, a position from which she resigned in September 1919.

Vaughn created the Home Economics Department at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Herald-Examiner">Los Angeles Evening Express</a> on January 12, 1920.

Since 1920 Vaughn was a lecturer on Home Economics, taught Home Economics in <a href="North%20Carolina%20State%20University">North Carolina State College</a>, gave radio lectures on Home Economics four mornings a week on <a href="KNX%20%28AM%29">KNX (AM)</a>. 

Vaughn wrote many booklets under the direction of <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>'s U.S. Food Commission for Boards of Health and manufacturers.

Vaughn was the author of "Table Treats in Wartime", "Culinary Echoes from Dixie", "Up-to-the-Minute Cook Book: A Collection of Tested Recipes", "My Best Recipes: A selection from twenty years' experience of adapting and proving tested recipes", "Art of Preserving and Canning". "Culinary Echoes from Dixie" and "My Best Recipes" are currently hot commodities in the historic cookbook circles.

Personal life.
On April 14, 1896, Kate Brew married William Weaver Vaughn (August 25, 1863, Nashville - May 19 1932, Nashville) and they had five children: Martha "Marte/Sis" Anne V.

Career.
Major Dietrich, commander of a Panzergrenadier battalion in the 3rd Panzer Division, received the Knight’s Cross for executing a daring counterattack on 5 April 1944. On the previous day the division’s two weak Panzergrenadier regiments had occupied positions around the village of Orhei, facing towards the north. The next day the Russians attacked with two battalions and fourteen tanks in support. They forced the Germans to evacuate the village and even got a tank over the bridge beyond it, cutting off the German line of retreat, before it was destroyed by an immobilized Panther. After another Russian tank had been knocked out by an AT gun the remainder fled. Confused, the Russian infantry began to abandon their gains as well. It was at this point that Major Dietrich decided to take advantage of the situation and he launched a counterattack with his battalion, retaking the old defensive positions at Orhei and giving his division valuable breathing space. This action would later be known to the soldiers of the division as “The Miracle of Orhei.”

Game of Thrones Tapestry

The Game of Thrones <a href="Tapestry">Tapestry</a> is a hand woven tapestry which is currently 66m (217ft) long. Opened to the public on the 21st July 2017 at the <a href="Ulster%20Museum">Ulster Museum</a> in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Once finished it will be longer than it’s inspiration, the <a href="Bayeux%20Tapestry">Bayeux Tapestry</a> at 77m (253ft). The tapestry tells the entire story of the of the television show, <a href="Game%20of%20Thrones">Game of Thrones</a>. Comprised of six 11 metre long panels of hand woven fabric, to which will be added a further seven panels, each 1.5 metres. The six long panels depict scenes from the first six series. As season 7 is aired weekly (in 2017) the tapestry will grow an extra 1.5m to reflect that weeks episode.

Campaign background.
The Game of Thrones Tapestry is a campaign which celebrates Northern Ireland and its historic contribution to the legacy linen mills which once was the largest linen and textile industry in its time. At the end of the 19th century it has been estimated that over 100,000 people in the north of Ireland were employed in the manufacture and decoration of linen.

Today the Irish linen and textile industry is very much smaller, where the vast majority of the Northern Irish are employed by the ever growing Game of Thrones tourist industry.

Commissioned by Tourism Ireland and <a href="HBO">HBO</a>. <a href="Publicis">Publicis</a> London the advertising agency generated this campaign to help the global audience understand this shift in employment.

The tapestry was made from material which represents that the late 18th century (linen) and a used a technique passed on from generations (embroidery). The tapestry was hand embroidered by some of the last few people remaining in the industry in Northern Ireland.

Game of Thrones influence.
Traditional tapestries tell the stories of times gone by, and have represented history and heritage from as far back as 3rd Century BC. The typical medieval style of Game of Thrones along with the many scenes have been used to influence and craft the illustrated style of tapestry. As some garments worn in the show have been supplied by the Irish textile trade, the tapestry also contains these same woven yarns. The yarns used in the tapestry have been supplied by Thomas Ferguson and Co. Ltd of Banbridge in associations with the Irish Linen Guild.

The style of characters have been carefully designed to reflect those from the show. <a href="Publicis">Publicis London</a> worked closely with HBO ensuring all characters were true to show and their role during that particular scene. The tapestry has drawn some controversy around famous cameos and whether they have also been included.

In July 2017 the online website was launched. The site allows those who are not able to visit the tapestry see the entire tapestry to an incredible detail. Users can scroll the entire length of the tapestry and even zoom in to see each and every individual stitch. The website was updated as each new section was woven. The site carefully plots those filming locations (Castle Ward, Shillanavogy Valley, Inch Abbey, Dark Hedges, Downhill Beach, Ballintoy Harbour, Cushendun Caves, Audley’s Field Pollnagollum Caves) famous to Northern Ireland and presents further key facts within the show and each location. The site encourages users to share their favourite key scenes.

Manufacturing process.
Creative design.
The tapestry began production with a set of avid Game of Thrones fans in Publicis London who employ a skilled group of illustrators from an established animation/illustration studio in London called Jelly London. The illustrators also huge fans, would start by creating an outline sketch using both pen, paper and also digital touch screen. Sketches would be in black and white with the aim of identifying the correct style, tone of voice, scale and detail, for approval by HBO and Tourism Ireland. Once approved the line drawings would passed through the colorisation phase. The colorisation phase is a lengthy process of converting the monochrome designs into a colored piece of illustrated artwork. This process considers line widths, contrasts and resolution and also identifies the correct color pallet to use per section. All which is predefined by the TC2 looms technical capability.  
The illustrated artwork generated by the colorisation phase was created by <a href="http%3A//jellylondon.com/">Jelly London</a>.

Weaving.
The illustrated artwork is then passed to a hand woven specialist. Highly skilled at their trade the artists called <a href="http%3A//www.dashandmiller.com/">Dash & Miller</a> started the weaving process by setting up their loom to the required specification. Several test were carried during the early stages of the campaign to determine the design density and the range of colors possible. A specialist software is used to help translate the artwork into a format readable by the loom. Once programmed the team at Dash & Miller begin weaving. Using a rota of shifts the team weave using the color pallets instructed by the loom. The average speed of weaving is 4 hours per meter. To capture the weekly episodes a camera was installed above the loom. The SLR was set to take regular shots during the weaving process, the photos were stitched together by digital production company <a href="https%3A//www.space66.com/">Space66</a> to create the weekly time-lapse.

Embroidery.
Once woven, the 11 meter section of tapestry would be shipped to Belfast to be embroidered. The <a href="Ulster%20Folk%20and%20Transport%20Museum">Ulster Folk and Transport Museum</a>, near Holywood Co. Down was used as the secret location for this work. Key areas on the tapestry was selected to be embroidered by a team of 30 stitchers working in groups of 6 and 9 at a time.  The embroidery ‘team’ included six staff from the museum, all with an interest in or responsibility for aspects of textiles at the museum, from collections management, period costume, linen weaving, and front of house interpretation.

The embroidery could not have been completed on time without a massive input from volunteers drawn from textiles guilds that have a thirty – year relationship with the museum. Members of the Northern Ireland lace Guild, Patchwork Guild, and Embroidery Guild responded to the call for help with embroidery and joined staff at the museum to stitch on a daily basis for over three weeks. The ages of these volunteers ranged from Aimee, a recent textiles graduate in her mid – twenties, to Peggy, an 82 year-old with a background in the garment stitching industry.  

Loom setup and programming.
Machine set-up and Weaving.
The jacquard loom used for weaving the tapestry is a hand-operated TC2 weaving loom from Digital Weaving Norway. This loom is the latest technology in hand-woven jacquard design and allows the hand-weaver to create intricate and complex patterns by hand.

The black and white cotton warp threads first need to be wound onto the loom. This is done in 64m lengths, and the threads are wound onto the back beam of the loom. The warp has 60 threads per inch and is approximately 20 inches wide, each thread needs to be threaded through a heddle in the middle of the loom, and then through the reed at the front of the loom. This threading process is done by hand using a threading hook. Once the machine is threaded up, the warp threads are secured at the front of the loom onto the front beam. The loom then needs to be calibrated to advance the warp threads at the correct speed to weave 84 threads per inch.

To begin the weaving process, Dash & Miller weave 1 or 2 inches of plain weave at the beginning of the warp. This spaces out the warp threads properly and also evens out any tension issues. 
They can then begin weaving the tapestry, passing the 3 colours of thread by hand through the shed created by lifting the warp threads up and down. The computer controls which threads are lifted up and down, but the weft yarns are passed through the shed by hand. Weaving builds up at a rate of approximately 11 inches per hour, and the weaving is stored on the cloth storage beam at the front of the weaving loom.

Once the weaving is completed, they weave another 1 or 2 inch plain weave border before cutting the weaving off the loom, ensuring the warp threads are still threaded so they can tie on and begin the process again for the next panel.

CAD design and Colour Palettes.
Using specialist weaving software from Pointcarre the illustrators artwork first needs to be calibrated for the jacquard loom, taking into consideration the weave construction and warp and weft yarns. The warp yarns are 2/30NE Cotton in black and white end-on-end, and the weft yarns are 1/10NM Flax and Linen (we need the yarn information from the linen mill).

The construction of the fabric are combinations of double-cloth and double-faced satins and sateen structures over 4 ends. The combinations of 3/1 and 1/3 satin structures, together with blending of warp and weft colours allow us to create different shades within a colour spectrum that bring depth and intricacy to the weave.

The illustrators artwork is converted into a weave file by first defining the colours within the 4 colour palettes we have created for the construction. The weave uses 3 weft colours throughout the piece, and this is split into colour palette in the following way:

<br>
<br>
During the weaving process Dash & Miller blend 3 colours together in the weft, so the illustrators clearly mark which sections of the design should be woven in each colour palette. They then manually swap between colour palette during the weaving process.

The weave has 84 threads per cm in the weft, and to ensure the scale is kept true to the designs the artwork then needs to be stretched and rotated. The CAD is stretched by 140% to allow the weaving to come out at the same scale as the original illustrators artwork. The artwork is rotated by 90 degrees counter-clockwise so that the piece can be woven as a continuous length on the loom.

Once the artwork has been scaled and the colours defined, Dash & Miller then allocate weave structures to each colour in the CAD using our Pointcarre Jacquard software. Each colour within the 4 colour-palettes that has been created for the weave has its own weave structure that they can then attach to the colour in the CAD to create the weave file. Dash & Miller also add in borders and selvedge to the weave to ensure clean edges to the design.

Once the weave file has been generated, it is then export it as a weave file to the computer that the jacquard loom reads the pattern from so we can begin hand-weaving.

Thomas Fergusons Irish Linen.
<a href="Thomas%20Ferguson%20%26amp%3B%20Co%20Ltd">Fergusons</a> was first established in Banbridge, County Down, for the hand weaving of linen fabric.  In 1867 the firm introduced power driven jacquard looms for the weaving of linen damask. John England (Banbridge) Ltd, since 2015 a sister company of Fergusons, regularly supplies fabrics for major theatrical and film productions, including Game of Thrones.  Over its 170 year plus history Fergusons has not only woven fabrics, both plain and damask but supported a related industry in the decoration of linen handkerchiefs, bedlinens and table linens.

Jacquard looms.
The loom used to create the panels is a small modern version of that developed by Frenchman Joseph Marie Jacquard, the son of a Lyonnais silk weaver, in 1804.  His development based on earlier work by fellow Frenchmen Basile Bouchon in 1725, Jean Baptiste Falcon in 1728, and Jacques Vaucason in 1741.  Put simply, a jacquard loom is one in which a series of punched cards each corresponds to a row of the design to be woven, allowing for a greater definition of motifs.  The punched cards operate a mechanism attached to the loom, controlling the pick-up of weft threads as the design evolves.  In the case of the Game of Thrones tapestry it has allowed the weavers to introduce a rich palette of colours and considerable level of detail throughout the work.

Jacquard looms have often been credited with inspiring the development of the very first computers.  The English mathematician, engineer, and inventor Charles Babbage (1791 – 1871) is believed to have been inspired by jacquard loom mechanisms in his development of the first digital programmable computer.

During her college years, she adopted conservative views after finding that <a href="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> and other government welfare programs she had expected to help her after her mother's death were inefficient and ineffective, as well as due to the influence of college friends and the writings of <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a>.

Her effective advocacy for conservative causes led to her being named as one of "36 under 36" individuals reinventing Jewish life by "<a href="the%20Jewish%20Week">the Jewish Week</a>" in 2013.

Activism on behalf of Orthodox converts.
Mandel was born to a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> mother and a <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> father, and sought out <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a> Barry Freundel for an Orthodox conversion that would make her Jewish status universally recognized. She completed her conversion in 2011, and in 2014 learned that the rabbi had filmed her naked while preparing her for conversion. She wrote an article entitled "The Convert Bill of Rights" that went <a href="Viral%20phenomenon">viral</a>, making her a spokeswoman for the many victims of the Freundel scandal, and the <a href="Rabbinical%20Council%20of%20America">Rabbinical Council of America</a> asked her to join a committee to prevent future such abuses. For this work, the Forward named her one of the "Forward 50" in 2015, and Rutger's Hillel honored her with their Young Alumni Award at its 2016 Annual Gala.

Paul-Georg Kleffel

Paul-Georg Kleffel (7 September 1920 – present) was a German mechanized infantry commander and recipient of the <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. 

Career.
Oberleutnant Kleffel was a company commander in the reconnaissance battalion of the 3rd Panzer Division during early 1944. During the division’s defense of Orhei, on 13 April, the Soviets succeeded in reaching a defile in regimental strength just short of a patch of woods to the east of Orhei. From where his company was positioned Kleffel determined if the Russians made it to the woods they would be in a position to compromise the division’s entire defensive position. He launched a counterattack with his eight APCs, and despite fire from Russian AT guns he was able to reach the defile and opened fire, scattering the Russian infantry that were gathered there. He continued to pursue the Russian regiment across the bridge where it had come from, inflicting heavy losses, and pulled back across before the Russians were able to take countermeasures. For his successful spoiling attack Kleffel was awarded the Knight’s Cross.

The Donkin Heritage Trail is named after the acting Governor of the Cape Colony, <a href="Rufane%20Shaw%20Donkin">Rufane Shaw Donkin</a>

The trail links 51 places of historical interest and showcases settler history from as early as 1820. Sites include groups of double-storey semi-detached houses with prominent <a href="Victorian">Victorian</a> and <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> features. These were erected shortly after the turn of the 20th century. It consists of five residences in Donkin Street, facing onto the Donkin Reserve. One of the residential homes is located at 14 Constitution Street and two others located at 8 and 10 Whitlock Street. The Donkin Street complex forms a notable row of terrace houses, and is one of the city's most prominent landmarks. Many of the landmarks have been declared national monuments. 
Main Library.
The Main Library building with Victorian Gothic architecture, is on the corner of Market Square.

Queen Victoria Statue.
A marble statue of Queen Victoria stands at the entrance of the library. 
Market Square.
The trail begins at this site, the centrepiece of the Market Square is the City Hall. There is a replica of the Diaz Cross, commemorating the first European to sail into <a href="Algoa%20Bay">Algoa Bay</a> in 1488. 
City Hall.
The City Hall is central to the Market square and dates back to 1858. 
Prester John Memorial.
The <a href="Prestor%20John">Prestor John</a> Memorial is a Coptic Cross with two figures inside it. It commemorates the <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> explorers who discovered <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> as well as the story of a far older mythical figure named Prestor John. Between the 12th and 18th centuries <a href="Prestor%20John">Prestor John</a> was believed to have been an early <a href="Christian">Christian</a> King and one of the descendants of the <a href="Three%20Magi">Three Magi</a> of Christian belief. He was the ‘patron’ of Christian exploration of the world and is seen as ‘a symbol to European Christians of the Church’s universality, transcending culture and geography to encompass all humanity’ and therefore a figurehead for Portuguese sailors and explorers.

Campanile.
The Campanile is a 120-foot bell tower, which was built in the 1920s to commemorate the 1820 Dutch/French Settlers who became the <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> people of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. The first proposal for a memorial tower to commemorate the landing of the British Settlers of 1820, was made in 1904 by the Reverend Alfred E Hall, a minister of the Queen Street Baptist Church. On 9 April 1921, the foundation stone of the Campanile was laid by H R H Prince Arthur of Connaught, governor of the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a>. On 10 March 1922, the design for the Campanile was approved and the contract for building the structure was subsequently awarded on 18 March 1922 to a local firm of builders, Harris and Harrower Limited. The tender was worth £6 150. It took approximately 18 months to complete the campanile. The dressed stone, used to construct the base, was taken from some of the oldest buildings in the city and the arched main doorway was built of stone quarried in <a href="Grahamstown">Grahamstown</a>. The tower is made of brick and reinforced with concrete. Each brick went through a selective test before being used. The structure, both base and belfry, is made of local brick faced with smooth, red Grahamstown bricks. The roof tiles were also obtained from Grahamstown.

Architecturally, the Campanile is well-proportioned, lofty and slender and simple. The structure is reminiscent of the famous St Mark's Campanile in Venice, which is 320 feet high. The Campanile in Port Elizabeth is 170 feet high from ground level to the tip of the pyramid roof. The area of the structure at the base is 23 feet square, its foundation resting upon sea-worn rock. The windows at different floor levels are fitted with decorative precast concrete grilles and the belfry. There are eight floors within the tower and to reach the observation floor, which is approximately 136 feet above the floor level of the reception area, the visitor has to climb 204 steps. The frieze of the reception area is artistically inscribed with brief details of the events connected with the erection of the Campanile.

The tower was erected at a final cost of £5 940, but there was, as yet, no clock and no bells for the proposed carillon, and efforts were set afoot to raise funds for that purpose. The largest bell in the carillon is about 6 feet in diameter and weighs between three and four tons. The bells were hoisted into position in the belfry during July 1936 and the first recital on the carillon was given on 9 September by Lionel Field, Mus Bac, ARCM.

Six of the bells were sponsored by descendants of 1820 Settlers as a tribute to their forebears, or by others who wished to honour their memory. Details are embossed on each of the 23 bells which are engraved on a brass plaque affixed to a wall in the reception area of the Campanile.
Bells are rung from the campanile three times a day. The 204-step spiral staircase leads to views over <a href="Algoa%20Bay">Algoa Bay</a>. The Campanile is partially overshadowed by the Settler's Freeway, however, it remains a focal point of the city's built environment. 
Railway Station.
The <a href="Port%20Elizabeth%20railway%20station">Port Elizabeth railway station</a>, located north of the Campanile, and the Railway Station building existed since 1875, when the first line was constructed to <a href="Uitenhage">Uitenhage</a> approximately 40 Kilometres away. The original building was designed by James Bisset, Resident Engineer, Harbour and Public Works. Additions including the cast-iron supported roof of the main concourse, were designed by E.J. Sherwood and was completed by 1893. S.A. Transport Services renovated the station which was re-opened on 8 August 1985. 

Old Harbour Board Building.
The Harbour Board Building, a national monument, is also known as 'the White House'. It is situated on the Remainder of Erf 1762, Port Elizabeth Central, in the Municipality and Division of Port Elizabeth and measures 3 Morgen 41 square roods 141.4 square feet.

The museum is a private <a href="nonprofit%20organization">nonprofit organization</a> with approximately 12 full-time staff, 90 volunteers, and a 16-member board of trustees. It receives about 100,000 visitors each year. The museum also operates a store that sells books, educational toys, and souvenirs related to Idaho and the exhibits. 

<a href="NASA">NASA</a> has designated the Museum of Idaho as an official viewing location for the <a href="solar%20eclipse%20of%20August%2021%2C%202017">solar eclipse of August 21, 2017</a>. To commemorate the event, the museum is holding a series of lectures by NASA scientists and hands-on activities for kids.

History.
The Village Improvement Society – a club founded by <a href="Idaho%20Falls">Idaho Falls</a> women in 1898 to beautify and bring culture to the community – secured a $15,000 grant from the <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation%20of%20New%20York">Carnegie Foundation</a> to build a public library at the intersection of Eastern Avenue and Elm Street. The <a href="Carnegie%20library">Carnegie library</a> was completed in 1916 and served the town for decades before the library outgrew the building and moved to its present location on Broadway. The <a href="Bonneville%20County%2C%20Idaho">Bonneville County</a> Historical Society (BCHS) lobbied to save the then-vacant building from demolition in 1975, and renovated it for the Bonneville Museum. The museum had originally been housed in a small room in the <a href="Bonneville%20County%2C%20Idaho">Bonneville County</a> Courthouse. 

In 1992, in anticipation of future growth, the BCHS purchased property immediately north of the Carnegie building. With help from another private donation of adjacent land, construction began in 2001 on an expansion that enhanced the museum’s scope and tripled its size to 30,700 sq. ft. The enhanced institution was renamed the Museum of Idaho and re-opened in 2003. 

Since then, the museum has continued to grow, hosting traveling exhibits, more than doubling its collection size, and expanding education and outreach programs. As of 2017, the museum had begun planning another expansion to nearly double its size and provide more space for regional exhibits and artifacts currently in storage, including a life-sized replica of a <a href="Columbian%20mammoth">Columbian mammoth</a>.

Collections.

Notable experiences include the Children’s Discovery Center, which includes interactive displays relating to early settlers and natural history; “Eagle Rock, USA”, a walkthrough of a street in the 19th-century frontier town before it became <a href="Idaho%20Falls%2C%20Idaho">Idaho Falls</a>; and the <a href="Andrew%20Henry%20%28fur%20trader%29">Andrew Henry</a> Rock, which displays the earliest known English-language writing in <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> (from 1810).

Temporary Regional Exhibits.
In addition, the museum develops regular exhibits on other topics of regional interest, such as the development of newspapers in eastern Idaho and pioneering local institutions. The museum also holds an "Olde Fashioned Christmas and Winter Festival" exhibit each December.

Research and Archives.
The museum houses an active collection that houses about 25,000 artifacts and continues to collect documents and objects, as well as stories through an oral history project. Its reading and reference room is open to the public and researchers by appointment.

Traveling Exhibits.
In addition to its permanent collections and temporary regional displays, the museum hosts between one and three nationally and internationally touring exhibits each year on a variety of themes.

<doc id="54827510" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54827510" title="Tobias G. Mealey House">
Tobias G. Mealey House

The Tobias G. Mealey House is a historic house in <a href="Monticello%2C%20Minnesota">Monticello, Minnesota</a>, United States. Its original section was built in 1855 by <a href="Tobias%20Mealey">Tobias Mealey</a> (1823–1904). The Mealey family made numerous additions to the house throughout the latter 19th century, and later owners added a large wing to the east. The house was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1976 for having local significance in the themes of commerce, exploration/settlement, and politics/government. It was nominated for its association with Mealey, an influential local settler, entrepreneur, and politician.

Description.
The Tobias G. Mealey House stands in seclusion on a thickly vegetated hill on the outskirts of Monticello's historic core. The original section is a simple two-story <a href="framing%20%28construction%29">frame</a> building with <a href="gable">gable</a>s adorned with open <a href="pediment">pediment</a>s. The main entrance was on the west façade, which was spanned at one time by a <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a>d porch. The house gradually developed a rambling, complex structure with the addition of porches, <a href="gable">gable</a>s, chimneys, and rooms, including a kitchen and summer kitchen extending to the east, and the main entrance shifted to the southeast corner. However a consistent exterior treatment of narrow-lap <a href="clapboard%20%28architecture%29">clapboard</a> maintained uniformity. Later owners added a full <a href="wing%20%28building%29">wing</a> to the east, which contained a garage and antique shop at the time of the house's National Register nomination in 1976.

History.
Tobias Mealey grew up in <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, Canada, but went west in his late 20s to participate in the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>. Returning to New Brunswick in 1852 he passed through Minnesota and liked what he saw there. In 1855 he married Catherine Prescott and together they emigrated to Minnesota. <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul</a> was too well established for him and <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> had yet to come into prominence, so Mealey opted to settle in Monticello, then still called Moritzious. He sited their house on a hill away from the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> riverfront to get away from the boatmen and lumberjacks he deemed unsavory.

Mealey invested in several businesses, including a <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a>, two factories, and a <a href="general%20store">general store</a>, helping to grow Monticello's economy. He also farmed the property around the house. Active in politics, he served in some local judicial positions before running for office in the <a href="Minnesota%20Legislature">Minnesota Legislature</a> as a Democrat, where he served several terms in the 1870s. He forged connections with other influential Minnesotans, selling land to <a href="Thomas%20Lowry">Thomas Lowry</a> for a summer home and becoming close friends with railroad magnate <a href="James%20J.%20Hill">James J. Hill</a>.

Tobias and Catherine Mealey had two sons and three daughters, and their growing family prompted successive additions to the house. In 1884 their daughter Susan married Rufus Rand, then vice-president of the Minneapolis Gas Light Company. As a wedding gift, the Mealeys gave the couple a large lot next to their own, upon which Susan designed the 30-room <a href="Rand%20House">Rand House</a> as a summer home. James J. Hill had a railroad spur constructed nearby for the convenience of his friend's wedding guests.

Tobias Mealey died in 1904, whereupon Catherine moved in with one of their daughters. The Mealey family continued to use the house as a summer home until about 1940. It stood vacant until 1947, when it was purchased by Carl and Jeanette Sebey, who undertook a restoration. After the Sebeys moved out the house suffered another period of vacancy during which it was vandalized, inhabited by skunks, and encroached on by vegetation. Antique dealers Bob and Marion Jameson purchased the property in 1965 and began restorations again. As of the 2010s, though, the house appears to be vacant once more.

History.
It started operations on January 27, 1878 as the District Telephone Company of New Haven. It was the founder of the first telephone exchange, as well as the world's first telephone book.

SNET and <a href="Cincinnati%20Bell">Cincinnati Bell</a> were the only two companies in the old <a href="Bell%20System">Bell System</a> that <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Corporation">the old AT&T</a> only had a minority stake in; by 1983, AT&T's stake was only 19.6 percent. Therefore, neither is considered a <a href="Bell%20Operating%20Company">Bell Operating Company</a>; rather, they are considered independents.

Sale to SBC.
The Southern New England Telephone Company was purchased for $4.4 billion in 1998 by SBC Communications, which subsequently purchased the old AT&T, taking its name as the "new" AT&T. Under AT&T The Southern New England Telephone Company was known as AT&T Connecticut.

Joseph Snake

Joseph Snake was an <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a> chief belonging to the <a href="Chippewas%20of%20Lakes%20Huron%20and%20Simcoe">Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe</a> from sometime before 1842 until his death in 1861.

Having relinquished virtually all of their territory west of Lake Simcoe to the government of <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a> in the <a href="Lake%20Simcoe%E2%80%93Lake%20Huron%20Purchase">Lake Simcoe–Lake Huron Purchase</a> of 1815 and the <a href="Lake%20Simcoe%E2%80%93Nottawasaga%20Purchase">Lake Simcoe–Nottawasaga Purchase</a> of 1818, these Ojibwe converted to <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a> in 1828 and were persuaded by Lieutenant Governor <a href="John%20Colborne%2C%201st%20Baron%20Seaton">John Colborne</a> to settle permanently in 1830 in purpose-built villages at <a href="Severn%2C%20Ontario">Coldwater</a> and Atherley Narrows between Lakes Simcoe and <a href="Lake%20Couchiching">Couchiching</a>.. At the same time, Colborne set aside <a href="Georgina%20Island">Georgina Island</a>, <a href="Snake%20Island">Snake Island</a>, and <a href="Fox%20Island">Fox Island</a> in <a href="Lake%20Simcoe">Lake Simcoe</a> as a reservation for the Ojibwe.

A change of government in 1836, <a href="Francis%20Bond%20Head">Francis Bond Head</a> replacing Colborne as Lieutenant Governor, soon brought this "civilising" experiment to an end. Bond Head persuaded the Ojibwe to leave the Narrows-Coldwater corridor (which remained Crown land) in return for one-third of the proceeds of the anticipated sales of lots there to future European settlers. In 1842, their leading chiefs, <a href="William%20Yellowhead">Musquakie</a> (otherwise known as William Yellowhead), head chief and leader of the Narrows settlement, and <a href="John%20Aisance">John Aisance</a>, leader of the Coldwater settlement, wrote to Governor General <a href="Charles%20Bagot">Charles Bagot</a> protesting that Bond Head had not fully explained this purchase agreement, and had, in particular, not made it clear that it did not involve an upfront, lump-sum payment, nor that the Ojibwe would receive only one-third of the sale proceeds. One of the four other chiefs who subscribed to this letter was Joseph Snake, whose signature occurs immediately after that of Musquakie, and before that of Aisance in the list.

As a result of the 1836 agreement, the Ojibwe were obliged to abandon their villages at the Narrows and Coldwater and make homes elsewhere. Whereas Musquakie led the Narrows band to a new settlement at nearby <a href="Mnjikaning%20First%20Nation%2032">Rama</a> in 1838, and Aisance led the Coldwater band to <a href="Beausoleil%20Island">Beausoleil Island</a> in <a href="Georgian%20Bay">Georgian Bay</a> in 1842, it seems that the Ojibwe who had settled after 1830 on Snake Island and the other islands of Lake Simcoe remained in place with Joseph Snake as their chief. They sustained themselves by hunting and fishing, although a certain amount of farming was also taking place. By 1858 this "Snake Island band" was regarded by the government as a distinct community from the Rama band (now the <a href="Chippewas%20of%20Rama%20First%20Nation">Chippewas of Rama First Nation</a>) and the Beausoleil band (now the <a href="Beausoleil%20First%20Nation">Beausoleil First Nation</a>), but they retained close links to Rama, whose Methodist preacher ministered to them. The band was the historical antecedent of the <a href="Chippewas%20of%20Georgina%20Island%20First%20Nation">Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation</a>.

Chief Joseph Snake died in 1861.. Chief Joseph Snake Road on Georgina Island was named for him.

Syllis ramosa

Syllis ramosa is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="polychaete">polychaete</a> worm in the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Syllidae">Syllidae</a>. It is found in the deep sea where it lives within the tissues of a sponge. It was the first branching polychaete worm to be discovered, with each worm having a single head and multiple anuses.

History.
During the period 1872 to 1876, the Royal Navy's <a href="HMS%20Challenger%20%281858%29">HMS Challenger</a> was used in the <a href="Challenger%20expedition">Challenger expedition</a> to survey and explore the world's oceans. One of the unknown animals dredged from the ocean depths near the Philippines was a species of <a href="sponge">sponge</a> which was found to contain numerous branching worms inside its cavities. In 1879, one of these worms was <a href="Species%20description">formally described</a> by the Scottish marine biologist <a href="William%20M%27Intosh">William Carmichael McIntosh</a>, who named it "Syllis ramosa". Branching polychaete worms were previously unknown.

Distribution.
This bristle worm was first discovered living <a href="Commensalism">commensally</a> with a sponge at a depth of about near the Philippines and at a depth of in the <a href="Arafura%20Sea">Arafura Sea</a>. Further branching worms have occasionally been found in different locations and have been ascribed to "S. ramosa" despite subtle differences in morphology; they are hard to examine because of the difficulty of extracting them from the sponge tissue. However a new species of branching worm ("<a href="Ramisyllis%20multicaudata">Ramisyllis multicaudata</a>") was described in 2012.

Ecology.
The heads of the two individual "S. ramosa" brought to the surface by the Challenger were located in the bases of glass sponges of the class <a href="Hexactinellid">Hexactinellid</a>a. The rest of the worms' bodies were in the passages of the sponges. The bodies branched repeatedly so that each worm had a single head and many <a href="anus">anus</a>es. 

"S. ramosa" is a "stolonate" worm and has a bizarre <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>. The terminal portion of a branch is known as a "stolon", and develops an extra head with large eyes and no mouth. The gut in this part of the animal is absorbed, the muscles are rearranged to facilitate swimming and the stolon becomes a storage receptacle for the eggs or sperm. When the breeding period arrives, the stolon becomes detached and swims to the surface of the sea. Here the gametes are released and the stolon dies. Meanwhile, the parent worm remains safely in its sponge home and produces more stolons.
