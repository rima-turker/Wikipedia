William J. Oswald

William Joseph Oswald (July 6, 1919 – December 8, 2005) was an American educator, scientist, and engineer who spent his entire academic career at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> in the departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Public Health. He made foundational contributions to the fields of <a href="wastewater%20treatment">wastewater treatment</a> and applied <a href="phycology">phycology</a>, or as he called it, "algology". Throughout a career spanning more than five decades, Oswald was the primary academic advisor to more than two dozen doctoral students, sat on more than 100 additional masters and doctoral thesis committees, and taught seminal courses in applied algology.

Early life, military service, and education.
Oswald was born in <a href="King%20City%2C%20California">King City, California</a> in 1919. He grew up on a ranch in that area, where the arid climate stoked his interest in water supplies, wastewater treatment, and water use. In World War II, he served in the Army Air Forces and was responsible for water safety at one of the <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a> invasion camps. Oswald remained in the Army in Europe after the war, working in a hospital where he cared for patients suffering from waterborne ailments and met his life-long wife, an American nurse. Returning home to California, he obtained a degree in civil engineering from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> in 1950 on the <a href="G.I.%20Bill">G.I. Bill</a>. He then continued his studies and was awarded an M.S. (1951) and Ph.D. (1957) in sanitary engineering, biology and public health. Oswald joined the faculty of the university the same year and went on to become a full professor in 1970. He remained in the position his entire career, staying on as an emeritus professor after his retirement.

Career.
Oswald studied the role of algae in wastewater treatment as a student, winning recognition from the American Society of Civil Engineers for his early work. He continued investigating the use of microalgae in sanitation throughout his career, developing strategies for combining engineered algae ponds to obtain specific water treatment goals. He developed the "high rate pond system" of shallow, mixed <a href="raceway%20pond">raceway ponds</a> to maximize algae productivity. This design is still in use today, responsible for over 90% of the world's commercial microalgae production. His work led to the development of the "Advanced Integrated Wastewater Pond System", in which wastewater flows through a series of ponds, starting with deeper "facultative" ponds, then high rate ponds, and finally maturation ponds. The research undertaken by Oswald and his students and collaborators provided the foundations for much of modern microalgae wastewater treatment technology. Wastewater treatment plants based on his designs operate throughout the world today.

With broader implications in energy and nutrient cycles, Oswald’s work often crossed over into related fields such as waste energy recovery, biofuels, animal feeds, and waste nutrient reuse. The <a href="Air%20Force%20of%20the%20United%20States">Air Force</a>’s interest in waste and nutrient recycling for long term space missions led to Oswald’s development of the <a href="Algatron">Algatron</a>–a device that would grow microalgae on astronaut waste, treating water and also producing oxygen and food.

An <a href="https%3A//ceenve.calpoly.edu/oswald/">archive</a> of Oswald's work is maintained by former student and long time collaborator Tryg Lundquist, now a professor of <a href="Environmental%20Engineering">Environmental Engineering</a> at <a href="Cal%20Poly%2C%20San%20Luis%20Obispo">Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo</a>.

Awards and honors.
Oswald was recognized throughout his career, starting with the Harrison Prescott Eddy Medal in 1953 from the Water Pollution Control Federation (now known as the <a href="Water%20Environment%20Federation">Water Environment Federation</a>) for describing photosynthetic oxygenation. The <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> awarded him both the Rudolf Hering Medal and the James Croes Medal in 1957 for work describing the fixation of nutrients and capture of solar energy by microalgae and the Arthur M. Wellington Award in 1966 for various investigations of life support systems for extended space travel. In 2005 he was awarded the lifetime achievement prize of the International Society for Applied Phycology and in 2006 he was nominated for the <a href="Stockholm%20Water%20Prize">Stockholm Water Prize</a>.

Problem Solvers Caucus

Created in January 2017, the Problem Solvers Caucus is a bi-partisan group in Congress that includes approximately 40 members– equally divided between Democrats and Republicans – who are committed to forging bi-partisan cooperation on key issues. It is co-chaired by <a href="Josh%20Gottheimer">Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ)</a> and <a href="Tom%20Reed%20%28politician%29">Rep. Tom Reed (R-NY)</a>. 

Writing in the New York Times about the formation of the Caucus, Reed and Gottheimer said: “We all knew the partisanship in Washington had gotten out of control and felt the need to create a bipartisan group committed to getting to “yes” on important issues.” We have agreed to vote together for any policy proposal that garners the support of 75 percent of the entire Problem Solvers Caucus, as well as 51 percent of both the Democrats and Republicans in the caucus.” 

The Problem Solvers Caucus developed over time as an outgrowth of informal meetings organized by the political reform group <a href="No%20Labels">No Labels</a>. Past successes include the introduction of nine bipartisan bills to reduce government waste and inefficiency and the passage of the "No Budget, No Pay Act" of 2013. 

The Caucus’ signature success to date occurred on July 31, 2017, when its members unified behind a bipartisan health care fix to shore up the nation’s struggling health insurance exchanges and to reduce premiums for individuals, families and small businesses. "The Washington Post" described the Caucus plan as “a viable bipartisan compromise focused on stabilizing health-care markets rather than enforcing one party’s will on the nation.”

Opera Magna

Opera Magna are a <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="Power%20Metal">Power Metal</a> band based in <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>. They were formed in 1997 and have released two studio albums, two demos and two extended plays. 

Foundation.
In 1997, Guitarists Mompó and Nula began the composition of the album <a href="El%20%C3%9Altimo%20Caballero">The Last Knight</a>. Upon finishing the album, they started to look for the right musicians to complete the lineup. The first to be part of the group was Fernando Asensi (drummer and producer), who soon became a definite part of the group. In 2001, Opera Magna, found bassist: Alejandro Penella. The next to be part of the group was vocalist Pablo Solano (currently in Dragonfly), a friend of Asensi's at the time.

With this formation, Opera Magna recorded a demo with three songs: Horizons of Glory, Lands of Torment and Blood of the Enemy, they were later included on the <a href="El%20%C3%9Altimo%20Caballero">El Último Caballero</a> album. At the end of 2004, Jose Vicente Broseta replaced Pablo on vocals, with whom they recorded their first album El Último Caballero, that was released in 2006. After the recording of the album, Fernando Asensi left the band but remained as sound technician. Adrián Romero replaced him as drummer. Rubén Casas entered as keyboardist of Opera Magna, completing thus the formation that the group remains.

In June 2009 the band released an EP A Dream In A Dream, which contained the songs: A Dream In A Dream, Premature Burial, <a href="Tom%C3%A1s%20de%20Torquemada">Torquemada</a> (<a href="Avalanch">Avalanch</a> cover), among others. They were eventually included on the 2010 album <a href="Poe%20%28Opera%20Magna%20Album%29">Poe</a>.

Recent Years.
On March 31, 2010, the second studio album, Poe was released. The theme of this album revolves around the stories of the American writer. Each song, except the last one, is a representation of one of them. This album has the guest voices of the actor Luis Posada (known for being one of the most reputed dubbing voices in Spain, among which are actors like <a href="Jim%20Carrey">Jim Carrey</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a> or <a href="Leonardo%20Di%20Caprio">Leonardo Di Caprio</a>) in the narration of the intro, Theater actress and musical <a href="Julia%20M%C3%B6ller">Julia Möller</a> in the song "The Oval Portrait", and the lead singer of the death metal band Acriter in the song "The Devil of Perversity".

On 23 June 2017, the band announced they would tour in support of the <a href="Of%20Love%20and%20Other%20Demons%20-%20Act%20II">Of Love and Other Demons - Act II</a> <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> visting <a href="Guadalajara">Guadalajara</a> and <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.

Vera Brown Starr

Vera Brown Starr (May 23, 1924-March 4, 1985) was the first woman elected as chair of the <a href="Yavapai-Apache%20Nation">Yavapai-Apache Nation</a> and served two years in the office, as well as serving over fifteen years on the council. She was one of the delegates to the <a href="1977%20National%20Women%27s%20Conference">1977 National Women's Conference</a>, a major U.S. women's conference held in conjunction with the <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Year">International Women's Year</a> celebrations of the United Nations. In 2012, her name was inscribed on an arch recognizing women who were Native American leaders at the <a href="University%20of%20Arizona">University of Arizona</a>.

Early life.
Vera Brown was born on May 23, 1924 at the Indian Reservation of <a href="Camp%20Verde%2C%20Arizona">Camp Verde, Arizona</a> to Mary and Sam Brown, members of the Mojave-<a href="Apache">Apache</a>. She was the youngest of three siblings. Her father was a miner, working in the United Verde Mine near <a href="Jerome%2C%20Arizona">Jerome, Arizona</a> and the smelters in <a href="Clarkdale%2C%20Arizona">Clarkdale</a> and <a href="Clemenceau%2C%20Arizona">Clemenceau</a>. Until she was school age, the family lived in a "<a href="wickiup">wickiup</a>" near Clarkdale. She attended the segregated public school in Clarkdale, which allowed whites to attend in the mornings and <a href="Hispanic">Hispanic</a>s and <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indians</a> to attend afternoon classes and though she was placed in the morning session, she remembered experiencing discrimination and did not speak English. When she was eleven, her father died on April 19, 1935, from <a href="silicosis">silicosis</a>, having worked the mines without any protective respiratory equipment. She was sent to the <a href="Valentine%20Indian%20School">Valentine Indian School</a> under the <a href="American%20Indian%20boarding%20schools">American Indian boarding school program</a> and graduated from the Indian High School in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>. Though she earned a scholarship to the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Mexico">University of New Mexico</a>, Brown returned to Carkdale to care for her mother because the pension her father earned had ended after one year and her mother was denied social security. 

After World War II, Brown married Antonio L. Moreno (1924-1968), a veteran and miner, from Clarkdale. The couple originally made their home in Jerome, where their children Anthony Jr. (1948-2009) and Petra (1949-2011) were born. In 1949, they moved to <a href="Ajo%2C%20Arizona">Ajo</a>, where Antonio worked at the <a href="Phelps%20Dodge">Phelps-Dodge smelter</a>. 

Tribral council career.
In 1967, against her mother's recommendation, Moreno decided to run for a seat on the tribal council of the <a href="Yavapai-Apache%20Nation">Yavapai-Apache Nation</a>. After her husband's death in 1968, Moreno remarried with Henry Starr. She was successful in attaining a seat in 1969 and served for six years, before becoming the first woman to serve as the Tribal Chair in 1975. After serving two-years as Tribal Chair, the 1977 election was fraught with factionalism, causing a contested election, a court battle, and finally a new vote. Starr did not win her re-election bid as Chair. 

Starr joined the <a href="North%20American%20Indian%20Women%27s%20Association">North American Indian Women's Association</a> (NAIWA), an organization formed to foster inter-tribal betterment for Native Americans. In 1977, she attended the <a href="1977%20National%20Women%27s%20Conference">National Women's Conference</a>, which was held in conjunction with the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>' <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Year">International Women's Year</a> celebrations. As one of Arizona's four Native American delegates, of specific interest to her were the anti-discrimination resolution passed by the women which addressed minority rights, including the removal of American Indian children from their homes and tribes, as well as the discussion of the failure of Arizona to pass <a href="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> legislation to provide health care to low-income families.

Though defeated in her bid for re-election to the chair, Starr continued to serve on the council, being returned in 1978 as a council member. In 1981, she was elected as treasurer of the tribe and held that post until her election as vice chair of the tribe in 1982. She returned as vice chair in 1983. Issues on which she focused during her time on the council were those that would improve the lives of tribe members. She advocated for improved housing, health care initiatives, and protection of water rights.

Death and legacy.
Starr died on March 4, 1985 in <a href="Cottonwood%2C%20Arizona">Cottonwood, Arizona</a> at the Marcus J. Lawrence Memorial Hospital. Posthumously, her name was inscribed in 2011 on the Native American Women of Arizona Arch on the <a href="University%20of%20Arizona">University of Arizona</a> campus, after having been selected to represent their tribe by the Yavapai-Apache Nation.

Labor Congress of Liberia

The Labor Congress of Liberia (abbreviated LCL) was a <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> centre in <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>. 

1951 foundation and 1954 re-foundation.
LCL was founded as the first trade union centre in the country in 1951, but the organization soon became defunct. LCL was re-founded in February 1954. Leroy Francis, a West Indian, played a leading role in the refoundation of LCL. As of mid-1955 LCL had five affiliates: the General Workers' Union, the Dock Workers' Union, the Mine Workers' Union, the Railroad Workers' Union, and the Rubber Workers' Union. LCL claimed to have 50,000 members, although more conservative estimates put the number of due-paying members at around 1,000. Outside of Monrovia LCL established branches at <a href="Greenville">Greenville</a>, <a href="Sinoe%20County">Sinoe County</a> and <a href="Bomi%20Hills">Bomi Hills</a>.

1955 strikes.
In 1955 the LCL-affiliated GWU organized a strike of road construction workers, demanding increase in wages. Negotiations lasted for 8 weeks. The Liberian government took part in facilitating negotiations with the road construction company. Another 1955 strike, a strike at the Bomi Hills Mining Company, was put down by military police and the union leaders were jailed and LCL went defunct.

1958 re-foundation.
LCL was once again re-founded in 1958 by T. Dupigny-Leigh (Social Secretary in the Liberian government). Like the previous <a href="Labor%20Union%20of%20Liberia">Labor Union of Liberia</a>, LCL under Dupigny-Leigh was backed up by the Liberian government. LCL was led by <a href="William%20V.S.%20Tubman%2C%20Jr.">William V.S. Tubman, Jr.</a>, the son of the Liberian president <a href="William%20Tubman">William Tubman</a>. Union fees of LCL went directly to the governming <a href="True%20Whig%20Party">True Whig Party</a>. LCL was affiliated to <a href="ICFTU">ICFTU</a>.

1959 split.
In 1959 LCL underwent a split, and the break-away <a href="Congress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations%20of%20Liberia">Congress of Industrial Organizations</a>. The split begun when the independent-minded Monrovia mechanics union moved away from the pro-government LCL. LCL was divided into the Leigh group (favoring close relations with the government) and the McGill group (favoring independent unions).

Later period.
LCL became largely defunct after the split. CIO overtook the membership in ICFTU. As of 1964 LCL was estimated to have around 1,000 members. As of the mid-1960s LCL reportedly had only one affiliated union, maintaining a presence amongst dock workers.

In 1977 President <a href="William%20R.%20Tolbert%20Jr.">William R. Tolbert Jr.</a> urged the different trade union centres to unite into a single body. The <a href="Liberian%20Federation%20of%20Trade%20Unions">Liberian Federation of Trade Unions</a> (LFTU) was founded, re-uniting LCL and CIO re-united.

Etiology.
"BWS is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, caused by a heterozygous mutation in one of the 2 genes coding for ubiquitously expressed actins: ACTB, located to 7p22-p12 (BRWS1) and ACTG1 on 17q25.3 (BRWS2). All mutations are missense and probably act by a gain of function mechanism, as deletions of the same genes do not result in BWS phenotype."

Martu Wangka

Martu Wangka is an Australian <a href="aboriginal%20language">aboriginal language</a> that has emerged in recent times as several indigenous <a href="indigenous%20Australian">indigenous</a> communities shifted from their respective tribal territories to form a single community.

History.
Martu Wangka developed after two tribes, the <a href="Kartudjara">Kartudjara</a> and the <a href="Manjiljarra">Manjiljarra</a> came in from the Western desert to settle into <a href="Jigalong">Jigalong</a> during the 1960s. Though tribally distinct, they spoke two mutually intelligible dialects of the <a href="Western%20Desert%20language">Western Desert language family</a>. Through daily cohabitation, they developed what is technically known as a <a href="Linkage%20%28linguistics%29">"communalect"</a>. In this process, elements of the two languages are slected to fuse into a single shared idiom, thus forming a <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> distinct from the originative dialects of the various groups who settled down to live together.

As other tribal groups drifted in to join the new community, several other constituent dialects added to the process of formation. These include also Puditara, Wangkajunga, and Yulparitja.

Recent studies.
Martu Wangka developed rapidly, permitting James Marsh to write a dictionary of the language within two decades, consisting of over 400 pages, and which was published in 1992.

Ophelia and the Marvelous Boy

Ophelia and the Marvelous Boy is a 2014 middle-grade fantasy novel by Australian author <a href="Karen%20Foxlee">Karen Foxlee</a>. The novel is a loose retelling of the <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a> story "<a href="The%20Snow%20Queen">The Snow Queen</a>."

Plot.
Ophelia Jane Worthington-Whittard is a scientifically-minded English girl whose mother has recently died. Ophelia's father, an international sword expert, has temporarily moved Ophelia and her older sister Alice to an unnamed northern European city where he is curating an important museum exhibit. The head curator at the museum is Miss Kaminski, a beautiful woman with blonde hair who often wears white clothing. However, she is cold and unkind to Ophelia. 

While her father is working on the exhibit, Ophelia is mostly left alone to wander through the mysterious old museum. One day, she finds a small room with a faded mural of a boy with a sword, captioned "The Marvelous Boy." Hidden in the mural is a small door and when Ophelia peers through the keyhole, she discovers that someone is looking back at her from the other side of the door. The boy on the other side of the door tells Ophelia that he was sent from another world, centuries ago, to defeat the Snow Queen, but that she imprisoned him, instead. The boy's name was taken from him by a group of wizards so that it could not be used against him and he was put under a spell of protection that magically extended his life, but the spell is about to wear off and the Snow Queen will be able to kill him when it does.

The boy tells Ophelia that she must complete a number of tasks, including finding the key that unlocks his door and finding a sword that can kill the Snow Queen. Ophelia sets out to complete these tasks without being caught by Miss Kaminski or the museum guards. As she begins to complete the tasks, she hears her dead mother's voice offering her advice and encouragement. Meanwhile, Alice begins to admire Miss Kaminski's beauty and fashion sense and begins dressing and acting more like her.

Ophelia discovers that Miss Kaminski is the actually Snow Queen in disguise. She intends to kill Alice and turn her into a ghost in order to feed off her strength. Ophelia finds the key to the boy's door, but discovers that he is partly transparent and in danger of disappearing, entirely. She finds the sword and kills the Snow Queen. The boy tells Ophelia that he is going to return to land and the town where he grew up and he fades away, his mission completed. Ophelia, her father, and her sister return home.

Major themes.
Navigating loss and grief are major themes in this novel, with Ophelia having lost her mother and the boy having lost everything he ever knew, including his name. On the subject, Foxlee has said "Grief is devastating, but it can also give you the chance to change your destiny."

Background.
This story began with the idea of a boy imprisoned in a museum. The characters of Ophelia and the Snow Queen were added to the story later. Foxlee had grown up listening to Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales as a child and she was fascinated by the Snow Queen as a villain. She also felt a connection to the Nordic setting of the original fairy tale because her grandparents had emigrated from Finland to Australia. The museum in the novel was inspired by many different museums, including the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Museum</a> in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Reception.
"Ophelia and the Magical Boy" received starred reviews in "Kirkus Reviews," "Publishers Weekly," "Booklist," "The Bulletin," and "School Library Journal." "Publishers Weekly" described the writing as "elegant and accessible, with a pervading melancholy." "Kirkus Reviews" called the novel "A well-wrought, poignant and original reworking of Andersen's 'The Snow Queen.'" It was also included on the "Best Books of 2014" lists from "Publishers Weekly" and "School Library Journal," and on the "Best Children's Books of 2014" list from the "Wall Street Journal."

Mira Lloyd Dock and the Progressive Era Conservation Movement

Mira Lloyd Dock and the Progressive Era Conservation Movement is a biography of a <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> environmentalist and conservationist, written by <a href="Susan%20Rimby">Susan Rimby</a>.

Overview.
Historian Susan Rimby, who holds a Ph.D. in United States history from the <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a>, began researching the book in 2001 while serving as Scholar-in-Residency at the Pennsylvania State Archives. <a href="Shippensburg%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania">Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania</a>'s Center for Faculty Excellence in Scholarship and Teaching assisted her research travels for this book with two grants. Rimby is currently a Founding Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Education at <a href="Lock%20Haven%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania">Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania</a>. 

Mira Lloyd Dock (1853–1945) was at the forefront of the <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressive Era</a> environmental and conservation movement, and in 1901 became the first woman to serve on the Pennsylvania Forest Commission or any public forest commission. Rimby begins by stating her case on why Dock's story is relevant, framed against the background of late 19th century and early 20th century emergence of civic activism in the fields of conservation and ecology. As Dock began to receive public and institutional support for her hortuculture lectures, she was elected to represent Pennsylvania at the International Congress of Women to be held that summer in London. The author weaves Dock's accomplishments around her eagerness to constantly ingest more knowledge, such as her month-long tour of Germany's forests made possible by botanist <a href="Dietrich%20Brandis">Dietrich Brandis</a>. Rimby follows Dock's decades-long career toward the conclusion of Dock's legacies that remain today.

Reception.
Kevin C. Armitage of Miami University of Ohio, in reviewing the book for the "Ohio Valley History" journal, noted that Rimby meticulously provided an historical framework for Dock's life that made the connection between women's suffrage, civic activism and environmental conservation. He stated that the book should inspire more scholarly output on gender's role in environmental activism. 
The <a href="H-Net">H-Net</a> review by Jessica DeWitt noted that the book was light-weight on documenting the <a href="conservation%20movement">conservation movement</a>. But otherwise, DeWitt wrote that the book's strengths were in presenting Dock's story well-framed within the historical, environmental and social times in which she lived.

<a href="Goodreads">Goodreads</a> gave the book four stars out of five, and said the book created a "a vivid and accessible picture of Progressive Era conservation in the eastern United States and Dock's important role and legacy in that movement."

Betty Onuh of the <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>n magazine "<a href="Newswatch%20%28Nigeria%29">Newswatch</a>" stated "Essentially, it is a story "written and directed by Africans and for Africans.""

Creation and filming.
Guinness Nigeria Plc created and financed the film; the company did not reveal the budget. Bob Mahoney, a British man, served as the film's producer. It was filmed in <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, and <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.

According to the producers, the goal was entertainment and there were no plans to show realism. Mahoney stated "We made a conscious effort at points in the script to get back out there and show Africa".

According to Guinness Nigeria corporate department director Tunde Savage, the film was made to promote universal access to clean water and not for profit reasons.


Cast.
Other actors included Nigerians <a href="Buki%20Ajayi">Buki Ajayi</a> and <a href="Richard%20Mofe-Damijo">Richard Mofe-Damijo</a>.

Reception.
According to Foster the film felt "at times,[...]like a promotional film for the African tourist board", without poverty and blight that were common in sub-Saharan Africa. She stated that an audience in Cameroon had a positive reception to the film because it showed Cameroonian landmarks.

"<a href="P.M.%20News">Tempo</a>" stated that "Overall, it is a good starting point for Guinness in its effort to contribute its quota in building the film industry in Nigeria." The paper stated that "Lovely as the intentions behind the production of this movie might be, it lacks much of its Pan African toga" since the clothing featured in the film was not African and that "From the 3-minutes clip which was shown to select journalists, it is obvious that the movie lacks the African stuff which it intends to promote."

The family descend from Moharram from Judham (<a href="Judham">Jutham</a>) ibn Uday ibn Hareth of <a href="Al%20Murrah">Murrah</a> ibn Adad ibn Yashjob ibn Oreib ibn Zeid of <a href="Kahlan">Kahlan</a> of <a href="Sheba">Sheba</a> (Sabaa') of Yashgiob of Yareeb from <a href="Qahtanite">Qahtan</a> from the <a href="Arab%20peninsula">Arab peninsula</a>. (Arabic: بنو جذام (عمرو) بن عدي بن الحارث بن مرة بن أدد بن زيد بن يشجب بن عريب بن زيد بن كهلان بن سبأ بن يشجب بن يعرب بن قحطان.) 

From <a href="Judham">Judham</a> are the dynasty <a href="%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%88%20%D9%87%D9%88%D8%AF">Hud</a> <a href="Banu%20Hud">(Banu Hud)</a> and the dynasty <a href="https%3A//ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D8%25A8%25D9%2586%25D9%2588_%25D9%2585%25D8%25B1%25D8%25AF%25D9%2586%25D9%258A%25D8%25B4">Martinez</a> who ruled <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> and <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>.

Eight Album (Muse album)

Previous Album: <a href="Drones%20%28Muse%20album%29">Drones</a> (2015)

New Info:

The first time when Muse began to speak about this album was in September 2015. According to Dom, they were discussing the direction for the new album and that this album must be really different from the other releases. Dom also said: «I think it's time to kind of lose our minds a little bit more in the studio and delve into some new areas of music that we're kind of not that used to or comfortable with. I think we should definitely do that and kinda go for it. Yeah, we've got small ideas about how we think we can evolve. That's the key thing: evolving.»

In one of the recent interviews Dom said that <a href="Drones%20%28album%29">Drones</a> might've been their last album. As he said «The world is a very different place. And the way people consume music is very different than it used to be. So we’ve been talking about just releasing small groups of tracks, or just singles, for quite a number of years now.»

Matt Bellamy mentioned in a recent interview for Virgin Radio France that they might start recording and working on new material by the end of the current year. He also mentioned that they might use more electronic elements or orchestral elements and take the experimental approach again for new material, as opposed to their recent <a href="Drones%20%28album%29">recent album</a>'s more basic approach (using guitar, bass and drums).

At the 2016 Q awards, Bellamy said that they might release a song or two in 2017 but it's unlikely that a new album would come out that year, more likely in 2018.

During 2017, both Bellamy and Howard posted several posts of themselves working in the studio as well as Dom liking some Instagram comments posted by fans, pointing out to new material, suggesting that they are probably working on new material. After a fan met both the band and <a href="Tommaso%20Colliva">Tommaso Colliva</a> outside <a href="Air%20Studios">Air Studios</a>, he cited them saying that they have recorded 3 new songs, one of which is presumably going to be a heavier song.

On May 18th, 2017, Muse released a new song called <a href="Dig%20Down%20%28song%29">Dig Down</a>, that they confirmed would be on the next album. It is probably not one of the original three songs recorded in March, as Dig Down was written in early April 2017.

Reception.
This game was well-received as IGN.com said, "You need guts to go head-to-head with a Microsoft title, and Motocross Mania has more than enough.". They awarded the game a score of 8.0 (Great).

GameSpot was divided between the two releases. On one hand, they were thrilled to award the PC version of the game a score of 7.7 (good) stating, "If you're a fan of motocross, then Motocross Mania would make a great addition to your collection." However, when it came to the PS version, they scathingly remarked that "With so many better supercross games on the market, many of them older and available at similar bargain-basement price points, Motocross Mania has no place in the market." The PS version was not well received by the staff and it was given a score of 2.1 (terrible).

Charles P. Whittemore and William E. Platner platted Ash Park on the former Reuben Ash farm on August 17, 1893. Platner operated the local stone quarry, and many of the house foundations are made of stone and are a reminder of his role in developing the neighborhood. The <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a> was a setback for the developers, but by 1895 the local economy had recovered enough that lots began to sell. Thirty-six of the 42 houses in the district were built between 1895 and 1919. Construction was sporadic until the 1960s, with the last five houses built after that. The district also represents Mount Vernon's railroad-related prosperity, as most of the houses are from this era and remain relatively unchanged. They exemplify the popular architectural styles of the era, especially the various <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> and revival styles in vogue at the time.

2007 Euro Beach Soccer League – Last chance bracket

The 2007 Euro Beach Soccer League – Last chance bracket, simply known as the "Last chance bracket" was an additional round of the <a href="2007%20Euro%20Beach%20Soccer%20League">2007 Euro Beach Soccer League</a> (EBSL) that was specially organised to determine the fifth and final European nation that would qualify for the <a href="2007%20FIFA%20Beach%20Soccer%20World%20Cup">2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup</a>. The event was organised by <a href="Beach%20Soccer%20Worldwide">Beach Soccer Worldwide</a> (BSWW), in parallel with the staging of the the <a href="2007%20Euro%20Beach%20Soccer%20League%23Superfinal">2007 EBSL Superfinal</a>, taking place during the same dates (23–26 August) and in the same location of <a href="Marsielle">Marsielle</a>, <a href="France">France</a>.

Five berths were allocated to European teams in the <a href="2007%20FIFA%20Beach%20Soccer%20World%20Cup">2007 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup</a>, four of which were filled when <a href="Portugal%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Portugal</a>, <a href="Spain%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Spain</a>, <a href="Russia%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Russia</a> and <a href="France%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">France</a> reached the <a href="2007%20Euro%20Beach%20Soccer%20League%23Knockout%20stage">semi-finals of the Superfinal</a>. This meant there was still one final berth at the World Cup to be filled. As in 2006, in order to decide which nation would get this fifth and final spot at the World Cup, BSWW decided the prospective nations would compete in a knockout tournament called the "Last chance bracket", with the winner claiming the final World Cup ticket. 

<a href="Italy%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Italy</a> won the event by beating <a href="Switzerland%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Switzerland</a> in the final and claimed the last remaining World Cup berth.

The last chance bracket was retired from use after this edition due to the establishment of a <a href="FIFA%20Beach%20Soccer%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29">dedicated World Cup qualifying competition for UEFA nations</a> the following year.

Teams.
This round of the 2007 EBSL was a distinctly separate and unique event from the regular structure of the league, but nevertheless related to the league since it involved inviting back teams previously knocked out of World Cup qualifying contention during this year's EBSL to compete in the event for a second chance at qualification, as well as four wild-card entries, as listed below.
These nations were eliminated from the EBSL in the preliminary round

These nations competed in Division A but failed to qualify for the Superfinal

Unusually, their lyrics are exclusively in <a href="Plattdeutsch">Plattdeutsch</a>, a minority <a href="West%20Germanic%20languages">Germanic dialect</a> of northern Germany and the eastern Netherlands.

History.
De fofftig Penns was founded in 2003, purely for fun, by three schoolfriends from , a district of the port city of <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> in north-west Germany. They were Malte Battefeld ("Riemelmeester Malde"), Jakob Köhler ("Kommodige Jaykopp") and Torben Otten ("Plietsche Torbän"). Until near the end of their schooldays, they knew hardly any Plattdeutsch at all. They chose the name as a tongue-in-cheek tribute to American rapper <a href="50%20Cent">50 Cent</a>; their first song was a parody of his song "<a href="P.I.M.P.">P.I.M.P.</a>". They were attracted by the idea of performing in a modern musical genre using a dialect most often associated with their grandparents' generation. Jaykopp has said that their first song was not free of linguistic mistakes, but that after a while they all learned to speak good Plattdeutsch. His grandmother was delighted that they had learned how to chat with their grandparents in their native tongue. Torbän's grandmother has even attended one of the band's more recent concerts; but left rapidly, because it was too loud. The band broke up after its members graduated from school, but reformed in 2007.

They began to perform live in 2009, as a <a href="supporting%20act">supporting act</a> for other bands in northern Germany. In October 2009, they competed as the representatives for Plattdeutsch at <a href="Liet%20International">Liet International</a>, a music competition for the regional and minority languages of Europe, where they placed eighth but attracted favourable critical attention.

In early 2010, they began to tour as a <a href="Headliner%20%28performances%29">headline act</a>. In August and September 2010, they performed live at seven schools in northern Germany, on the invitation of the . Jaykopp said that the band had to get out of bed at the same time as the schoolkids so that they could carry out <a href="soundcheck">soundcheck</a>s at 8 AM - but that when they saw the kids dancing on tables at 10 AM, they knew that the kids were now awake.

The band represented the German <a href="Bremen%20%28state%29">state of Bremen</a> in the <a href="Bundesvision%20Song%20Contest%202013">Bundesvision Song Contest 2013</a> with their song "Löppt" (English: "It Works"), where they placed seventh.

For inspiration, they largely rely on songs by better-known musicians; such as , <a href="Egotronic">Egotronic</a>, <a href="Mediengruppe%20Telekommander">Mediengruppe Telekommander</a>, <a href="Saalschutz">Saalschutz</a> and .

Nordfeld

Nordfeld is a manor house on the island of <a href="M%C3%B8n">Møn</a> in southeastern <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>. The estate was created in 1774 but the current, <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Neo-Gothica</a> main building is from 1876.

History.
All of Møn was up until the second half of the 18thj century crown land. Nordfeld is one of many manor houses in eastern Denmark that was created when Frederick V and then Christian VII began to sell off crown land as part of the agricultural reforms of the time. The intension was to sell the land to the local tenant farmers but count Holck and Thygesen who were put in charge of the sale were opposed to the reforms. They divided Møn into give large estates which were sold in auctuin in 1770. The ihe local farmers showed up in large numbers at the auction to buy the entire island but only managed to buy three of the estates due to a requirement that <a href="guarantee">guarantee</a>s for the payment should be provided the following morning at 10 am at the latest. Nordfeld was therefore not sold until a new auction was held in March 1774. After <a href="Johan%20Friedrich%20Struense">Johan Friedrich Struense</a>'s progressive government had been replaced by a more conservative one, it was no longer possible for farmers to buy manors and Nordfeld was instead acquired by <a href="J%C3%B8rgen%20Wichfeld%20%281729%E2%80%931797%29">Jørgen Wichfeld</a>. He immediately constructed a new manor house on the land.
In 1787, Wichfeld sold Nordfeld to Peder Sølling. He sold many of the farms to the tenant farmers before selling Nordfeld to <a href="Christopher%20Sch%C3%B8ller%20B%C3%BClow">Christopher Schøller Bülow</a> in 1806. He already owned several other manor houses and had embarked on a promising career as civil servant but experienced economic difficulties during the agricultural crisis of the 1810s and went bankrupt in 1820. He fled the country after being indicted for embezzlement with public funds and was sentenced to prison in 1821. Nordfeld was sold to Christian Danneskiold-Samsøe. In 1823, he passed it on to his youngest son, <a href="Otto%20Danneskiold-Sams%C3%B8e">Otto Danneskiold-Samsøe</a>, who was director of the Royal Danish Mail Services. He constructed a new main building.

After Otto Danneskiold-Samsøe's death in 1894, Nordfeld was passed on to his son <a href="Christian%20Conrad%20Sophus%20Danneskiold-Sams%C3%B8e%20%281836-1908%29">Christian Conrad Sophus Danneskiold-Samsøe</a> wgo became known as the "theatre count" after being appointed to director of the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Theatre">Royal Danish Theatre</a> later that samee year. After his death in 1908, Nordfeld was passed on first to his widow Wanda Danneskiold-Samsøe and then his son Viggo Danneskiold-Samsøe who became the last member of the family to own the estate.

Architecture.
The current main building was built by Frederik Wilsbech for Otto Danneskjold-Samsøe in 1774–76. It is a one-storey red brick building in <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> style with <a href="Crow-stepped%20gable">Crow-stepped gable</a>]s. On each side of the building is a three-bay central projection tipped by a Crow-stepped gable. The central projection on the front side contains the main entrance while the one on the rear side features as large ceranda overlooking the garden. The central projection is flanked by two crow-stepped gable dormers on both sides of the building.

Ro the south of the main building is a complex of farm buildings (Avlsgården=. It consists of four one-storey buildings in red brick with details in yellow brick and red-painted timber, arched windows and tin roofs.

Forvalterboligen (the manager's house) is a one-storey red brick building on a stone foundation. It has a red tile roof with three chimneys. 

The stables (Herskabsstalden) is also a one-storey brick building. It has a slate roof. A tall gabled dormer opens to the jayloft. A brick cornice runs below the roof.

A total of 11 individual buildings have been listed. They include the main building, the four-winged complex of farm buildings, the farm manager's house with Herskabsstalden and an outbuilding and the gardener's house with another outbuilding.

Social thriller

A social thriller is a <a href="motion%20picture">motion picture</a> genre using elements of <a href="suspense">suspense</a> to augment attention to abuses of power and instances of oppression in society. The genre gained cache in 2017 with the release of <a href="Jordan%20Peele">Jordan Peele</a>'s "<a href="Get%20Out%20%28film%29">Get Out</a>", a film about <a href="racial%20microaggression">racial microaggression</a>s that veil a conspiracy to abduct young African-Americans and possess their bodies. Prior to Peele, other film actors, directors and critics had used the term to describe an emerging genre of cinema with examples from all over the globe.

Retrospective usage.
"Social thriller" (often appearing in quotes) was being used as early as the 1970s to <a href="retrospective">retrospective</a>ly describe political <a href="neo-noir">neo-noir</a> cinema. An early example comes from cinema writer <a href="Georges%20Sadoul">Georges Sadoul</a>'s characterization of "<a href="The%20Monster%20%281954%20film%29">El Whsh</a>" ("The Monster"), an <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian <a href="crime%20film">crime film</a> entered into the 1954 <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. Sadoul sums up the film as "a social thriller based on an authentic police case about police pursuit of a drug-addicted gangster." Sadoul goes on to describe the film's documnetary style and backdrop of life in the Egyptian countryside. Other early uses of the term can be found in depictions of <a href="French%20New%20Wave">French New Wave</a> films, such as "<a href="Nada%20%281974%20film%29">The Nada Gang</a>", <a href="Claude%20Chabrol">Claude Chabrol</a>'s 1974 film Inspired by the <a href="May%201968%20events%20in%20France">May 1968 events in France</a>. In their book, "French Culture Since 1945", Malcolm and Martin Cook wrote that "Chabrol's career has been almost exclusively devoted to what might be called the 'social thriller'—films using a <a href="suspense%20film">suspense</a> format often akin to that of <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a> to comment on the deviousness and duplicity of French society." 

Many other film critics bandied about the term in their reviews prior to the 2010s but seldom in a way that gave the social thriller its own status as a codified genre in cinema. Prior to 2017, most writers used the term only once, in a single review, and to characterize an individual film. In his biography on <a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a>, <a href="Axel%20Madsen">Axel Madsen</a> calls the 1937 <a href="Humphrey%20Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> picture "<a href="Dead%20End%20%281937%20film%29">Dead End</a>" a social thriller. TLA Video reviewer David Bleiler described the 1950 <a href="Sidney%20Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a> film "<a href="No%20Way%20Out%20%281950%20film%29">No Way Out</a>" as "an exceptionally made, tense drama which succeeds both as medical soap opera and social thriller." Douglas Brode called <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> "the alienated anti-hero of the social thriller" for his 1955 performance in "<a href="Bad%20Day%20at%20Black%20Rock">Bad Day at Black Rock</a>". Another Poitier film, 1967's "<a href="In%20the%20Heat%20of%20the%20Night%20%28film%29">In the Heat of the Night</a>", got tagged as social thriller by Leonard Martin. Both Tracy and Poitier also appeared in 1967's "[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner", a film that would later be identified as key "non-thriller" social thriller.

For films produced outside the U.S., more than one reviewer has named the 1961 British film "[[Victim (1961 film)|Victim]]" as a social thriller, having been the first [[English language]] film on record to use the word [[homosexual]] and made in the [[United Kingdom]] when homosexuality was persecuted as a crime. Ismal Xavier called the 1962 Brazilian train robbery film "O Assalto ao Trem Pagador" a social thriller. [[Taiwan]]ese director Bai Jingrui's 1982 film "Offend the Law of God" has been called "an exploitation social thriller" and the 1996 [[Spain|Spanish]] film [[Taxi (1996 film)|Taxi]], about the rise of the rascist right wing, has also been given the label. In his "Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Cinema", author Peter Rollberg goes a bit further than the one-mention references of his peers. In describing the work of Russo-[[Belarus]]ian director [[Aleksandr Faintsimmer]], Rolling writes, "Fainsimmer devoted himself to the traditionally underrepresented genre of the social thriller with blockbusters such as "No Right to Fail" (1974) and "[[The Tavern on Pyatnitskaya|The Cafeteria on Piatnikskaia Street]]" (1978)." Rollberg also names [[Leonid Filatov]]'s 1982 film "The Rooks" and Vadim Derbenev's 1985 hit "The Snake Catcher" as landmarks of the genre in the [[Soviet Union]].

Early 21st century western cinema.
At the onset of the 2000s, critics and scholars continued to label a number of contemporary films as social thrillers. The authors of "Sociology: An Introductory Textbook and Reader" wrote of the 2002 British film "[[Dirty Pretty Things (film)|Dirty Pretty Things]]" as being "not a documentary but a social thriller which blends aspects of the global urban legends about child kidnapping for organs and prostitutes drugging unsuspecting barflies who wake up in a hotel bathtub minus a kidney." "[[The New New Yorker]]" echoed theis sentiment, saying, ""Dirty Pretty Things" is not a violent thriller. It might be called a social thriller—a creepy, tightly knit suspense film that, on the fly, reveals more about the lives of immigrants in London than the most scrupulously earnest documentary." Other films labeled as social thrillers from the first decade-and-a-half of the new millennium include 2005's British production of "[[The Constant Gardener (film)|The Constant Gardener]]" and
the 2008 Italian film "[[As God Commands]]", both based on the best-selling novels of the same names. The "[[Wall Street Journal]]" called 2011's "[[The Social Network]]" "Part [[Motaloty play]], part social thriller," the French film festival hit "Corporate" was called a socail thriller ib 2016.

Modern Indian cinema.
Like the West, Indian cinema has a longstanding tradition of identifying some movies as "[[social film]]s" as "[[social problem film]]s", genres that emerged when [[talking pictures]] came to India in the 1930s. The rise of "social thriller" as a genre garnered familiarity in India, as it did in the U.S., in its association with a box office hit. 2016's "[[Pink (2016 film)|Pink]]", a [[courtroom drama]] that deals with [[rape]], was India's biggest box office success to date, starred longtime [[Bollywood]] icon [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who named the film a social thriller. Bachchan said of "Pink" that, "the context and the premise of the film shall always be of prime interest," but that "much is not spelt out because of the nature of the story and, of course, the nature of its genre—a social thriller!”

Before "Pink" the term social thriller was applied occasionally by Bollywood's directors and marketers and then repeated by the press to describe selected movies, such as 2014's film "[[Fugly (film)|Fugly]]" starring [[olympic boxing]] medalist [[Vijender Singh]]. Prior to "Fugly"'s release, the press were unfamiliar with the genre, and in a film preview the "[[India Times]]" said that it was "the movie that's been billed as a 'social thriller' (whatever that is)." After "Fugly", other social thriller tags followed suit, such as 2014's "[[Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain]]" about the [[Union Carbide Disaster]], and 2015's "Yeh Lall Rang" about the [[mafia]] trafficking in [[human blood]]. 

[[South India]]n film columnists may have been using the term prior to their [[North India]]n counterparts. [[G. Dhananjayan]] called the 2009 [[Tamil language]] film "[[Achchamundu! Achchamundu!]]" ("There is fear! There is fear!") a social thriller, citing it as "one of the rare mainstream Tamil films with the subject on [[pedophile]]s." Tamil director Bramma G. called his 2014 debut film "Kutram Kaditha]", The same year Jean Marcose called his 2014 [[Malayalam]] film "[[Angels (2014 film)|Angels]]" a social thriller, Film Beat's" Akhila Menon used the term to describe both "[[Puthiya Niyamam]]" and "[[Evidam Swargamanu]]" in 2015. Other Tamil soical thrillers include 2016's '[[Kabali]]", and "Aagam". Director Vijay Anand Sriram said, ""Aagam" has a message but it will not be preachy. It’s a social thriller with commercial elements in it,”

"Get Out" and after.
Broadly categorized as a [[horror film]], director Jordan Peele stated that his directorial debut, "[[Get Out]]", was part of a lineage of social thrillers, meaning that whatever scary things manifest onscreen, society is actually the true evil. Peele told the "[[New York Times]]" that social thrillers “all deal with this human monster, this societal monster. And the villain is us.” To coincide with the release of "Get Out", Peele curated a film series for the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM) called "The Art of the Social Thriller." The series featured classic horror films like "[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]", "[[Night of the Living Dead]]", "[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]", "[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]", "[[Candyman (film)|Candyman]]", "[[The People Under the Stairs]]", and the first film of [[Wes Craven]]'s "[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]" series. Peele also included films outside of the horror genre, such as [[psychological thrillers]] "[[Funny Games (1997 film)|Funny Games]]" and "[[Misery (film)|Misery]]", [[Hitchcock]]'s [[mystery film|mystery thriller]] "[[Rear Window]]", and comedy-thriller "[[The 'Burbs]]". The [[sneak preview]] of "Get Out" was preceded by the 1967 [[comedy-drama]] "[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]", the first Hollywood film to address interracial marriage and a big influence on the premise for 'Peele's own film. When asked about its inclusion in the series, Peele told the "[[Village Voice]]", "It’s not an actual thriller, it’s just a great exploration of the social phenomenon of how we deal with race, putting it in a package that everyone can understand. Anybody can relate to the fear of meeting your potential in-laws for the first time... "At a certain point with "Get Out", I realized that I was making a sort of thriller take on "Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner"."

After "Get Out"'s success, Peele announced that he had plans to make four more social thrillers in the next decade. In an interview with "Business Insider" he said, "The best and scariest monsters in the world are human beings and what we are capable of especially when we get together. I've been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact, and each one of my movies is going to be about a different one of these social demons." 

By mid-2017 the press started touted upcoming films as belonging to the genre, including [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] favorites like [[Colombia]]'s "Matar a Jesús", and Frence's "L'Atelier"; Brazil's "Rifle", the remake of [[Argentina]]'s "La Patota", the [[social media]] scandal movie "Assassination Nation" [[James Gunn]]'s "[[The Belko Experiment]]", animated film "Tales of the Hedgehog" and [[Stephen King]]'s "[[The Dark Tower (2017 film)|The Dark Tower]]".

Criticism.
Use of the term social thriller has come under scrutiny since its widened use. One critique is that niche genre films that achieve wider success than that of a genre's fanbase are re-categorized to make them more palatable. In a news piece about 2017's most successful horror films, journalist Haleigh Foutch wrote that ""Get Out" is being billed as a 'social thriller' now that the film has dominated at the box office and conjured early awards buzz."

If they want to talk, they should be out there talking about issues relating to them. Why are their demands the same as the <a href="Pan-Blue%20coalition">pro-blue camp's</a>?" In 2006, she voiced opposition to revisions of the National Pension Draft Law, stating that pensions should be collect based on a person's ability to work, not the severity of their disability. Later that year, she blamed legislator <a href="Lin%20Yi-shih">Lin Yi-shih</a> for stripping funding from the community healthcare system, which caused many hospitals' developmental delay assessment units to close. 

Political career.
In 2007, Chen was ranked first on the <a href="Democratic%20Progressive%20Party">Democratic Progressive Party</a> list and subsequently won election to the <a href="Legislative%20Yuan">Legislative Yuan</a>.

In April 2008, Chen opposed an amendment to the Statute Governing Public Welfare Lotteries that reclassified sports lotteries as a subset of public welfare lotteries while mandating that eighty percent of the funds raised be earmarked for sports, and twenty percent for social welfare initiatives. Chen stated in December 2008 while discussing revisions to the Assembly and Parade Act that she preferred notice of a gathering be given to law enforcement on a voluntary basis. She expressed support for <a href="Chen%20Shui-bian">Chen Shui-bian</a> in January 2009, while he was imprisoned <a href="Chen%20Shui-bian%20corruption%20charges">on corruption charges</a>. Later that month, Chen Chieh-ju described the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Taiwan%29">Ministry of the Interior</a> led by <a href="Liao%20Liou-yi">Liao Liou-yi</a> as "the ministry of handing out money...carelessly" after it was reported that vouchers worth NT$11 million had been misplaced. By January 2009, Chen was highly ranked by the Citizen Congress Watch, a watchdog organization. In March, she pushed the <a href="Ma%20Ying-jeou">Ma Ying-jeou</a> administration to extend unemployment benefits to a full year. In April 2009, Chen coauthored an amendment to the Civil Code permitting divorce proceedings to begin via mediation. She later called for legal amendments permitting community members to report cases of child abuse, a responsibility otherwise delegated to police, teachers, medical personnel, and social workers. In September, Chen spoke out against the establishments of casinos in Penghu, disputing the county government's claim that launching a casino operation would help the local economy, providing 25,000 jobs and 5 million visitors annually. 

In 2010, Chen proposed raising compensation for people who had died from the use of a <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus%20subtype%20H1N1">H1N1</a> vaccine developed by Adimmune Corporation to NT$12 million, after the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20%28Taiwan%29">Centers for Disease Control</a> had already announced a raise to NT$6 million from NT$2 million. She expressed reservations about a proposal by the Ministry of the Interior in October that sought to allow absentee voting in Taiwanese elections starting in 2012, believing that the plan had not done enough to ensure against the tampering of ballots. She praised the passage of amendments to the Social Assistance Act in December, stating that the revisions brought Taiwan in line with other regions in considering edibility of low-income households for government subsidies. In March 2011, Chen and fellow legislator <a href="Yu%20Jane-daw">Yu Jane-daw</a> called on the Executive Yuan to suspend mayor <a href="Jason%20Hu">Jason Hu</a> after a fatal fire at ALA Pub in Taichung, which premier <a href="Wu%20Den-yih">Wu Den-yih</a> refused to do. In April, a month after the <a href="Fukushima%20Daiichi%20nuclear%20disaster">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster</a> had occurred, Chen derided the <a href="Red%20Cross%20Society%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China">Red Cross Society of the Republic of China</a> for its hesitation in offering aid, and the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Council">Atomic Energy Council</a> for its technological ability to detect nuclear radiation. Near the end of her first term, Chen proposed an amendment to the Consumer Debt Clearance Act, which sought to simplify the process for debt settlement. She helped pass revisions to the Equalization of Land Rights Act, remarking "Transparency in the real-estate market is the most basic request of consumers" in support of the changes. Chen pushed for the status of people with HIV/AIDS to be registered at the Centers for Disease Control, opposing efforts to list that information directly on national health insurance cards. The Citizen Congress Watch again ranked Chen one of the best lawmakers at the of her first term in office.

In June 2011, the Democratic Progressive Party finalized the list of legislative candidates contesting at large seats. Chen was ranked first for the second consecutive election cycle, and retained her seat on the Legislative Yuan. Shortly after her reelection in January 2012, Chen filed a lawsuit against Hu Wei-jen and Chang Ji-ping, accusing the pair of spying on DPP presidential candidate <a href="Tsai%20Ing-wen">Tsai Ing-wen</a>. Later that year, she objected to a levy raising premiums on national health insurance and criticized an amendment to the Medical Care Act protecting medical professionals from malpractice lawsuits. In 2013, Chen proposed a revision to the Nuclear Reactor Facilities Control Act mandating a local referendum be held wherever a new nuclear plant was to begin operation. She opposed a second bill intended to legal gambling, this time on the outlying island of Matsu. Throughout the year, Chen reported on various medical issues, drawing attention to drugs that were manufactured with misleading authorizations, as well as long-term elder care. In 2014, she backed calls to help the elderly find adequate housing, eventually proposing related revisions to the Senior Citizens’ Welfare Act in 2015. That June, she helped revise the Income Tax Act, turning profits from housing sales into taxable income.

Political stances.
As a lawmaker, Chen continued advocating for the rights of the disabled. In addition, Chen repeatedly denounced the use of excessive force by law enforcement personnel. She has attended multiple rallies commemorating the <a href="1959%20Tibetan%20uprising">1959 Tibetan uprising</a>, and supported calls to extend right of residency to Tibetans married to Taiwanese nationals. In 2009, Chen opposed offering insurance to foreign elder caregivers, fearing that domestic caregivers would lose their jobs. She later rejected a 2011 appeal to extend the duration for which foreign caretakers are permitted to stay in Taiwan, favoring changes to legislation standardizing long-term care instead. In 2015, Chen submitted a motion to the Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee of the Legislative Yuan that would bar rich families from hiring foreign caretakers.

Personal.
Chen's son has developmental and physical disabilities.

Early life.
She was born in <a href="Clarksburgh%2C%20Virginia">Clarksburgh</a>, Virginia on 3 March, 1852. She was of Pennsylvanian stock, in whom the <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> and Baptist blood mingled. Her maiden name was Garard. She was "fondly proud" of the home of her adoption, Iowa. She was left motherless at the age of five and her father was killed in the service of his country a few years later. Left early to struggle with the adverse elements of human life, she developed a strong character and marked individuality, and overcame many difficulties in acquiring an education. In spite of ill health, the discouragement of friends and financial pressure, she maintained her independence and kept herself in school for eight years. She spent two years in the academy in <a href="Washington%2C%20Iowa">Washington, Iowa</a>, three years in the <a href="Iowa%20State%20Industrial%20College">Iowa State Industrial College</a>, and three years in <a href="Hillsdale%20College">Hillsdale College</a>, Michigan. 

Theological training and preaching.
While in the last-named place she completed the English Theological course with several elective studies, having charge of one or two churches all the time and preaching twice every Sunday during the three years. She says: "I never spent much time over the oft controverted question, 'Shall woman preach?' I thought the most satisfactory solution of the problem would be for woman quietly, without ostentation or controversy, to assume her place and let her work speak for itself." After five years of faithful, fruitful service in the <a href="Free%20Baptist%20Church">Free Baptist Church</a>, convictions of truth and duty caused her to sever ties and cast her lot with another church. For eight years she was engaged in the regular pastoral work of the Universalist Church, during which time she was a close and thorough student, keeping well informed on the questions of the day. Never satisfied with present attainments, she pursued a more advanced theological and philosophical course, in which she passed an examination and received the degree of <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Divinity">BD</a> from <a href="Lombard%20University">Lombard University</a>, Illinois.

Glyn interviews the owners about their clientele, then plays the edited video packages for the "South of Wilshire" contestants, who must guess the identify of the star.

August 2017 Quetta suicide bombing

On 12 August 2017, a <a href="suicide%20bombing">suicide bombing</a> took place near a <a href="Pakistan%20army">Pakistan army</a> truck in <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a>, <a href="Balochistan%2C%20Pakistan">Balochistan</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, leaving 15 people dead including 8 soldiers, while injuring 40 others. The <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant%20%E2%80%93%20Khorasan%20Province">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province</a> claimed responsibility for the attack.

Background.
The attack came three days after lawyers in <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a> ended a three-day (7-9 Aug) strike on the first anniversary of <a href="August%202016%20Quetta%20bombing">a suicide attack</a> that killed several lawyers. The attack followed three previous attacks in the city in 2017, on 13 February, on <a href="April%202017%20Quetta%20bombing">21 April</a> and on <a href="June%202017%20Pakistan%20bombings">23 June</a>. The attack came just two days before Pakistan's 71st <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28Pakistan%29">Independence Day</a>.

According to <a href="Dawn%20%28newspaper%29">Dawn</a>, at the end of July a security alert had been issued stating that an explosive-laden vehicle had entered Quetta and an attack could occur in a market or a crowded place.

Bombing.
On the evening of 12 August 2017, a suicide bomber riding on a explosives-rigged motorcycle blew himself up near an on-duty <a href="Pakistan%20army">Pakistan army</a> patrol truck which was passing through Pishin bus stop on the Khojak Road, <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a> in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>'s southwestern province <a href="Balochistan%2C%20Pakistan">Balochistan</a>. 

Since the <a href="Explosive%20belt">suicide vest</a> contained <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiary explosives</a>, several nearby vehicles caught fire. The explosion was so loud that it was heard all across the city and windowpanes of nearby buildings were shattered by the impact of the blast. After collecting forensic evidence, Bomb Disposal Squad's Kabeer Khan said that 20–25 kilograms of explosives were used in the attack. According to the Director-General Civil Defence Aslam Tareen, the explosives were packed with <a href="ball%20bearing">ball bearing</a>s to inflict maximum casualties. At least 15 people including 8 Pakistan army soldiers, were killed while 40 others were injured in the attack. According to Balochistan Home Minister, Sarfaraz Bugti, many bodies were burnt beyond recognition adding that the patrol may have been the target.

The blast occurred near <a href="Ayub%20National%20Stadium">Ayub National Stadium</a> where celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of Pakistan's independence had been under way since 11 August.

Aftermath.
Immediately after the explosion, three <a href="fire%20tender">fire tender</a>s reached the spot and fire fighters engaged in overcoming the fire. Four cars, four auto-rickshaws and two motorcycles were engulfed in flames. The area was cordoned off which is in close proximity of the <a href="Balochistan%20Assembly">Balochistan Assembly</a> and Quetta Law College. Security officials reached the site and started a search operation. The injured were taken to Civil Hospital and Combined Military Hospital in Quetta. The condition of seven injured was declared critical. Following the attack, a state-of-emergency had been imposed in the city and holidays for all doctors in the city were suspended.

A high-level investigation team, comprising three senior police officers had been formed to probe the attack. The Chief of the Army Staff <a href="Qamar%20Bajwa">Qamar Bajwa</a> and Interior Minister <a href="Ahsan%20Iqbal">Ahsan Iqbal</a> attended the <a href="Namaz-e-janaza">funeral prayers</a> of the slain soldiers and also visited the injured at the hospital.

Responsibility.
<a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant%20%E2%80%93%20Khorasan%20Province">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province</a> released a statement claiming the attack, according to the US-based monitoring group SITE.

The family moved to New Zealand in 1894, settling in the <a href="Leith%20Valley">Leith Valley</a> area of <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>. Jeans was educated at <a href="Otago%20Girls%27%20High%20School">Otago Girls' High School</a>.

Stewart Levenson

Stewart I. Levenson is the former Chairman of the Department of Medicine at the VA Medical Center in <a href="Manchester%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Manchester, New Hampshire</a> (2011–2017). Levenson also served as the Medical Director of the VA New England Network, from 2014 to 2017. He retired from these positions in July 2017 in part to avoid retaliation for becoming a whistleblower, exposing dangerous treatment of patients at the Manchester VA. He and W. Edward "Ed" Kois cofounded a group of whistleblowers which eventually grew to over a dozen care givers. The group submitted formal complaints about the Manchester Facility to the Office of Special Counsel depicting substandard care that was being provided to veterans. The group demanded the removal of the medical center's top leadership. These complaints became the basis of a major Boston Globe Spotlight report.

This report detailed deplorable conditions and an obsession with performance metrics at the expense of patient care within New Hampshire's only VA facility. The reaction to the Boston Globe article was swift with the Department of Veteran's Affairs Secretary, David Shulkin ordering a "Top to Bottom" investigation. The medical center's director, Danielle Ocker, and the chief of staff, James Schlosser were immediately removed. Shulkin visited the medical center along with New Hampshire's entire Congressional delegation. Shulkin met privately with Levenson and Kois, along with the other whistleblowers for close to an hour. After the meeting, at the urging of Levenson, he then removed the medical center's nurse executive Carol Williams. An announcement was also made that the medical center would receive $30 million in order to provide improved care.

Shulkin also ordered the creation of a task force to study the feasibility of providing a full service hospital for New Hampshire, one of only two states not to have such a medical center. Skulkin appointed Michael Mayo- Smith to lead this task force. Levenson stated in an interview that this was unacceptable since he had complained to Mayo-Smith for several years regarding the poor quality of care and received little attention. Levenson also expressed his reservations regarding the investigation since a recent investigation by the same body, The Office of Medical Inspector (OMI) had produced a report which was felt by Levenson, Kois and their attorney, Andrea Amadeo-Vickery, to be little more than a whitewash. The OMI also expected witnesses to sign confidentiality agreements in order to testify. Levenson, in an interview on WMUR stated that if they expected him or the other whistleblowers to sign such an agreement, "They were out of their minds." Levenson spoke at several town hall meetings in front of hundreds of concerned veterans, listening to their concerns and discussing means of improving conditions at the Manchester VA. After retiring from his position at the VA Levenson continued to work for improved patient conditions by meeting with the new medical center administrative team and lobbying to become a member of the above task force.

Betty Molesworth Allen

Betty Eleanor Gosset Molesworth Allen (21 July 1913 – 11 October 2002) was a New Zealand botanist. She researched and published extensively on Southeast Asian ferns, and in her retirement she discovered a fern in southern Spain that had previously been thought to be an exclusively tropical species.

Early life.
Molesworth Allen was born on 21 July 1913 in <a href="Opotiki">Opotiki</a>, a small town in the North Island of New Zealand. Her father, Arthur, a farmer, was the <a href="Paris">Paris</a>-born younger son of a <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> rector, the 8th <a href="Viscount%20Molesworth">Viscount Molesworth</a>. Her mother, born Nellie Banks, was a friend of the suffragist Pankhursts. Molesworth Allen suffered tuberculosis, polio and cancer as a child and spent most of her childhood in hospitals and unable to attend schools. However, both her parents were passionate about nature and wildlife, particularly birds, and as a result she grew up with a love of flora and fauna.

Career.
Molesworth Allen became interested in botany through <a href="Lucy%20Cranwell">Lucy Cranwell</a>, a botanist at the <a href="Auckland%20Museum">Auckland Museum</a>. Cranwell introduced her to systematic biology and encouraged her interest in natural history. She was also influenced by G.E. Holloway, also at the Auckland Museum, who inspired her interest in ferns. In 1939, Molesworth Allen was involved in the establishment of the Auckland Botanical Society and was its inaugural secretary. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> Molesworth Allen volunteered for the Women's Auxiallary Air Force, before replacing Cranwell as botanist at Auckland Museum from 1944 to 1947. In these years she made important additions to the museum's collections, including <a href="Moss">mosses</a> and <a href="Cyperaceae">sedges</a> and the field notebooks of <a href="Thomas%20Frederic%20Cheeseman">T.F. Cheeseman</a>.

In 1947 Molesworth Allen received a scholarship to study in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, Switzerland. Stopping over in Malaya, she met and married Geoffrey Allen; declining the scholarship in Switzerland, she instead settled in Malaya where she trained in tropical botany and worked in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. From 1948 she travelled extensively in Southeast Asia, particularly to Malaysia, Borneo and Thailand, observing plants and collecting samples from the jungles. However, her work became dangerous during the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">1948–1960 State of Emergency</a> as Communist guerillas set up camps in the jungles.

In 1963 Molesworth Allen retired to <a href="Los%20Barrios">Los Barrios</a> in <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, Spain, where she continued to collect and study plants, particularly ferns. In January 1965 she discovered the fern "<a href="Psilotum%20nudum">Psilotum nudum</a>" (L.) P. Beauv. growing in <a href="Algeciras">Algeciras</a> in southern Spain, which had previously been assumed to be a solely tropical species. As a result of her discovery, the area was extensively studied and eventually protected as a national park, <a href="Los%20Alcornocales%20Natural%20Park">Los Alcornocales Natural Park.</a>



Honours and recognition.
In 1988, Molesworth was made an adopted daughter of the town of Los Barrios, and a botanical park in the town was named in her honour – the Betty Molesworth Memorial Park. In 1995 she was awarded the <a href="H.%20H.%20Bloomer%20Award">H.H. Bloomer Award</a> by the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a> for her discovery of "Psilotum nudum" in Europe. In the <a href="1997%20Birthday%20Honours">1997 Queen's Birthday Honours</a> she was appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> for services to botany.

The hybrid plants "Narcissus" x "alleniae" and "Centaurea molesworthiae" were named after Molesworth Allen. A part of the <a href="Gua%20Tempurung">Gua Tempurung</a>, the largest limestone cave in <a href="Peninsular%20Malaysia">Peninsular Malaysia</a>, is named the Molesworth Allen Tunnel after her.

Personal life.
In 1948 Molesworth Allen married Geoffrey Allen, a pilot, wildlife photographer and amateur ornithologist. They were married until his death in 1985.

Molesworth Allen died in <a href="Marbella">Marbella</a>, Spain, on 11 October 2002.

American tourists Jenai and Riley arrive in Iceland and visit several landmarks. Riley has taken his father's <a href="Rolleiflex">Rolleiflex</a> camera and plenty of film. When Jenai questions why he prefers it over a modern digital camera, Riley says he prefers to capture the imperfections of the moment rather than have a computer chip auto-correct all the errors. They visit an old church, and a priest tells them some of its history, calling the pre-Christian times simpler. Jenai reveals that her father is a preacher, though she says his church was not as pretty. After retiring for the night, Jenai wakes up in the middle of the night and has trouble falling back asleep. Looking out the window to admire the view, she sees a strange flash in the distance.

Hours later, Riley wakes Jenai to get breakfast. They are frustrated to find that their lodging is not serving breakfast, then confused when they find no staff. They continue having trouble locating other people once they leave: the streets are empty, the stores have no staff, and nobody answers their calls. They spot a running car, and, not being able to locate the owner, appropriate it. As they discuss the possible reasons why the city has become empty, Jenai repeatedly attempts to contact her family in America to no avail. The power and water remain running, but the live television stations broadcast only test signals. Confused, Riley and Jenai return to the hotel after eating, finding no websites have been updated since yesterday.

Riley remains optimistic, and suggests they make the most of the situation. He leads them on a shopping spree, eventually filling up two SUVs with goods from the seemingly abandoned stores. He amuses himself by photographing Jenai at scenic locations and performing stunts. Jenai, however, begins sinking into depression, missing her old life. She is further frustrated when Riley injures himself during a reckless stunt, and she pressures him to promise not to put himself at any further risk. As their supplies grow scarcer, Jenai and Riley are forced to ration. Riley angers Jenai when he eats perishable food out the agreed-upon order based on expiration date. He says he can simply farm for more food if necessary, but she insists they follow the agreement.

Seeing Jenai's poor mood, Riley attempts to cheer her by bringing her to the abandoned husk of an airplane he found. Riley calls it beautiful, but Jenai sees only a reminder of the dead world they now inhabit. After Jenai becomes overwhelmed by the decaying city, Riley suggests they go camping. Exploring a cabin, they come upon an old man named Nils. After they give him food and water, he explains that he left the city early on and returned to his cabin. Initially excited to find another survivor, Riley becomes frustrated with Nils' defeatist attitude. Nils tells Jenai about his home life: as a young man, he left his family for lengthy periods to make money as a fisherman. When he returned, he found they had changed. Jenai is disturbed when he says he did not protest this, as he believes it is useless to fight against God's will, which he says does not take humanity into consideration.

The next morning, Riley tells Jenai that Nils has died. Thinking back to his philosophy, she asks why they should even bother burying him. Riley insists on doing it because "it's what we do". After they return to the city, Jenai becomes obsessed with searching for more survivors. Riley suggests she is looking for answers where there are none and that they should instead be trying to make the best of their new life. Jenai excited opens an email waiting for her on their laptop but is crushed when it is revealed to be a picture from Riley, who is enthused about taking pictures of Iceland in a new season. Riley, when he returns home, becomes concerned when he finds a package of developed pictures left for him by Jenai. Looking all over for her, he finally finds her body floating in a river. Riley initially considers suicide but instead drives off, anguished.

<doc id="54875469" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54875469" title="The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.">
The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.

"The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O." is a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> novel by American writers <a href="Neal%20Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a> and <a href="Nicole%20Galland">Nicole Galland</a>, published in 2017. The story follows the members of a secret U.S. government agency known as the Department of Diachronic Operations (D.O.D.O.) as they attempt to change history through the use of magic. Stephenson and Galland had previously written together on "<a href="The%20Mongoliad">The Mongoliad</a>".

Plot.
U.S. Army Major Tristan Lyons hires Dr. Melisande Stokes, a Harvard linguistics lecturer, to translate a variety of historic texts. The work is classified, to the point that Lyons cannot even reveal the full name of D.O.D.O, the secret government agency that he works for. Stokes' translations suggest that magic and witches existed in the historical record, and also that magic grew weaker and ceased to function sometime during the Industrial Revolution. Stokes and Lyons eventually discover that photography nullifies magic in the general area by causing a <a href="wave%20function%20collapse">wave function collapse</a>. Magic use ended worldwide when a photograph was taken of the <a href="Solar%20eclipse%20of%20July%2028%2C%201851">Solar eclipse of July 28, 1851</a>.

Lyons recruits Dr. Frank Oda, a former MIT physicist who once worked on a device that could prevent wave function collapse. The device is somewhat like the box in the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s%20cat">Schrödinger's cat</a> experiment, though not (potentially) deadly to anyone inside. At the same time, Stokes is contacted by Erszebet Karpathy, a Hungarian witch with a supernaturally-extended lifespan who claims to have met Stokes in 1851 London. Stokes learns that D.O.D.O. stands for the Department of Diachronic Operations, and that Lyons intends to build a device that will enable magic-assisted time travel.

Over the next five years, D.O.D.O. grows in size and scope as a project of <a href="Intelligence%20Advanced%20Research%20Projects%20Activity">IARPA</a> and the <a href="Director%20of%20National%20Intelligence">Director of National Intelligence</a>. Agents are trained in period-specific languages and combat techniques and magically sent back to 1601 Londan and the 1203-1204 Constantinople, among other times and places. The object is to alter historical events to subtly help the United States government, but it has to be done carefully and methodically to avoid Diachronic Shear, a catastrophic magical explosion that occurs when history is changed too much or too quickly. Witches are recruited to form a time travel network and some are even brought to the present to assist D.O.D.O. directly. One of these witches manages to gain control of the agency through the use of magic, and sends Stokes back in time to July 1851 in the hopes that she will be stranded there when magic ceases to work. The D.O.D.O. organization falls apart as members generally fall into two sides: a conspiracy of witches who want to sabotage the foundations of photography (and science itself) and the protagonists who pledge to counter their efforts.

Style.
"The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O." consists of multiples forms of narrative. The core novel is the first-person "Diachronicle" of Melisande Stokes as written in London in July 1851. Her notes are supplemented with journal entries, transcripts, online chat, and other forms of communication. Each is in a different format and font, and many texts are written from the point of view of secondary characters. Some parts are redacted or incomplete. It is explained later that they were secretly (and haphazardly) stolen from D.O.D.O. servers as the organization was collapsing.

Reception.
"<a href="Kirkus%20Reviews">Kirkus Reviews</a>" wrote that the "story gets weirder and more madcap" as it goes, but called the novel "a pleasing combination of much appeal to fans of speculative fiction." "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" also praised the wit and "healthy sense of absurdity." However, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" found that much of the humor didn't work, but that "though it’s no comic classic, "The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O." is big, roomy and enjoyable."

Berkarya Party

Berkarya Party (the Working Party) is an Indonesian political party formed in 2016. The party supports the presidential aspirations of former president <a href="Suharto">Suharto</a>’s youngest son <a href="Hutomo%20Mandala%20Putra">Hutomo Mandala Putra</a>, better known as Tommy Suharto.

Background.
Tommy Suharto in 2009 contested the leadership of <a href="Golkar%20Party">Golkar Party</a>, his father's former political vehicle, but failed to win any votes. In 2016, it was announced that Tommy would again contest the Golkar leadership but he did not enter the race. Instead, he joined the newly formed Berkarya Party.

Berkarya is an amalgamation of Beringin Karya Party and National Republic (Nasrep) Party. It was established on 15 July 2016 to coincide with Tommy's birthday, and was recognized by the government as a legitimate political party on 17 October 2016.

Controversially, Berkarya Party uses Golkar's distinctive banyan tree logo and yellow color. Berkarya Chairwoman Neneng A. Tuty said these were just similarities and not an effort to imitate Golkar.

In 2017, Berkarya announced it would nominate Tommy for the presidency for the 2019-2023 period "to restore Indonesia's glory, such as food self-sufficiency, development and creating justice in the country".

Policies and plans.
Berkarya’s website states the party aims to fight for the people's aspirations and interests in every political and government decision and policy.

In the first year of its existence, Barkarya established its presence in all 34 Indonesian provinces and in 514 regencies and districts, in line with verification requirements for parties seeking to contest the 2019 elections. The party hopes to be ranked among the top three parties in 2019 by capitalizing on nostalgia for the Suharto era. Neneng in 2017 said “we think could be in the top two” because many leaders have wanted to join the party, while many people miss the prosperity of the Suharto era.

Berkarya in 2017 inaugurated a party wing called Perisai (meaning ‘Shield’, an acronym from "Patriot Organisasi Pagar Negeri" or National Fence Patriot Organization). Perisai Chairman Tri Joko Susilo said the organization aims to guard Tommy and the party’s agenda, and protect Indonesia from poverty, disintegration and global challenges. The organization would seek to improve commodity distribution chains to redress imbalances that presently favor middlemen over farmers. Perisai plans to gradually build warehouses or transit points for agricultural products, plantations and fishermen's produce, so that middlemen will no longer exploit producers. Tri Joko said Perisai will help to restore Indonesia’s glory in food self-sufficiency by promoting the use of organic fertilizers to improve soil quality and yields.

Leadership.
Tommy is chairman of the Party High Assembly and Board of Trustees. The party’s chairwoman is Neneng A. Tuty, a former boxing promoter who has also led Nasrep Party and the right-wing nationalist militia group Laskar Merah Putih. Former Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, Rear Admiral Tedjo Purdijatno, is chairman of the party’s Advisory Council. Former Army Special Forces (Kopassus) chief and former State Intelligence Agency deputy chief Muchdi Purwopranjono is chairman of the party's Honorary Board. Former National Military Police chief and former intelligence chief of the Attorney General's Office, Syamsu Djalal, is chairman of the Advisory Board.

Berkarya experienced internal conflict in July 2017 when Central Leadership Board executive Nurul Candrasari, a former Golkar official, was dismissed from her position. She responded by reporting Neneng and Badaruddin to police over her "illegal" dismissal.

<doc id="54875926" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54875926" title="Mission Greenwood-Rootham">
Mission Greenwood-Rootham

Mission Greenwood-Rootham was a World War II <a href="Special%20Operations%20Executive">Special Operations Executive (SOE)</a> expedition to the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland (<a href="chetniks">chetniks</a>) in <a href="Homolje">Homolje</a> district of Eastern Serbia near the border with Romania. The group was led by Maj Erik Greenwood and <a href="Jasper%20Rootham">Maj Jasper Rootham</a> and included Sgt W Anderson (W/T), Sgt C E Hall (RAF) (W/T), Lieut E (Micky) Hargreaves and a <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army">Royal Yugoslav Army (RYA)</a> officer code-named "Arlo".

Purpose.
While <a href="Operation%20Bullseye">Operation Bullseye</a> delivered permanent British presence at chetniks' headquarters of <a href="Dra%C5%BEa%20Mihailovi%C4%87">Col Mihailović</a>, this expedition was a sub-mission to his regional headquarters. In this case, to a strategically important location, able to monitor and disrupt shipping on <a href="Danube">Danube</a> (transporting Romanian oil crucial for the war effort), Belgrade-Salonika railway (used for supply of German troops in North Africa) and <a href="Bor%2C%20Serbia">Bor</a> copper mines (the largest in Europe).

Arrival and initial activities.
The group arrived in two separate trips. Greenwood, Anderson and "Arlo" flew from <a href="Derna%2C%20Libya">Derna</a> airfield and were parachuted in mid-Apr 1943. Due to bad weather, Rootham, Hall and Hargreaves abandoned the first two attempts and were finally successful on 21 May 1943 landing at <a href="Homolje%20mountains">Homolje Mountains</a>.

British ambition for chetniks' engagement was in the acts of sabotage and undermining German war efforts. The strategy meant that they would be supplied with explosives, medical equipment and similar, while they were asking for light-machine guns and ammunition, boots, uniforms and wireless accessories. The discrepancy of intentions between two allied armies became obvious very early in the engagement and grew ever-wider.

In the following few weeks, the mission visited local commanders in the region, passing through <a href="Vlaole">Vlaole</a> and <a href="Gornjane">Gornjane</a>. On 31 May 1943, on their way to <a href="Deli%20Jovan">Deli Jovan</a>, they encountered a young wireless enthusiast who made the very first radio contact between Mihailović and the British naval monitoring station in <a href="Malta">Malta</a> in August 1941, thus starting the chain of events.

Throughout the period, the lack of four-engine long-range aircraft and trained crew, unpredictable weather over the Mediterranean, general bureaucracy and feeling of a 'side-show' meant that flights were fewer and cargo continued to consist of explosive and medical supplies, rather than small arms and ammunition. This raised suspicions of the hosts and frustration of the visitors.

On 15 Jun 1943, three additional soldiers were parachuted. David Russell and his W/T operator Nicolae Turcanu who had a mission to get to Romania (Operation Ranji) as well as a Polish army officer called "Nash" who was to engage with Polish POWs escaped from the Bor mines.

Summer 1943.
On 26 Jun 1943, Rootham observed German-uniformed Slovak soldiers attack the village of Rudna Glava, and saw civilians fleeing across the fields with their life belongings and livestock. The local Serb commander asked him to report to the BBC that 150 civilians were killed. Rootham disputed the number, and the officer reduced it to seventy. Later in the year, when passing through the village itself, Rootham had asked about the number of casualties in the incident and was told that five people were killed then.

Shortly afterwards, he also realised that instead of engaging German or Bulgarian troops, local chetnik commander was fighting the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">partisans</a>. Rootham considered this a clear violation of the agreement and stated that "the arms which we supplied were to be used for fighting the Germans and not for keeping in cold storage or for civil war".

Autumn and winter 1943.
On 21 Aug 1943, while waiting for an aircraft drop, the group came very near German soldiers spending the night in <a href="Crnajka">Crnajka</a>. Chetnik commander had over 60 troops at his disposal and could have ambushed them but decided to withdraw instead. On 26 Aug 1943, Germans set houses in Crnajka on fire as they were leaving. Rootham was upset that the enemy was let go unscathed, while their host, obeying his High Command, failed to engage and was fearful of reprisals.

Later that day, the mission reached <a href="Leskovo">Leskovo</a> for a pre-arranged conference with local commanders. They spoke openly criticizing their hosts' state of training of the troops, poor attention to their weapons as well as lack of discipline under fire or the threat of fire. They asked about Mihailović's plan for Eastern Serbia and demanded an immediate start of sabotage, stating that their rule was "No action, No support". To make matters worse, they quoted the Allied Command HQ telegrams stating that the partisans had been co-operative and had carried out actions. Chetnik commanders bitterly disagreed, claiming the lack of arms, as well as fear that Britain was willing to hand over the Balkans to Russia. Finally, they mentioned that they considered Allied Command instructions to be "requests" and not "orders".

Regardless of the disagreements, the cargo and reinforcements continued to arrive and Lieut Hargreaves acquired his own W/T operator called Ridewood. The following month, as the Italians surrendered, new commander, Brig C D Armstrong had been appointed to Mihailović's HQ. On 20 Sep 1943, new reinforcements Capt Patterson, Capt Vercoe, and Sgt Scott were dropped. Patterson landed without a hitch, but both Vercoe and Scott fell in trees and were heavily injured, unable to walk. 

On 15 Oct 1943, in order to try to sabotage the Bor copper mines, the SOE HQ sent 48-years old Maj Scorgie, a mining-engineer who was hoping to work with someone 'inside'. The ground attack did not go ahead mainly due to the RAF not being able to provide airplanes for the simultaneous diversionary air-raid.

Disruption of Danube shipping - the only sabotage action.
On 22 Oct 1943, Rootham, Greenwood and Scorgie left Gornjane and picked up a former Danube pilot to act as a technical adviser on their way to the river. The plan was to fire a 20-mm anti-tank gun and sink a tug-boat. The gun had 12 rounds of ammunition but no telescopic sights. They reached <a href="Boljetin">Boljetin</a> and started the operation on 26 Oct 1943 around 09:15 by shooting at an approaching German tug-boat "Centaur". They did not sink the tug-boat but managed to hit it and disrupt the shipping lane for some time. The German propaganda leaflets denied this and stated that 150 of Mihailović's supporters in Belgrade were shot on 28 Oct 1943 as a reprisal for this and for the two German soldiers killed near Kladovo earlier in the month. In spite of the awful consequences, Rootham saw the importance of the action. 

The disappointment and withdrawal.
In January 1944, the group had attempted to blow up the main railway bridge over the <a href="Morava%20%28river%29">Morava</a> river, south of <a href="Stala%C4%87">Stalać</a>. Another railway bridge over the <a href="Ibar%20%28river%29">Ibar</a> river was to be destroyed on the same day, thus paralyzing the north-south railway traffic in Serbia. Gen Mihailović was to issue the order for both attacks. In spite of frantic signals sent to Mihailović's HQ for the permission to carry out the plan, the order never came, damaging the morale of the group.

On 2 Mar 1944, the mission received the telegram that the decision had been taken to evacuate all the British men and officers at present with Mihailović and to move towards Brig Armstrong's HQ in Western Serbia. They were not surprised, as few weeks previously, Rootham noted:

During this time Lieut Hargreaves was captured by a small detachment of German ex-Afrika Corps. They delivered him to the Gestapo jail in Belgrade, beat him, took away his clothes and led him out six times to watch executions, not knowing whether he would be next. There, he saw hundreds of civilians shot which confirmed that stories of reprisals were not all invented by the Serbs. Capt Vercoe, still unable to walk, was captured near <a href="Gornja%20Mutnica">Gornja Mutnica</a> on 24 Mar 1944. Both men ended up in the notorious <a href="Oflag%20IV-C">Oflag 4c (Colditz Castle)</a>. Vercoe was repatriated in Jan 1945 while Hargreaves was freed by the American troops in Apr 1945.

As they were preparing to leave, the group came under attack by soldiers of the 25th Bulgarian Division near <a href="%C5%BDagubica">Žagubica</a> when local chetnik commander came to their rescue:

The group received the orders to join Brig Armstrong on 6 Apr 1944 and moved towards Čačak, spending a night at <a href="Kaleni%C4%87%20monastery">Kalenić monastery.</a> On 16 Apr 1944 they observed formations of <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Flying Fortresses</a> and <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Liberator Bombers</a>, flying north towards <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>. The heavy bombardment of the city on Orthodox Easter Sunday caused many civilian casualties and damaged the reputation and support for the Allies. A day later, the mission met up with Gen Draža Mihailović, whom Rootham found modest and conscientious, but also "desperately tired, sad and worried man".

On 29 May 1944, Jasper Rootham said goodbye to Mihailović, as well as <a href="%C5%BDivko%20Topalovi%C4%87">Živko Topalović</a> and <a href="Stevan%20Moljevi%C4%87">Stevan Moljević</a>, and the following night was air-lifted to <a href="Bari">Bari</a>. The next day he was joined by Erik Greenwood, which marked the end of their mission.

Param:Book by Samarpan

Param written by Samarpan ( <a href="Swami%20Samarpanananda">Swami Samarpanananda</a> ) is a story of the journey of a tech savvy young man of the city, to solitude.Param is a supplementary read at <a href="Indian%20Institute%20of%20Management%20Indore">Indian Institute of Management Indore</a> and <a href="Indian%20Institute%20of%20Management%20Ahmedabad">Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad</a> courses.

The theme of the story is to seek the highest. When one aims for the highest, one shall reach it too. The book conveys several messages for mankind. It shows the way to seek the highest by remaining detached, yet performing one's duties of life.
The Message.
Restless minds cannot reach the highest. Such minds run behind newer distractions, money, fame etc. All these are but illusions where humans play different roles to fulfill desires, wearing masks. Solitude inside the mind, with detachment from desires, helps one reach the highest. 

The difference between real and virtual can only be understood in the depths of solitude of the mind. Unless one knows this difference, the wheel of life keeps going on and on. The moment the truth is revealed one comes to know his true identity and becomes unmasked.

Characters and Places.
Param : His life changes when his friend Jing questions him " what would be your last wish if you had seven days to live". The SPARK in the mind occurs. The journey to the Himalayas begins. On the way, Param chanced to stop at a village. The village and its surrounding help him grow mentally and spiritually. 

Poppy : A dog, represents the inner voice or consciousness.

Chilli : The village boy and student of Param representing the modern generation that has intelligence, but won’t use it for meaningful activity.

Polta : The village boy and student of Param who represents the ambitious generation.

Village Idlers : They represent the lost youth of society.

Sona : A deer , representing distractions of the mind.

Pakhawaj Player: The player of percussion. He represents the wisdom that remains unexposed.

The Water Wheel: The process of enlightenment is a reverse process of tracing our way back to the stages of creation and beyond.

Gorakhpur hospital deaths

The Gorakhpur hospital deaths occurred in mid-August 2017, when over 85 children at the state-run <a href="Baba%20Raghav%20Das%20Medical%20College">Baba Raghav Das Medical College</a> in <a href="Gorakhpur">Gorakhpur</a>, <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, died. Some, including <a href="Raj%20Babbar">Raj Babbar</a>, accredited this to a <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> supplier cutting off the hospital for non-payment from the state government but the supplier denied the cutoff.

Events.
The supplier of oxygen to <a href="Baba%20Raghav%20Das%20Medical%20College">Baba Raghav Das Medical College</a> allegedly stopped providing oxygen due to an unpaid debt of US$50,000. Starting on 10 August 2017, 30 children died within 48 hours: 17 children in the neo-natal ward, five in the AES (<a href="acute%20encephalitis%20syndrome">acute encephalitis syndrome</a>) ward and eight in the general ward.

Investigation.
The hospital's principal RK Mishra was suspended on 12 August by the <a href="Government%20of%20Uttar%20Pradesh">Government of Uttar Pradesh</a> for "negligent behaviour" after which he resigned. On 13 August, the head of encephalitis ward at the hospital, Kafeel Khan, was removed as the nodal officer.

On 14 August, Pushpa Sales, the oxygen supplier to the hospital, released a statement that it never stopped the supply of oxygen cylinders despite the outstanding dues. Manish Bhandari, managing director of the company, stated, "The government must find why there were just around 50 cylinders instead of 400 on that particular day when deaths took place. I suspect a big oxygen cylinder theft or racket, which they must find it out."

Reactions.
On 12 August, Indian Prime Minister <a href="Narendra%20Modi">Narendra Modi</a>'s office said he is "constantly monitoring" the situation with Minister of State Health <a href="Anupriya%20Patel">Anupriya Patel</a> and the Union Health Secretary. <a href="Siddharth%20Nath%20Singh">Siddharth Nath Singh</a>, the Health Minister of Uttar Pradesh, denied a lack of oxygen was the cause of the deaths. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister <a href="Yogi%20Adityanath">Yogi Adityanath</a> ordered a probe into the incident. He visited the hospital on 13 August 2017.

Kalijodo Park

Kalijodo Park (), is a newly inaugurated urban park at <a href="Penjaringan">Penjaringan</a>, <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>.The park has a land area of 3.4 hectares (8.4 acres) and located by the side of Krendang River, which was formally opened on 22 February 2017. The park is built after demolishing a <a href="red%20light%20area">red light area</a>.

History.
Name.
Kalijodo was not always been infamous for <a href="prostitution">prostitution</a>, <a href="gambling">gambling</a> and <a href="Alcoholic%20beverage">alcohol</a> sales. It was a neighborhood for <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">Chinese Indonesians</a>. During 1950's, It was also a favorite public place to roam around, as the <a href="Angke%20River">Angke River</a> was clean and with many trees and greenery, which in turn made the area a popular spot for young people to gather. In Indonesian, kali means ‘river’ and jodoh ‘mate’ or ‘soulmate’.The name stemmed from a matchmaking ritual that developed as part of the Chinese Peh Cun holiday, which is the celebration of the hundredth day in the lunar calendar. One tradition in the celebration of peh cun is a water feast. During the festival youngsters would ride on boats down the river and throw bean cakes to members of the opposite sex who caught their eye while floating side by side. Conversely, if a woman accepts, she would throw back with a similar cake. This tradition ceased in 1958 after then Jakarta <a href="Mayor%20Sudiro">Mayor Sudiro</a>, who served in 1953-1960, banned Chinese cultural celebrations.

Red light district.
Kalijodo stretches between North and West Jakarta, but most of it lies in North Jakarta. Prostitution began to develop in the Kalijodo area in 1963. But according to other versions, Kalijodo was a <a href="red%20light%20area">red light area</a> since 1600s. Many fugitives from <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> used to dock in <a href="Batavia">Batavia</a>. After docking they used to visit Kalijodo to find out 
temporary wives or concubines for a replacement of wife back at home. The prospective concubines were predominantly dominated by local women, who would attempt to attract ethnic Chinese men by singing Chinese classical songs on boats floating on the river. The woman who was to become a mistress was called "Cau Bau", which was considered to have a higher status than a prostitute. Nevertheless, the location had activities with money transactions similar to Geisha concept in Japan.

Kalijodo used to be Jakarta's oldest and biggest red-light district. The red light area was demolished on 29 February 2016. At the time of demolition there were about three hundred buildings, with more than sixty cafes and pubs. with about 3,400 population, according to data from the Jakarta administration.

Facilities of the Park.
After demolishing the red light area, the park was built with CSR funds of private companies. The park was built with concept of semi-natural green park, playground, <a href="futsal">futsal</a> court, hall and international-standard skate park. The skate park is one of the largest in the region, and the mural – a collaborative effort by 10 of Indonesia’s top street artists. Kalijodo has turned into one of the family-friendly integrated public spaces in Jakarta, which even used as a concert venu occasionally. The park has four main areas, including a green park, a playground, an indoor football court, an amphitheater, an international-standard skate park and two supporting areas for a <a href="Betawi%20people">Betawi</a>-style mosque and food court.

Controversy.
The Jakarta city government has talked of cleaning up the area for just about as long as it’s existed. Cleaning up Kalijodo would take not just forceful action, but also the courage and political backing to tackle the entrenched gangs. On 9 February 2016, when a 24-year-old drunk driver speeding at 100km/h after consuming ten alcoholic beverages killed four people and landed in prison for six years. This spurred Jakarta city administration to finally demolish the area in a very fast way. Following the demolition, human rights groups spoke out, arguing that rapid eviction violated the principles of involuntary resettlement as dictated in the UN’s International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was ratified by Indonesia in 2005 and mandates consultation with those affected and protections ensuring that no one will be left homeless or vulnerable. Indonesian National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas), raised particular concern over the welfare of Kalijodo’s sex workers (prostitution is ostensibly illegal in Indonesia).

Aarhus Symposium

Aarhus Symposium is an annual leadership conference taking place at the <a href="Aarhus%20University">University of Aarhus</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, on the first Friday in November. The aim of the event is to connect leaders of today with leaders of tomorrow. To do so, a wide range of key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and engage in discussions with students from various universities. Hereby, the symposium allows students to relate their academic insights to the broader business society. 

Aarhus Symposium was founded in 2011 and has since expanded its concept to also involve <a href="Aarhus%20Symposium%23Aarhus_Symposium_Focus">Aarhus Symposium Focus</a> and <a href="Aarhus%20Symposium%23Aarhus_Symposium_Challenge">Aarhus Symposium Challenge</a>.

Aarhus Symposium is a non-profit organisation, and all symposia are organised by voluntary students together with a pro-bono Board of Directors.
History.
Four students at <a href="Aarhus%20University">Aarhus University</a> established Aarhus Symposium in 2011: David Scherer, Jens Riis Andersen, Kasper Vinther Olesen, and Andreas Emmersten. They gathered support from other students to organise the very first Aarhus Symposium with the objective of building a bridge between students, i.e. the future leaders, and leaders in today’s businesses and society.

The first annual Aarhus Symposium welcomed renowned speakers from the business society such as Carsten Bjerg (then CEO of <a href="Grundfos">Grundfos</a>), Lars Rohde (then CEO of <a href="Arbejdsmarkedets%20Till%C3%A6gspension">ATP</a>), and Maria Rønn (CEO of <a href="DR%20%28broadcaster%29">Danmarks Radio</a>). Throughout the years, the programme has extended to include prominent speakers such as <a href="Frederik%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Denmark">His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Denmark</a>, Lars Rebien Sørensen (President & CEO of <a href="Novo%20Nordisk">Novo Nordisk</a>), and the <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> <a href="Prime%20minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Lars%20L%C3%B8kke%20Rasmussen">Lars Løkke Rasmussen</a>.

Aarhus Symposium has grown through the years as a result of wide support from students, speakers, partners, and others. In 2012, the Organising Committee introduced Battle of the Economists; an event to take place on Monday in the week of Aarhus Symposium. It provided a national focus to the overall theme of Aarhus Symposium. The event was renamed Aarhus Symposium Focus in 2016 to broaden the possibilities for topics that exceeds economic issues. 

In 2013, Aarhus Symposium Challenge was established to strengthen the connection between students and the leaders of today. Aarhus Symposium Challenge is an essay competition in which selected speakers put forth a challenge for students to solve. Through their essay, students obtain a seat at both Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus, and they potentially qualify for <a href="Aarhus%20Symposium%23Leaders%27_Forum">Leaders’ Forum</a>. Since its initiation in 2013, an increasing number of students have participated in Aarhus Symposium Challenge, making it the primary sign-up for Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus.

Aarhus Symposium.
Aarhus Symposium takes place on the first Friday in November. Here, business executives and key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and insights regarding a specific theme. They do so with different perspectives that reflect the tracks, i.e. subtopics, of the event.

Aarhus Symposium Focus.
"Formerly known as Battle of the Economists"

Aarhus Symposium Focus is an annual conference which takes place on Monday in the week of Aarhus Symposium. Here, experts with various backgrounds are invited to share their thoughts on a topic related to the overall theme of Aarhus Symposium. The event provides a national focus as the topic strives to reflect one of Denmark’s most critical challenges.

Aarhus Symposium Challenge.
Aarhus Symposium Challenge is an essay competition where selected speakers put forth a challenge for students to solve. By submitting a qualified essay, students obtain a seat at both Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus. Additionally, the participating students compete for the Aarhus Symposium Award and a spot in Leaders’ Forum. 

Leaders' Forum.
Leaders’ Forum is an exclusive and intimate session where selected students discuss their essay contribution with the leader that put forth the respective challenge. Only the best essay contributions under each challenge topic qualifies for this informal session.

Throughout the years, Leaders’ Forum has attracted much attention from the media inasmuch as it is unique in a Danish context and provides both the attending students and the top leaders the opportunity to learn from each other.

The Aarhus Symposium Award.
The most extraordinary essay contribution in Aarhus Symposium Challenge will be rewarded the Aarhus Symposium Award on stage at the very end of Aarhus Symposium. Prior winners of the Aarhus Symposium Award are:
Other events.
Besides facilitating Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus, Aarhus Symposium also hosts a variety of other events that takes places at Aarhus University. Most notable are Aarhus Symposium Theme Announcement and Aarhus Symposium Challenge Launch; both of which are closely linked to the three key elements of Aarhus Symposium.

Organising Committee.
The Organising Committee of Aarhus Symposium consists of approximately 35 voluntary students, who have the responsibility for planning, funding, promoting, and executing all events. The Organising Committee is divided into smaller groups with specific focus areas:

<doc id="54876873" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54876873" title="SNCF 232.Q.1">
SNCF 232.Q.1

The SNCF 232.Q.1 was an experimental prototype  <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a> of the <a href="SNCF">Société nationale des chemins de fer français</a> (SNCF) which entered service in <a href="1940%20in%20rail%20transport">1940</a>. It was <a href="4-6-4">Baltic</a> or 4-6-4 locomotive.

Origins.
The locomotive was ordered on 9 March <a href="1936%20in%20rail%20transport">1936</a> by the <a href="SNCF">Société nationale des chemins de fer français</a> in an attempt to solve the problem of the crankshaft which limited, in part, the speed of the locomotive and its inherent dynamic augment or <a href="hammer%20blow">hammer blow</a>. 

The order for its construction was placed with the firm of <a href="Schneider-Creusot">Schneider et Cie</a>.

Description.
It was decided to equip the locomotive with a conventional high-pressure <a href="boiler">boiler</a> and individual <a href="turbines">turbines</a> for the axles.

The boiler chosen was of the classic fire-tube type. This boiler was pressed to , the maximum pressure for this type of boiler, unlike <a href="SNCF%20232.P.1">232.P.1</a> which had a water-tube boiler pressed to .

The turbines, three in number, powered the driving axles via a <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20Corporation">Westinghouse</a>-type elastic link. They has a maximum speed of 10,000 rpm at a speed of . This drive system had the advantage of dispensing with the connecting rods, thus eliminating any oscillating motion and the hammer blow on the track.

Due to the absence of connecting rods, the locomotive had outside frames. It was also fitted with an integral fairing.

Service history.
The locomotive was rolled out of the <a href="Schneider%20Electric">Schneider et Cie's</a> <a href="Le%20Creusot">Creusot</a> factory in early June <a href="1940%20in%20rail%20transport">1940</a>, and commenced testing. However, the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a> quickly caused the tests to be suspended, and the locomotive went into store in the manufacturer's workshops as early as 12 June. The tests resumed later in September, before they were moved to the <a href="Vitry-sur-Seine%20test%20plant">Vitry-sur-Seine test plant</a> in October 1940. The first series of tests showed that the locomotive was very quiet and very stable. From 16 January 1942, the locomotive was used to haul workers' trains in the Creusot area, and regular trains between <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Dijon">Dijon</a>. Damage to the central turbine forced its return the manufacturer, where it survived its first bombardment without damage.  Subsequently, it was moved to Laumes <a href="Motive%20power%20depot">depot</a>, where it survived a second bombardment unscathed. Finally, it was sabotaged by the retreating German Army in August 1944. While deemed repairable, authorisation for its restoration was refused on 8 August 1946. Authorisation for retirement was granted in April 1947, and it was stuck from the roster in January 1948. 

Conclusion.
The locomotive was designed to reduce the number of moving parts, and to give a smoother ride.  However, the delay caused by the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> and the <a href="SNCF">SNCF</a>'s choice of electric traction, meant that the good results obtained did not secure a future for steam traction. Parallels can be drawn with the other prototypes that finally came too late:  2-<a href="SNCF%20232.P.1">232.P.1</a>,  3-<a href="SNCF%20242.A.1">242.A.1</a>, and 4-<a href="SNCF%20160.A.1">160.A.1</a>.

Tender.
The <a href="Tender%20%28rail%29">tender</a> coupled to 232.Q.1 was an ex-<a href="Chemins%20de%20fer%20de%20Paris%20%C3%A0%20Lyon%20et%20%C3%A0%20la%20M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e">PLM</a> 30.A bogie type that had a capacity of of water and of <a href="Bituminous%20coal">coal</a>. It was fitted with a steam-driven coal pusher to ease the task of the fireman.

Makedonsko Devojče 2

Makedonsko Devojče 2 (original title in <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a> <a href="Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic</a>: Македонско девојче 2, translation in <a href="English%20language">English</a>: Macedonian Girl 2) is the eighth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by Macedonian singer <a href="Karolina%20Go%C4%8Deva">Karolina Gočeva</a>, first released on 25 February 2014. <a href="Avalon%20production">Avalon Production</a> released the album in <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a> while Croatian record label <a href="Dallas%20Records">Dallas Records</a> released it throughout ex-<a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>n countries in April 2015. The album consists of eight original songs which were written by Valentin Soklevski and Vesna Malinova and see arrangement and production credits by Nikola Micevski and Dejan Momirovski. Except for those eight songs, two cover versions are also included, one of them being of a Macedonian traditional song and the other one of a record originally performed by Macedonian singer <a href="Pepi%20Baftiroski">Pepi Baftiroski</a>. For Gočeva, the motivation to record the album came from the critical and commercial success of her previous project inspired by the Macedonian traditional music, "<a href="Makedonsko%20Devoj%C4%8De%20%28album%29">Makedonsko Devojče</a>" (2008).

The project's finalization lasted for two years due to the intention of the team behind it to improve it as much as possible. According to Gočeva and the producer Micevski, the group's members' acquaintance with each other helped them in setting the right musical direction with the recording of "Makedonsko Devojče 2". Musically, the album is similar to its predecessor; the songs are characterized by elements of <a href="Music%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonian traditional music</a>, but are adapted to a modern style which is contemporary at the time of the release of the album, thus containing <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and <a href="jazz%20music">jazz</a> elements. The lyrics cover states of sadness, happiness, love and longing of a mellow woman. The songs were written and composed specifically for Gočeva, taking into account her wide <a href="vocal%20range">vocal range</a>; all of them are sang without any backing vocals.

The album was a critical success among Macedonian <a href="music%20journalism">music critics</a> and the public. It also achieved wide commercial success becoming the best-selling album of 2014 in Macedonia. Three <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> were released from "Makedonsko Devojče 2"; the song "Čalgiska" was published on 6 December 2013 before the album's release, "Dve liri (ne ni bilo pišano)" was published in January 2014 and "Koj da mi zapee" was released as a single in April 2015, being sent to radio stations in Macedonia and the other Ex-Yugoslavian countries. In order to promote "Makedonsko Devojče 2", Gočeva held many concerts across different cities in Macedonia before and after the release of the album. Most of them were professionally recorded and broadcast on various TV shows in the country and were uploaded and shared on the singer's social media and <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> accounts. From 2015, the album was also promoted in <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>.

Background.
In 2008, Gočeva released the album "<a href="Makedonsko%20Devoj%C4%8De%20%28album%29">Makedonsko Devojče</a>" in collaboration with composer Zlatko Origjanski. The album features elements of <a href="Music%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonian traditional music</a> and it represents a change in the musical style for the singer. According to Gočeva, the album served as an experimental work for her in order to establish whether she would be able to successfully record folk type of music. "Makedonsko Devojče" turned out to be a big commercial and critical success, becoming the best-selling album in Macedonia in the year of its release and receiving the award for Best World Music Album at the 2008 <a href="Sun%C4%8Dane%20Skale">Sunčane Skale</a> festival. Its popularity among the Macedonian public lasted for several years after its release.

After her audience's demand to continue performing similar songs, Gočeva decided to record a second album in the same musical direction. "Makedonsko Devojče 2" is a successor to the album released in 2008 and it contains songs composed in the vein of the Macedonian folklore music. The plans to record the album were revealed by Gočeva for the first time during an interview in May 2012 with the magazine "Naš Svet", confirming that she had already begun with the selection of songs that would be included on the track listing of the second edition of the project "Makedonsko Devojče". In the initial stages of the album's development, "Makedonsko Devojče 2" served only as a working title and later became its official title in order to emphasize that the musical style is the same as that of "Makedonsko Devojče" (2008).

A team of renown Macedonian musicians was responsible for handling the instrumentation and arrangement of the songs from the album; some of the most influential ones include Olver Josifoski from the music group Ljubojna, Zoran Kostadinovski from Kabadajas, Boško Mangarovski from Chalgija Sound System and Goce Uzunski from Synthesis. The album contains eight original songs written and composed by Nikola Micevski, Valentin Soklevski and Vesna Malinova. The songwriters took into account that their songs are specifically written to be performed by Gočeva, thus trying to make them fitting for her broad <a href="vocal%20range">vocal range</a> and adaptable musical performance, which can range different music genres. Two cover versions are also included on the album; the first one, "Te vidov i se zaljubiv" is a Macedonian traditional song and the second one, "Ako zgrešam neka izgoram", was originally sung by <a href="Pepi%20Baftiroski">Pepi Baftiroski</a> and written by Mile and Gjorgji Barbarovski.

Recording and development.
The work on the album lasted for two years, due to the group working behind it paying attention to details and trying to record the best possible version of the material at hand, at the same time maintaining slow-paced progress. The work on the album began in 2012; after the songs were written, Micevski recorded <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> versions and sent them to Gočeva. After she listened to them, the singer started a song selection process, choosing the most fitting ones among the numerous that were written for her. She decided recording and including ten songs on the track listing of her new album. "Makedonsko Devojče 2" was recorded at studio XL by Dejan Momirovski in <a href="Skopje">Skopje</a>. During an interview with the portal IdiVidi, Gočeva explained that the group working on the album consisted of her long-time professional acquaintances, thus rendering the process of working with them easy and pleasant due to the presence of an "excellent atmosphere". The long-time collaboration and the previous experiences they have had together served as a lesson for attaining perfection, making Gočeva more self-confident and determined in taking a specific direction with the album. During an interview on the TV show "Carpe diem" on the TV channel <a href="Alsat-M">Alsat-M</a> in February 2014, Gočeva called the album her best work she had published yet. The maturity she had gained throughout her career served as an inspiration of "modernizing the traditional"; Gočeva said that the Macedonian folklore is something existing in the blood of <a href="Macedonians%20%28ethnic%20group%29">the Macedonian people</a> and added that her album was not characterized by typical traditional songs but rather songs drawing inspiration from that kind of music. Through the new tracks, she allowed her musical performance to stand out and leave a certain long-lasting contribution to Macedonian contemporary music. The singer also acknowledged that the music she had recorded for the album was not popular on a worldwide scale, but emphasized that the sound is more authentic for Macedonia as compared to other mainstream popular genres across the world such as <a href="hip%20hop">hip hop</a>, pop and <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>.

Micevski, the album's producer, is also one of the people who had had a long-time professional relationship with the singer and who had contributed for the arrangement of the songs included on "Makedonsko Devojče" (2008); the start of the professional ties with Gočeva began when he joined her live band which performed during her concerts in the past. He said that due to the mutual understanding between the two of them, the process of setting a music direction with the album was without any difficulty but slow-moving nevertheless due to their intention to create high quality material. During an interview with the journal "Republika", Micevski said that his work on "Makedonsko Devojče 2" represented both responsibility and pressure to a certain extent. He elaborated that the requirement with the album was to create something that would resemble the first project, but will not be identical to it and at the same time would maintain the same level of quality or even surpass it. He added: "To me, that represented a big challenge and maybe a life chance to express myself differently, uniquely, with a different mark, with all my knowledge and spirit. It was an additional pleasure working with my close friend and collaborator Dejan Momirovski... In the end we all managed to do what we had had in mind." Micevski also revealed that all the songs included in the album were originally custom-made for Gočeva, adapted to her vocal capabilities and musical maturity, adding that she is a "world performer" and a singer who can sing in numerous different styles: "She can simply find her way anywhere and she does it on a very high level. The mark she left on the material of 'Makedonsko Devojče 1 and 2' is a really unique, original style of performance which leaves traces in the history of Macedonian <a href="Vocal%20music">vocal</a>-instrumental music."

Composition and lyrics.
According to Gočeva, the album features elements of <a href="ethno%20jazz">ethno jazz</a> in addition to the prominent elements of Macedonian folklore music. Critics also noted elements of <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and <a href="jazz%20music">jazz</a> in the songs and added that they represent an internationalization of the sound of traditional Macedonian music. The lyrics cover various topics which express states of happiness, sadness, love and longing of a mellow female protagonist. Instrumentally, the songs on "Makedonsko Devojče" 2 contain the following instruments: <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>, <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a>, <a href="horn%20%28instrument%29">horn</a>, <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a>, <a href="violin">violin</a>, <a href="qanun%20%28instrument%29">qanun</a>, <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a> and <a href="percussion%20instrument">percussion</a>.

The album opens with the seven-minute song "Koj da mi zapee" () which expresses the sadness and the hard emotional state experienced by a mellow woman who has recently lost her beloved one who used to sing songs to her while they were together. The song's title and the lyrics "Žedna sum, žedna za poj" () and "„[E]h što mi beše srceto živo, eh što si imav so nego život" () illustrate her feelings of longing, need for love and sadness for her lost youth. Journalist Bečković described it as a "classic in the new Macedonian <a href="%C4%8Dalgija">čalgija</a>“. The second song from the album is "Čalgija" which is characteristic for its rhyming lyrics and its prominent elements of čalgija, a characteristic Macedonian music genre. "Vezi, vezi" (), the third song of "Makedonsko Devojče 2" is an <a href="elegy">elegy</a> for migration workers. "Sakam da ne te sakam" () speaks of an adulterous lover and represents the position of the cheated female protagonist.

"Dve liri (ne ni bilo pišano)" () contains lyrics sang by a woman for her past lover. It represents a song entrusted from a grandmother to her granddaughter to be played as her wedding song. Although the grandmother has passed way and has not heard the song played at her granddaughter's wedding, the granddaughter i.e. the song's protagonist, fulfills her wish and uses two <a href="lira">lire</a> to order a song from the band playing music at the wedding of her ex-lover to which she is partaking as an invitee. "Ke pijam ljubov do kraj" () has joyful lyrics about love and according to Bečković, it is musically similar to the playful rhythm typical of <a href="bosa%20nova">bosa nova</a> due to the fact that Gočeva is accompanied by fast horns and a <a href="double%20bass">double bass</a>. In the song, the female protagonist sings about a "blazing kiss". The song "Son" () contains a "fairy tale-like" atmosphere. It describes a "fleeting beauty once we open our eyes" and how real life is different from a dream, as portrayed in the lyrics "Pusta ostana želba nevina, son si mina i ti si zamina... Ne znam koj e kriv, Bože daj mi zdiv" (). The cover versions of "Te vidov i se zaljubiv" () and "Ako zgrešam neka izgoram" () are characterized by arrangements which differ significantly from the original versions and rhythmically match the overall music atmosphere of the album.

He noted that the lyrics of the songs were genuine and leave an impression of being someone's real past experiences, thus showcasing the singer's intention to leave a long-lasting project behind her. He added how "leaning to her internal instincts and needs, she elevates her power and spirituality to a higher level". Bečković also thought that the album's uniqueness lies in its combination of various musical elements which distinguish it from classical Macedonian čalgija. He concluded his review, observing that at the very beginning of 2014, the Macedonian music scene had already received its album of the year. 

In his article published in "Radio Slobodna Evropa", Ljupcho Jolevski called the album "magical and multilayered... an accomplishment which has an instant likability, but which you discover with each next listen". Jolevski praised the team responsible for the arrangement and the instrumentation for their efforts to give their best in the album's songs He described the sound of "Makedonsko Devojče 2" as a mixture of Macedonian folklore and the "ocean of worldwide sounds". According to Jolevski, the album elevates to an "amazing collection of songs which defy the ugliness of rhythms and simple lyrics which we are splashed with on a daily basis". At the end of his article, Jolevski concluded that the singer has reached her musical zenith and the brightest point of her career with the album characteristic of her hometown, Bitola. He concluded that the album "brings the sounds and customs of the <a href="Old%20Bazaar%20of%20Bitola">Old Bazaar of Bitola</a>, the city that even nowadays somehow resists the <a href="Turbo-folk">turbo</a>-attacks from all sides". 

Writing for the portal Vistina, Maja Bećković credited the singer for conveying "so much warmth, so many emotions" in an album; she called "every word - a new pearl, every verse - gold, every vocal - a shining diamond". She continued describing the songs as "so authentic, so old, so archaic and yet, so modern and rich, both production and author-wise". The journalist observed that the lyrics were carefully selected with every track eligible for "a compilation containing the best <a href="Lyric%20poetry">lyric songs</a> from this region, which contains so many centuries of elegy and sadness, interwoven with rare moments of joy, which make life worth living". She credited the singer for adding even more value to what already was valuable material arranged for the album and concluded, "All in all, Macedonian girl will touch your heart and spirit even for the second time".

According to Avalon Production, "Makedonsko Devojče 2" was the best-selling album in Macedonia in the year of its release. The songs on the album were well-received by the concertgoers in Macedonia and Serbia and were among the audience's favorites later on. During an interview with the television channel N1, Gočeva revealed that all the songs had become evergreens in Macedonia. When asked about her future projects and whether she would return to recording pop music as she did before the release of music inspired by Macedonian folklore as in "Makedonsko Devojče 1" and "Makedonsko Devojče 2" or she would continue in the same direction as those two albums, Gočeva said that "there is no reason why I would not make one more project like that".

<doc id="54877204" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54877204" title="Loot box">
Loot box

A loot box is a consumable virtual item in <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s which can be redeemed to receive a randomised selection of further virtual items. A loot box is typically a form of <a href="Video%20game%20monetization">monetization</a>, with players either buying the boxes directly or receiving the boxes during play and later buying “keys” with which to redeem them.

A player’s inventory of loot boxes and other virtual items is stored in a database run by the game’s owners, and it is common to be able to view the items owned by other players either by seeing them equipped on in-game characters or by directly browsing others’ item inventories. Some games also allow players to trade inventory items among themselves for other items, currency, or both.

Loot boxes are regulated under <a href="gambling%20law">gambling law</a> in some Asian countries. Elsewhere they are criticised for being a form of unregulated gambling often marketed to children.

Design.
Loot boxes are often given to players during play, for instance as rewards for <a href="levelling%20up">levelling up</a> their character or completing a <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> game without quitting. Players can also buy them directly. Some loot boxes can be redeemed immediately, while redeeming others requires further consumable items dressed as “keys”.

Loot boxes are generally redeemed through an in-game interface which dresses the process with appealing visual and audio effects. Some such interfaces are explicitly modelled on <a href="Slot%20machine">slot machines</a> or <a href="Roulette%20wheel">roulette wheels.</a> When the player runs out of loot boxes or keys, a prominent button is displayed with which they can buy more.

The items that can be granted by a loot box are usually graded by “rarity”, with the probability of receiving an item decreasing rapidly with each grade. While the set of items given are randomly selected it can come with certain guarantees, for instance that it will contain at least one item of a certain rarity or above.

Most loot box systems grant items without regard for what the player already owns. Means are provided to dispose of these duplicates, often involving trading them with other players or converting them into an in-game currency.

In some loot box systems, a set of “common” items can be combined once completed in order to form a rarer item. The first few items in a set can be rapidly acquired but as the number of missing items decreases in becomes increasingly unlikely that redeeming a loot box will complete the set. This is particularly true if there are a large number of “common” items in the game, since eventually one single, specific item is required. Loot box systems of this nature <a href="%23Japan">are illegal in Japan</a>.

Upcoming game will introduce a loot box spectator system in which players who watch other players open their loot boxes can win prizes for doing so.

Regulation.
China and Japan both regulate loot boxes in various ways. Singapore has passed legislation to regulate online gambling with virtual items but went on to exclude most <a href="free-to-play">free-to-play</a> or loot box games from its provisions.

China.
In December 2016 China’s <a href="Ministry%20of%20Culture%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">Ministry of Culture</a> announced legislation which required “online game publishers” to publicly release from May 2017 onwards the “draw probability of all virtual items and services”. When the law came into effect publishers complied, resulting in a variety of statistics being released which quantified the odds of Chinese players receiving different categories of item from each loot box, some of which were as low as 0.1%.

The law also banned game publishers from directly selling “lottery tickets” such as loot boxes. In June 2017 <a href="Blizzard%20Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> announced that, “in line with the new laws and regulations”, loot boxes in their game <a href="Overwatch%20%28video%20game%29">Overwatch</a> would no longer be available for purchase in China. Players would instead buy in-game currency and receive loot boxes as a “gift” for making the purchase.

Japan.
In May 2012 Japan’s <a href="Consumer%20Affairs%20Agency">Consumer Affairs Agency</a> banned the practice of “<a href="kompu%20gacha">kompu gacha</a>”, in which a predetermined set of items gained from loot boxes would combine once completed to form a rarer and thus more valuable item. This was done not by introducing any new legislation, but by issuing a legal opinion that virtual items could be considered “prizes” under existing legislation written in 1977 to prevent the kompu gacha practice in the context of baseball <a href="Trading%20card">trading cards</a>. Within a month of the opinion being issued all major Japanese game publishers had removed kompu gacha rules from their games.

Singapore.
In October 2014 <a href="Parliament%20of%20Singapore">Singapore’s parliament</a> passed The Remote Gambling Act, which introduced a ban on unlicensed gambling websites and fines for anyone violating it. The law’s definition of gambling included staking “virtual credits, virtual coins, virtual tokens, virtual objects or any similar thing that is purchased...in relation to a game of chance”, leading to concerns that it would require producers of any game in which players paid money and received a randomised outcome to seek a license to operate from the government.

In response to games industry lobbying home affairs minister <a href="S.%20Iswaran">S. Iswaran</a> clarified the law in parliament, stating that “the Bill does not intend to cover social games in which players do not play to acquire a chance of winning money and where the game design does not allow the player to convert in-game credits to money or real merchandise outside the game”. The minister also specifically excluded platforms which offered “virtual currencies which can be used to buy or redeem other entertainment products”, such as <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>, from the provisions of the bill.

However the minister also said:

The fact is that the line between social gaming and gambling is increasingly becoming blurred. What may appear benign today can quickly morph into something a lot more sinister tomorrow in response to market opportunities and consumer trends. That is why the legislation is cast broadly.

History.
Loot boxes are an extension of randomised <a href="Loot%20system">loot drop systems</a> from earlier video games. Loot box random drop system can be thought of as similar to <a href="booster%20pack">booster pack</a>s for <a href="trading%20card">trading card</a>s. An early example of the two being brought together was seen in September 2010 when <a href="Valve%20Corporation">Valve Corporation</a> added “crates” to <a href="Team%20Fortress%202">Team Fortress 2</a> in the run-up to the game going <a href="free-to-play">free-to-play</a>. Over the next few years many <a href="Massively%20multiplayer%20online%20game">MMOs</a> also transitioned to a free-to-play business model and almost all added loot boxes in the process, with the first two being both <a href="Star%20Trek%20Online">Star Trek Online</a> and <a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20Online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> in December 2011.

The first purchasable game (excluding Team Fortress 2) to feature loot boxes was <a href="Mass%20Effect%203">Mass Effect 3</a>, which launched in March 2012 with a variety of “packs” in its multiplayer mode. This was followed in August 2013 by adding “weapon cases” with its Arms Deal update. In October 2013 <a href="Battlefield%204">Battlefield 4</a> launched with “battlepacks”, though they did not become purchasable until May 2014 and never granted duplicate items. (Later Battlefield games switched to more typical loot box rules.)

Today, loot boxes are found in many top-selling games: in 2016 they appeared in <a href="Overwatch%20%28video%20game%29">Overwatch</a>, , , <a href="Battlefield%201">Battlefield 1</a>, <a href="Paragon%20%28video%20game%29">Paragon</a>, <a href="Gears%20of%20War%204">Gears of War 4</a>, and <a href="FIFA%2017">FIFA 17</a> among others.

Mantineia base

The Mantineia Base is an ensemble of three <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20art">ancient Greek</a> <a href="bas%20relief">bas relief</a> plaques, one of which depicts <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, <a href="Marsyas">Marsyas</a> and a <a href="silenus">silenus</a>, and the other two of which each show a group of three <a href="Muses">Muses</a>. They were discovered in 1887 on the site of the ancient Gree city of <a href="Mantineia">Mantineia</a> in <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a> and were probably decoration for a statue base. They have been attributed to the sculptor <a href="Praxiteles">Praxiteles</a> or another member of his workshop. They are currently kept in the <a href="National%20Archaeological%20Museum%20of%20Athens">National Archaeological Museum of Athens</a>, where their inventory numbers are NAMA 215-217.

Description.
On 11 August 1887 in the course of excavations at Mantineia by the <a href="French%20School%20at%20Athens">French School at Athens</a>, the archaeologist Gustave Fougères discovered the three plaques, which had been reused in the floor of a <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> church. The upper part had been heavily worn by the passage of the parishioners, but the side facing downwards still bore sculpted decoration in a good state. The plaques were immediately transferred to the <a href="National%20Archaeological%20Museum%20of%20Athens">National Archaeological Museum of Athens</a>, where they were restored.

They are made of white marble, which was once identified as the marble of Doliana, near <a href="Tegea">Tegea</a>, but as now recognised to be <a href="Pentalic">Pentalic</a> marble. The three plaques have very similar dimensions: NAMA 216 is 1.35 m wide and 0.96 m high; NAMA 215 and 217 are 1.36 m by 0.96 m and 0.98 m respectively. Their depth varies from 8 to 12 cm. They are decorated in the same way: on the upper part, an <a href="Echinus%20%28molding%29">Echinus</a> moulding above a broad flat band, on the lower edge there is a concave moulding and another broad flat band. Each panel has three attachment holes in the same locations. These aspects indicate that they were all made together..

Each plaque depicts three figures on a blank background. They are juxtaposed simply, without any complicated compositional features.

Apollo and Marsyas (NAMA 216).
At left, the god <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> is represented seated, with long hair, wearing a <a href="chiton">chiton</a> and <a href="himation">himation</a>, and holding a <a href="kithara">kithara</a> in his left hand which rests on his left knee. With his right hand he grabs a fold in his himation. At right, <a href="Marsyas">Marsyas</a> is shown with a beard, his left leg bent, playing the <a href="aulos">aulos</a> (double flute). In the centre a bearded man is standing, wearing a kind of <a href="Phrygian%20cap">Phrygian cap</a>, a chiton, and "anaxyrides" (trousers), holding a knife in one hand. Based on the identifications of the other two figures, he must be the servant who flays Marsyas after he loses his musical contest against Apollo.

Muses (NAMA 215 and 217).
The other two plaques represent the Muses, who, in some versions of the myth of Marsyas, were the judges of the contest. The Muses are differentiated. On NAMA 215, the one on the left holds an aulos, the one in the centre holds the folds of her himation, and the one on the right is seated and plays a little <a href="string%20instrument">string instrument</a> - perhaps a <a href="Bandora%20%28instrument%29">bandora</a>. On NAMA 217, the left Muse holds some unrolled parchment, the central Muse holds a rolled-up scroll in her left hand, and the right Muse holds up a kithara in her right hand. Canonically, there were nine Muses, so presumably there was a fourth plaque depicting the missing three Muses.

Attribution.
When he published the discovery, Fougères suggested that the three palques decorated the sides of a rectangular pedestal and suggested that they be associated with a passage of <a href="Pausanias">Pausanias</a> who mentions in his description of Mantineia, "a sanctuary of <a href="Leto">Leto</a> and her children; it was <a href="Praxiteles">Praxiteles</a> who made the statues, two generations after <a href="Alcamenes">Alcamenes</a>; on their base there are carvings of a Muse and a Marsyas playing the aulos."

This text which has been transmitted mentions only a single Muse and presents a difficulty in that while representations of Marsyas playing the flute with a single <a href="Maenad">Maenad</a> are common, there are no known representations of Marsyas playing the flute with a single Muse. To resolve the problem, it has been suggested that Pausanias, whose descriptions are often very vague, was confused and has mistaken Apollo for a Muse. Fougères proposed to emend Μοῦσα (Muse) to Μοῦσαι (Muses), a correction which has been widely accepted since.
The main objection to this hypothesis concerns the proposed arrangement of the base, with the plaque of Apollo and Marsyas on the front, the plaques of the Muses on the sides. This would create a base measuring 1.36 x 1.36 metres, which would be too small for the three statues that Pausanias mentions. The three plaques could instead be arranged next to one another, with Apollo and Marsyas in the centre and the Muses on either side, but there are no traces of attachments for connecting the plaques on their sides, which argues against this hypothesis. It has been proposed to see the plaques as the decoration for a platform for the competitors of a musical contest which took place every year in Arcadia according to <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a>. Indeed, one of the heads of the Muses of NAMA 217 was recovered from the ruins of the theatre. However, this reconstruction is not supported by any archaeological evidence..

Jacob Caproens

Jacob Caproens or Jac. Caproens ("fl" 1675-1725 in Antwerp) was a <a href="still%20life">still life</a> <a href="painter">painter</a> active in Antwerp in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Only a handful of works by the artist have been identified to date. Caproens painted flower and fruit still lifes, garland paintings and banquet still lifes.
Life.
Nothing is known about the life of Jacob Caproens. The first mention of the artist is in an 18th-century sale catalogue, which mentions one large flower painting and two large flower and fruit paintings by Caproens. He is believed to have been active in Antwerp. While some art historians have situated the period of his activity between 1675 and 1725 others place it earlier between 1653 and 1672.

Work.
Caproens painted flower and fruit still lifes, garland paintings and banquet still lifes. Caproens' signature has been found on at least three large flower and fruit still lifes, which are clearly inspired by Flemish still life painting. His banquet style still lifes depicting food and tableware placed on a table also show the influence of <a href="Jan%20Davidszoon%20de%20Heem">Jan Davidszoon de Heem</a>, a Dutch still life painter who was active in Antwerp from the mid-1630s.

Caproens produced a number of compositions in the genre of 'garland paintings'. Garland paintings are a type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp by <a href="Jan%20Brueghel%20the%20Elder">Jan Brueghel the Elder</a> and subsequently practised by leading Flemish still life painters, and in particular <a href="Daniel%20Seghers">Daniel Seghers</a>. The first paintings in this genre typically showed a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. In the later development of the genre, the devotional image was replaced by other subjects such as portraits, mythological subjects and allegorical scenes.

Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life painter who painted the garland and a figure painter who filled the central cartouche with an image. The cartouche in the center of Caproens's garland paintings is filled with religious as well as mythological imagery. A pair of garland paintings entitled and (Town hall of <a href="Braunlage">Braunlage</a>) have respectively a religious and secular cartouche.

According to pro-Chetnik sources, Lazarević supported Chetniks during the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.During short-lived communist rule in Montenegro in 1941, Lazarević resisted to communists in his <a href="Kulla%20%28Balkans%29">kulla</a> in Lipovo with several of his relatives. Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović stayed in Lipovo in period mid 1942 — beginning of 1943.

The house of Lazarević was perfect choice of Chetnik headquarter () because it was situated on a hill which dominated whole of its surrounding. According to report of the Commander of Communist Durmitor Detachment, Partisans attacked Gornje Lipovo and performed cleansing operation which included the house of Savo Lazarević. The communists had an order to establish their own headquarter in the house of Savo Lazarević. 

The communist forces tried to kill him because they concluded he was "irreversible reactionary and enemy of <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20War%20%28Yugoslavia%29">People's Liberation War</a>". Their first attempt in March 1942 was not successful. They succeeded in June 1943.

Savo Lazarević was 93 when, together with his brother Vučeta and Gligorije Puletić from Gornje Lipovo, defended his house from the attacking communist forces. They resisted three days to attacking communist forces and killed 5 Partisans. When they spent all their ammunition, they committed suicide with hand granades.

Mar vanwa tyalieva

The Cottage of Lost Play.
or under its elvish title: "Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva"

Poem.
Originally under the Old English title: The Cottage of Lost Play (or the little house of play) was an early poem written by "J.R.R" Tolkien 

Early versions.
Both the original and the last version of the poem are included in <a href="https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DThe_Book_of_Lost_Tales%26amp%3Baction%3Dedit%26amp%3Bsection%3D3">The Book of Lost Tales</a>.

Adaptations.
You and Me- we know that land

And often have been there

in the old days now gone by,

old Nursery days

A dark child and a fair

 ·   ·   ·  We know that land-You and I

And often wandered there

In the old days, now long gone by

A gloomy child and one (that is) fair

in Quenya.
Recently there has been "a-not-too-literal" translation of the poem into Elvish, Quenya specifically. Since it hasn't been shown anywhere else I proudly display it on this Wiki for the time being. See above for the original poem(s) in "not-too-old" Old English. So in other words it's composed in the 19-20th century mode of English like most of Tolkien's work often is.

Suzee Slater

Suzanne M. Slater, also credited as Suzee Slater, is an American former actress and model best known as Leslie Todd in the horror film "<a href="Chopping%20Mall">Chopping Mall</a>". She had several minor roles in movies and television in the late 1980s and early 1990s before abruptly leaving the acting industry.

Early life and career.
Suzee Slater was born on June 13 in <a href="Goodland%2C%20Kansas">Goodland, Kansas</a> and was raised in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>. She attended the <a href="University%20of%20Nebraska%E2%80%93Lincoln">University of Nebraska</a> for one year, then worked as a flight attendant for <a href="Champion%20Air">MGM Grand Air</a>, specializing in short-run celebrity flights. Slater eventually met a <a href="talent%20agent">talent agent</a> at an airline party. After landing a role on an episode of the television series "<a href="Mickey%20Spillane%27s%20Mike%20Hammer">Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer</a>", Slater joined the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> and moved to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. She quickly earned brief appearances in the 1984 films "<a href="Savage%20Streets">Savage Streets</a>" and "Summer Fantasy".

Slater's most well-known acting credit came as she played the ill-fated Leslie Todd in the 1986 horror movie "<a href="Chopping%20Mall">Chopping Mall</a>", directed by <a href="Jim%20Wynorski">Jim Wynorski</a> and co-produced by <a href="Roger%20Corman">Roger</a> and <a href="Julie%20Corman">Julie Corman</a>. One of Roger Corman's few requirements was a certain amount of gratuitous nudity, a staple of his production company's releases. Wynorski cast Slater based on her statuesque, buxom figure. Her character's exploding-head death sequence is cited as one the now-<a href="cult%20film">cult film</a>'s most memorable scenes among horror aficionados. In a 1993 interview with the magazine "<a href="Femme%20Fatales%20%28magazine%29">Femme Fatales</a>", Slater admitted a certain amount of regret for doing the movie, claiming it "falsely linked <nowiki>[her]</nowiki> to a damned <nowiki>'</nowiki><a href="scream%20queen">scream queen</a><nowiki>'</nowiki> title."

After "Chopping Mall", she continued to gain minor <a href="bit%20part">bit part</a>s in movies and some short-lived television shows through the end of the decade, as well as modeling work for the likes of glamour photographer <a href="Peter%20Gowland">Peter Gowland</a>. Many of her film roles involved nudity, which she stated she did not mind. However, she wished to avoid being <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as a "topless bimbo" character, even turning down a role in <a href="Jeff%20Broadstreet">Jeff Broadstreet</a>'s "Sexbomb" despite her need for work. Slater mentioned in a 1989 "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" article that she desired "a part in a really steamy movie, like "<a href="9%C2%BD%20Weeks">9½ Weeks</a>". Her last major role in the movie industry as she played Heather Black in the 1994 <a href="erotic%20thriller">erotic thriller</a> "<a href="Mind%20Twister">Mind Twister</a>", directed by <a href="Fred%20Olen%20Ray">Fred Olen Ray</a> and for which Slater received <a href="billing%20%28filmmaking%29">top-billing</a>. She was suggested by Wynorski after lead actress <a href="Tanya%20Roberts">Tanya Roberts</a> dropped out of the project. The part called for lengthy <a href="Softcore%20pornography">softcore</a> sex scenes with her co-stars Erica Nann and Nels Van Patten, a first for Slater.

Shortly after the release of "Mind Twister", Slater suddenly retired from acting and disappeared from the public eye. Fellow "Chopping Mall" actress <a href="Barbara%20Crampton">Barbara Crampton</a> explained in 2016 that the two failed to keep in contact in the years following that film's release. The movie's staff had been unable to locate Slater, making her one of the few surviving cast members to not attend the 30th anniversary screening of "Chopping Mall".

Personal life.
Suzee Slater had a mother and brother, both of who moved out to California to be closer to her. Slater once dated screenwriter <a href="Stanley%20Weiser">Stanley Weiser</a>.

Military Police (Albania)

The Albanian Military Police (MP) () is a <a href="Provost%20%28military%20police%29">provost</a> independent branch of the <a href="Albanian%20Armed%20Forces">Albanian Armed Forces</a> responsible for the policing of service personnel, and for providing a <a href="military%20police">military police</a> presence both in Albania and while service personnel are deployed overseas on operations and exercises. The PU it is under the authority of <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Albania%29">Ministry of Defence</a>. Its tasks increase during wartime to include traffic control organisation and <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">POW</a> and <a href="refugee">refugee</a> control. The Military Police are distinguished from other units by their wearing of black uniform and the blue <a href="brassard">brassard</a> worn around the left upper arm, with the "MP" lettering in white, symbol of military police.

History.
After the fall of the 50-years <a href="Fall%20of%20communism%20in%20Albania">communist regime</a> of Albania, there was a need to reform the Armed Forces in all its pertinent structures. On 1 February 1992, the Military Police was established upon approval by Parliament of "Law No. 511, dated 08.08.1991, "On the Military Police in the Armed Forces of the Republic of Albania"". The purpose of this structure was to strengthen order and discipline in AAF and it was considered as an essential thing to transform the Army according to NATO countries’ standards.

With the creation of MP, the focus of its work was to control military vehicle traffic, maintenance of military rule in order to strengthen discipline in AF. In December 1994, attached to MP, were created the structures of "Criminal Police" and "Fire Fighting Service". In early 1995, the MP branch in General Staff was transformed into the MP directorate commanded by <a href="Brig.%20Gen.">Brig. Gen.</a> Bajram Malaj. Through legal support, regulations and its professionalism growing day by day, the MP ranked among the best units of the Armed Forces.

After the events of 1997, the MP Director was <a href="Col.">Col.</a> Piro Lutaj. It should be noted that after the events of 1997, MP had a tremendous growth on the basis of a project with the Italian Delegation of Experts (DIE). At that time, with the assistance of Italian specialists, for the first time, the MP battalion was created in <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a>, which was equipped with the necessary logistics and materials, and it was conceived according to <a href="Carabinieri">Italian Carabinieri</a> battalions. The establishment of MP battalion in Tirana marks a qualitative leap in the activity of this modern structure and the most qualitative of the time, which became apparent in the events of 1998, when the MP not only suffered any damage, but it defended several state institutions such as, the <a href="Radio%20Televizioni%20Shqiptar">Radio Televizioni Shqiptar</a>, <a href="Albtelecom">Albtelecom</a>, <a href="Prosecutor%20General%20%28Albania%29">General Prosecutor’s Office</a> and several international institutions.

Equipment of MP battalion in Tirana, with the necessary technique and armoured vehicles <a href="Iveco%20VM%2090">Iveco VM 90</a>, played a huge role in the events of 1998 in Albania. This structure played an undeniable role in 1999, during the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo crisis</a>, when it had the major role for the welcome, escorting and treatment of refugees at camps set up in <a href="Kuk%C3%ABs">Kukës</a>, <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a>, <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durrës</a> and other cities around the country, keeping under control the situation in the areas of <a href="Kuk%C3%ABs">Kukës</a>, <a href="Krum%C3%AB">Krumë</a>, <a href="Tropoj%C3%AB">Tropojë</a>, especially at border posts, solving many difficult situations, escorting convoys and personalities that travelled to north and back, as well as maintaining control of the road network across the country, especially in the north. The events of 1997, 1998 and the Kosovo crisis are the most important events in the history of MP.

In late 2000, with the suppression of the structure of the MP Directorate, by the Order of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Albania%29">Ministry of Defence</a> no. 1, dated 01.05.2001, “On the organization of the Military Police Regiment”, the Military Police Regiment was established and its commander was <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel">Lieutenant colonel</a> Namik Goga. This structure exercised its activity until September 2003, protecting and safeguarding all exercises that took place on the territory of the country. In September 2003, the MP structure was transformed into a battalion structure based in Tirana and its commander was Lieutenant colonel Xhevahir Avdia, who held this office until 2005. In 2005 the commander of the battalion was appointed Lieutenant colonel Drini Nikolla, who held this office until 2008.

In July 2007, the MP battalion became an organic part of the <a href="Support%20Command%20%28Albania%29">Support Command</a>, and its administrative management was subordinated to the Support Command, while its Operational Commanding was subordinated to the General Staff. Part of the battalion were four sections of MP in <a href="Shkod%C3%ABr">Shkodër</a>, <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durrës</a>, <a href="Berat">Berat</a>, <a href="Vlor%C3%AB">Vlorë</a> and five subsections of MP, in <a href="Kuk%C3%ABs">Kukës</a>, <a href="Burrel">Burrel</a>, <a href="Elbasan">Elbasan</a>, <a href="Korc%C3%AB">Korcë</a> and <a href="Gjirokast%C3%ABr">Gjirokastër</a>, where the sectors of Criminal Police, Judicial Police, vehicle traffic, Fire Fighting and Rescue conducted their activities.

In 2008, Colonel Xhevdet Zeneli became commander of the MP battalion. In May 2010, the structure of the Military Police was named Military Police of the Armed Forces in compliance with Law "No. 9069 dated 15.05.200, “On the Military Police of the Armed Forces"", and MP continues to have this structure nowadays.

During these years, MP is trained by the specialists of Italian Carabineers, U.S, German and Turkish military police.

For years, MP, through a special program, is preparing a sub-unit of platoon-level <a href="NATO%20Response%20Force">NRF</a> (NATO Response Force), a force ready to act as part of NATO relevant structure, capable and suitably equipped to perform such duties.

So far, around 50 people of Military Police have been part of different missions abroad, in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> and <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, in support of the Armed Forces and various international HQs. MP has also conducted a mission in “<a href="ISAF">ISAF</a>” military operation, in <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. This platoon consisted of 22 people.

Mission and Tasks.
Maintaining order in the <a href="Albanian%20Armed%20Forces">AAF</a>, detection, prevention and prosecution of criminal activity, engagement in the fight against terrorism, participation in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations and protection of state property managed and used by the Armed Forces.

Structure.
The Albanian MP structure, located in Tirana, consists of the following elements:


Equipment and Uniform.

Since 2013, the Military Police uses three uniforms, including the <a href="Army%20Combat%20Uniform">Combat-Uniform</a> (ACU), the <a href="Army%20Service%20Uniform">Service Uniform</a> (ASU) and the Ceremonial Uniform. Both of Service and Ceremonial uniforms are on black. The ACU usually it is the same pattern of the standard uniform of the <a href="Albanian%20Land%20Forces">Albanian Land Forces</a>, but together with the service uniform, it distinguishes from other militaries officers by a blue <a href="brassard">brassard</a> worn around the left upper arm, with the "MP" lettering in white. This patch is attached to the uniform by <a href="hook%20and%20loop%20fastener">hook and loop fastener</a>.

Weapons.
In the modernization programme of the <a href="Albanian%20Armed%20Forces">AAF</a>, particular attention was paid to the Military Police. To bring them up to NATO standards, current efforts focus on upgrading equipment and armaments, enhancing their operational effectiveness, and combat training. <br> Although the MP employs various individual weapons to provide light firepower at short ranges, the standard weapon used by the ground force is the <a href="Beretta%20ARX160">Beretta ARX160</a>, which since 2015 has entirely replaced <a href="AK-47">AK-47</a> variants. Also as the standard handgun, the MP uses <a href="Beretta%20PX4">Beretta PX4</a> <a href="9%C3%9719mm%20Parabellum">9×19mm Parabellum</a> which is widely used by all Albanian Armed Forces.<br> Support fire is provided by the <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch%20MG4">Heckler & Koch MG4</a> <a href="light%20machine%20gun">light machine gun</a> and the <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch%20MG5">Heckler & Koch MG5</a> <a href="general-purpose%20machine%20gun">general-purpose machine gun</a>. The most used sniper rifles are the <a href="Sako%20TRG">Sako TRG</a>-22 and TRG-44 to give the infantry a long-range weapon. The <a href="semi-automatic%20shotgun">semi-automatic shotgun</a> <a href="Benelli%20M4%20Super%2090">Benelli M4 Super 90</a> is used for door breaching and close-quarters combat. Hand grenades, fragmentation and smoke grenades along with the grenade launcher systems, such as the <a href="Beretta%20GLX%20160">GLX160</a>, are also used.

Vehicles.
Since late 90's, the Military Police mostly operates with two variants of the <a href="Iveco%20VM%2090">Iveco VM 90</a> military vehicle. The VM 90T "Torpedo used as transport vehicle and the VM 90P "Protetto which is used as armored vehicle for interventions in combat situations. However, the vehicle will remain in service until the completion of their lifecycle, since their replacement has started in 2015 in favor of <a href="Iveco%20LMV">Iveco LMV</a>.

In 2015, four <a href="Iveco%20LMV">Iveco LMV</a> armored vehicles were made available to the MP. These vehicles will serve to increase the technical and operational capacities of the Military Police missions and duties as well as to develop, complete and increase the operational level of the unit to perform difficult operations in high-risk areas and beyond.

Cannington Greyhounds

Cannington Greyhounds first race meeting was on the 12th December 1974. The eight race card drew more than 15,000 people to the new venue. The first race on the old venue was won by David Volo for trainer Sammy Blackburn in a time of 32.54. Cannington was one of the first tracks in Australia to switch to a sand based track this was completed in April 1989. The first meeting on the sand track was run on the 22nd of April 1989. The track's next upgrade was to an above ground lure system in January 2001, ready for a race meeting on the 21st of January 2001. Cannington has hosted the AGRA National Championships 6 times (1984, 1993, 1998, 2004, 2009, 2014) In total Western Australia has won The National Distance Championships twice with Paradise Street winning on home soil in 1998 and the great Miata winning in Hobart in 2012. Western Australia has been more successful in the National Sprint Championships winning 5 times (1978 Mr Toewhyte,1987 Fremantle Echo,1989 & 1990 Sandi's Me Mum and in 1997 Prince of Tigers.) Currently the track races every Wednesday and Saturday Night, Cannington also races during the summer with the closure of the Northam Greyhound track due to the increased heat in that region during the day. 
2015 Rebuild.
On June 27th the final race was held at the old Cannington venue with All Strung Out for Chris Halse winning the last race in a time of 30.72.

Baada

The Baada, also commonly called the "Bardi", are an <a href="indigenous%20Australian">indigenous Australian</a> people, living north of <a href="Broome%2C%20Western%20Australia">Broome</a> and inhabiting parts of the <a href="Dampier%20Peninsula">Dampier Peninsula</a> in the <a href="Kimberley%20region">Kimberley region</a> of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>.

Language.
The Baada language is a <a href="Pama-Nyungan%20languages">non-Pama-Nyungan</a> tongue,the most northerly variety of the <a href="Nyulnyulan%20language">Nyulnyulan language</a> family. It is mutually intelligible with <a href="Jawi%20language">Jawi</a>. It is the best known Nyulnyulan language, and a detailed grammar of the language exists, written by <a href="Claire%20Bowern">Claire Bowern</a>.

Country.
The Baada's traditional land, estimated by <a href="Norman%20Tindale">Norman Tindale</a> to encompass about , was in the <a href="Cape%20Leveque">Cape Leveque peninsula</a>, extending eastwards from Cape Borda to Cygnet Bay and Cunningham Point. There are problems with this estimate, in particular with the southern borders assigned to the Baada. The Kooljaman resort at Cape Leveque is run by Bardi people.

Social organization and economy.
The Baada were a maritime, coastal people, composed of 5 groups. They crafted pegged <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> ("tjulbu") logs ("tjulbu") from a light buoyant variety ("mandjilal") which they got in trade from the <a href="Djaui">Djaui</a> people of
<a href="Sunday%20Island%20%28King%20Sound%29">Sunday Island</a> to form rafts ("gaalwa") in order to venture out to the sea to hunt, and to visit the outlying islands.

As with the <a href="Djaui">Djaui</a>, the Baada defined land rights in terms of 4 kinds of relationship:

History of contact.
Norman Tindale thought that the Barda were perhaps those described by <a href="William%20Dampier">William Dampier</a>. Dampier arrived in the privateer <a href="Cygnet%20%28ship%29">"Cygnet"</a> off this coast on 5 January 1688, and remained there doing repairs until 12 March, This has been identified as, in all probability, Karakatta Bay in <a href="King%20Sound">King Sound</a>, now <a href="Bardi%2C%20Western%20Australia">One Arm Point</a>. The ancestors of the Baada were thus probably the first native Australian people described by Western explorers. A degree of confirmation of this inference emerged when Toby Metcalfe, a linguist who has studied the Baada language, suggested that Dampier's report of his encounter with the natives of the bay contained a word which was still recognizable from the Baada lexicon.
'At our first coming, before we were acquainted with them or they with us, a company of them who lived on the main came just against our ship, and, standing on a pretty high bank, threatened us with their swords and lances by shaking them at us: at last the captain ordered the drum to be beaten, which was done of a sudden with much vigour, purposely to scare the poor creatures. They hearing the noise ran away as fast as they could drive; and when they ran away in haste they would cry "Gurry, gurry," speaking deep in the throat.'

Metcalfe argued that, indisputably, the word repeated here, as transcribed as "gurri" was in fact "gnaarri," the "most feared and fickle" of the Baada malevolent spirit-beings. Thus, by an historical irony, it emerged that Dampier, who wrote down notoriously in his journal that the inhabitants of Baada territory were "the miserablest people in the world," was considered in turn by the Baada as the 'miserablest' and 'nastiest' of evil spirits.

The present.
The Bardi used to live on <a href="Sunday%20Island%20%28King%20Sound%29">Sunday Island</a> where a <a href="United%20Aborigines%20Mission">UAM</a> missionary, <a href="Wilfrid%20Douglas">Wilfrid Henry Douglas</a>, settled down in 1946, learning the Baada language and attempting to translate some passages in the New Testament into the local tongue.

Baada and Jawi peoples now live at One Arm Point, <a href="Djarindjin">Djarindjin</a> and <a href="Lombadina">Lombadina</a>.

Native title.
After a landmark 2002 <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court</a> decision confirmed the primacy of the <a href="Native%20Title%20Act">Native Title Act</a> of 1993, the Baada and Jawi people managed to obtain recognition of their native title claim in 2005, when a Federal Court under <a href="Robert%20French">Justice French</a> ruled that they were entitled to exclusive rights over some areas of the roughly to which they had laid claim. They also sought to claim a small section of Brue Reef, 31 miles north of Cape Leveque. Justice French ruled in June 2015 affirmed part of their claim, while adding they had non-exclusive native title rights over areas below the mean high water mark. The Brue Reef claim was dismissed.

Five Childhood Lyrics

Five Childhood Lyrics is a choral composition by <a href="John%20Rutter">John Rutter</a>, who set five texts, poems and <a href="nursery%20rhymes">nursery rhymes</a>, for four vocal parts (<a href="SATB">SATB</a> with some <a href="divisi">divisi</a>) <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>. Rutter composed the work for the London Concord Singers who first performed them in 1973.

The five movements are:

The first song is based on "<a href="Monday%27s%20Child">Monday's Child</a>", a fortune-telling song and <a href="nursery%20rhyme">nursery rhyme</a>. The text of the second song is "<a href="The%20Owl%20and%20the%20Pussycat">The Owl and the Pussycat</a>", a nonsense-poem by Edward Lear published in 1871. The third song is based on a poem by <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>. The text for the fourth song is "<a href="Matthew%2C%20Mark%2C%20Luke%20and%20John">Matthew, Mark, Luke and John</a>", a nursery rhyme and evening prayer. The fifth song uses the nursery rhyme "<a href="Sing%20a%20Song%20of%20Sixpence">Sing a Song of Sixpence</a>". The composer noted: "The Five Childhood lyrics are a kind of 'homage' to the world of children. I chose for my texts some of the rhymes and verses remembered from my earliest years, and set them to music as simply as I could—though the last of the five, which uses a familiar nursery tune, contains a certain amount of tongue-in-cheek elaboration." The music has been described by a reviewer for <a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a> as "delightful compositions", "brisk or thoughtful", then "more relaxed and indulgent". Another reviewer noted that "it’s wonderful to be reminded of the energy and sharp-witted invention that characterize these youthful pieces". The work was first published in 1974 by <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>.

The songs were recorded in a collection of Rutter's secular works titled "Fancies", performed under his direction by the <a href="Cambridge%20Singers">Cambridge Singers</a>, together with the summer songs of the same name, the winter songs "When Icicles Hang", and the instrumental "<a href="Suite%20Antique">Suite Antique</a>". They were recorded in 2002 on an album with secular music by Rutter, with <a href="Nicol%20Matt">Nicol Matt</a> conducting the Nordic Chamber Choir.

Xero (demo tape)

Xero is the self-titled 1997 demo tape by American band Xero (now known as Linkin Park). The tape is the first publicly released work by the band and contains their earliest known recordings.

Background.
When Mike Shinoda was 15, a friend’s dad chaperoned them to a Anthrax and Public Enemy show during Anthrax' "Attack Of The Killer B's" tour in 1991.
He was so inspired by the musical melding that when he decided to form his own group, he wrote with both rhymes and rhythms in mind.

Mike took piano lessons until he was about 13, starting when he was about 6 years old. At this age, he ended up wanting to go in a direction (hip hop / production, jazz, blues) that his teacher, Eileen, wasn't familiar with, so he left. He bought some production equipment (a keyboard and then a sampler with the help of Styles Of Beyond's producer Vin Skully) and started making beats and playing with MIDI and digital-based music. The beats were inspired by old-school rock & roll or blues songs and he eventually started rapping over them. For the most part, he made a lot of Gangsta rap joke songs, resulting in a demo tape called <a href="List%20Of%20Unreleased%20Songs%23Pooch%20Pound">Pooch Pound</a>.

When he was 8 or 9 years old, Rob Bourdon and his brother used to play along to Aerosmith and Faith No More on their parents couch with a pair of drumsticks. Later his brother got a drum kit and Rob started playing piano. When he was 12, he started taking drum lessons and switched to playing drums full time. He was inspired to play the drums after his mom took him to an Aerosmith concert and introduced him to Joey Kramer (Aerosmith's drummer).
In 6th grade Rob started playing in a band with 3 friends called No Clue, that would play cover songs in backyard parties. In 7th grade they switched their name to Physical Evidence and covered Nirvana, Bad Religion and Suicidal Tendencies. When they started writing their own original music, the songs sounded like a blend of those 3 different artists, with most of the lyrics being about the teachers they hated in their junior high school. When he was in the 10th grade his parents made him join in his high school's jazz band (the Calabasas High School Jazz Band). He was in the band for a couple of months and played one show, but he didn't like it. In the audience, two musicians who were contemplating forming a new band called Karma saw Rob performing and recruited him to audition. He didn't get the job, but through the bass player of Karma he met Brad Delson and Mike Shinoda who both lived nearby in the San Fernando Valley.

Brad has been interested in music as far back as he can remember. He played trumpet in his elementary school orchestra, and started learning to play guitar when he was 12 or 13, taking lessons for about 5 years before he started teaching guitar and playing with friends in local bands. He was neighbors with Mark Wakefield in highschool and the two of them were in a band called The Pricks.

Mark, Brad and Rob, along with the bass player from Karma then started a band called <a href="List%20Of%20Unreleased%20Songs%23Relative%20Degree">Relative Degree</a>. They had a dream of playing one show at The Roxy Theatre, where Brad worked as a bouncer, so they set it as their big goal. The Roxy was a popular club for up and coming bands located on Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood, California. The band wrote 12 songs and rehearsed for a year before playing the show at The Roxy which finally happened on May 17, 1996.

Brad said, ""People laugh at me when I say this but my goal was - as a musician - to play a show at our local club, the Roxy, in L.A. in high school for my friends. I did it. Now I say this, and it may sound like bullshit, everything that's happened from that point on is all gravy. We're really proud of the music we've made, and for everyone that gets to hear it, that's more love for us. We're totally happy."" After playing only one show, the members of Relative Degree started losing focus and the band eventually broke up.

Although Mike never joined the band, he would occasionally put samples into their songs and watch them practice, and developed a strong friendship with Brad when they were both in 8th grade.

Still in his development stage of rapping, Mike used to record demos with Ryu of Styles Of Beyond in his bedroom. He would later design Styles Of Beyond's original logo and produce an unreleased version of "<a href="List%20Of%20Unreleased%20Songs%23Marco%20Polo%20%28Mike%20Shinoda%20Version%29">Marco Polo</a>" for the album "2000 Fold". He would also create album art for DJ Frane's "Fantastic Boatride" and Saukrates' "The Underground Tapes" as well as for the Styles Of Beyond album.

Mike and Mark have been friends since they were 12 and used to make funny songs together. They went to high school together and after both graduated, they started a new band called "Xero" in the winter of 1995/1996. At that point, Mike was mainly doing beats for various hip hop acts (and for himself as well), but decided he wanted to experiment with mixing different styles of music together. After one or two writing sessions, they enlisted the help of Brad and recorded a demo containing 4 songs with a few of them having guitars done by him. They sent it to an A&R representative from an indie label/publishing company whose mailing address was included in one of the CDs they owned and got a phone call from Paul, the representative, a day later asking them to come over. He was shocked to learn the duo recorded a professional sounding demo on a 4-track in Mike's bedroom and encouraged them to put a band together and start playing shows. They set their first goal to play at the Whisky A Go Go and the demo tape was eventually passed out to friends and new fans and sent out to record companies to try and get signed.

Brad was in his first year of college, studying communications at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), when he attended to a class taught by Jeff Blue, who had just signed Korn and Limp Bizkit. Jeff was also developing a young woman named Macy Gray and told everybody in the class he was looking for an intern to help build her career, and help him showcase artists, and Brad volunteered for the job.
The next morning, Jeff walked in his office and his sister told him there was some kid waiting to speak to him, even though he had no appointments. He then saw Brad spinning on Jeff's seat. Jeff told Brad to don't ever sit in his seat again and asked him to talk about himself. He told Jeff about his dream of becoming a lawyer and about his band that he was developing. Brad then pointed to a big Limp Bizkit poster Jeff had in his office, which he was really proud of, and said ""That band is not that great. I may have a band that's better than that."" Jeff liked his confidence and hired Brad as his intern. Funny enough, DJ Lethal of Limp Bizkit would later help Linkin Park by giving Mike music plugins, adive and sounds.

After the end of Relative Degree, Rob went through a rough period in his life, struggling with drugs and alchool, and became isolated from everyone. Towards the end of high school, he got his life back on track and went back into playing drums full time again. Around that time, he got a call from Mike asking if he wanted to listen to some songs he had written with Brad and Mark. He was impressed by their work and became involved right away.

Dave Farrell's older brother, Joe, started playing cello in fourth grade. Dave wanted to learn it too, but the cello was too big for a first-grader, so he started playing violin instead. He did a classical training for eight years and in the process learned a bit of cello and viola. In the beginning of high school, his mom showed him the basics on a guitar, and from there he picked up a bass.
In college, Dave entered UCLA as a biology major (pre-med), but finished as a philosophy major with a minor in classical Greek.
He was a college roommate of guitarist Brad Delson and the duo were playing small jazz events together. Dave had been excited about the progression Brad had been making with his high school friends in Xero, so when the opportunity arose, he joined the band.

Since the beginning, the band knew they would need a DJ in order to perform their songs live, but the DJ would need to be someone who could handle more than just scratches.
Mike met Joseph Hahn when both were studying illustration at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. They had similar interests and shared a love for music, especially hip hop. Because of how expensive the school was, Joe only went there for about a year before he started working as a Special Effects designer/illustrator, dealing primarily with character design and storyboarding for television and movies such as "Phantoms", "Virus", "Sphere", "X-Files", "Dune", "The Outer Limits", and "Species". A couple years after their initial meeting, Mike approached Joe about a project named Xero.
Like Mike and Dave, Joe had been a classically trained musician and brought new capacities for sounds to the band.
Joe played violin in school for a few years and then played guitar for a bit before he started getting serious about DJ-ing in high school. He says, ""Around high school I loved music, hip-hop and all the stuff going on in KROQ back when people listened to the radio. I was DJing and I got into scratching and all that. The idea of a sound wave on a record and being able to manipulate it with speed and turning the volume up and down and having that turn into something totally different was really new and experimental at the time. I love the idea of just twisting sounds and manipulating beats; the idea of distortion and where that can go and how powerful sounds can be.""

Xero played their first shows as a band on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, with the first one taking place on November 14, 1997 at the Whisky A Go Go, playing before SX-10 and System Of A Down. Mike said, ""I remember that gig. I was wearing the most ridiculous thing ever. I had this white beanie hat on with blue goggles and white gloves, I think because it made me feel more like a performer and not the normal dude that I knew I was. So I had to get into costume in order to get psyched up and get into character. We were awful, just horrible but we survived.""
The club was packed with A&R scouts that had all fled by the third song. Jeff Blue said, ""The place was empty. You could hear crickets."" However, he saw that the group had potential but were pretty far from actually "making it", so he gave them a development deal with a little financial support from Zomba Music Group. With the help of a publishing company, the self-managed band was able to buy new instruments and equipment, get a decent recording and a better show.

Mike said, ""We would write a lot more than we played. A lot of bands rush their songs, and go out and play a ton of shows; we spent weeks and weeks on the music, and probably only played one or two shows a month.""
Dave added, ""We definitely weren’t polished but we had a lot of potential. We only really played shows as an excuse to get our friends together for a party afterwards. In the early stages, it wasn’t about getting a record deal. But the more we played, the more we realised we might have a chance."" It was at one of those after show parties in February 1998 at Brad and Dave's apartment that Mark Wakefield introduced Mike to his friend Anna Hillinger (Mike's future wife) from Long Beach.

Xero played several shows after this to mostly empty venues with almost no one in attendance. The sets consisted of around six to eight songs and were 25-30 minutes long. The public was mostly there just to support friends. Local bands like Incubus, Hoobustank (now Hoobastank) and Xero would attend each other's shows. Andy Gould (whose management company would later work with Linkin Park) recalls watching Xero play at The Roxy Theatre in front of 10 people.

In 1998, Joe worked at the Urban Network magazine where both him and Mike contributed with artwork and original Xero songs for Lee Cadena's "Rapology" compilation series which promoted new and upcoming hip-hop artists. Cadena founded LCM, his own artist management and development company, and worked with Xero introducing them to music venues such as Whisky A Go Go, The Troubadour and The Mint. He also helped Joe improving his skills by getting him with some of the Beat Junkies.

At some point in 1998, the band would go by the name "Xero 818", 818 being one of the area codes for the San Fernando Valley area, which is where the band is from. By the end of the year, Mark left the band and joined System Of A Down's manager David "Beno" Benveniste on the Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group. Beno was also the founder of Streetwise, a marketing company which would later help Linkin Park building their street team.

Dave would soon leave Xero too. He was also committed to another band, Tasty Snax, with whom he had been close friends with since high school. They released their debut album, "<a href="Run%20Joseph%20Run">Run Joseph Run</a>", in 1998 and when they left on tour, Dave went with them. They would release a second studio album, "<a href="Snax">Snax</a>", in 2000 and break up in the following year. Their vocalist, <a href="Mark%20Fiore">Mark Fiore</a>, would later become Linkin Park's videographer.

Writing and Recording.
The songs were mostly written by Mike Shinoda and Mark Wakefield in 1996, with Brad Delson and Joe Hahn also being credited for "<a href="Rhinestone">Rhinestone</a>".

"Fuse" features a sample of "The Very Long Fuse", a story narrated by Laura Olsher on Disneyland Records' 1964 album "Chilling, Thrilling Sounds Of The Haunted House".

On "<a href="Stick%20N%20Move">Stick N Move</a>", Mike did a reference to "Check The Rhime" by A Tribe Called Quest.

The demo was recorded in 1997 in a makeshift studio set up in Mike's bedroom with gear he had been collecting one by one, starting when he was about 13 years old. The songs were recorded straight to tape on a Tascam Porta 07, a little 4 track recorder, without any live drums. Mike would record on three of those tracks and bounce the recordings to the 4th, then record over the initial 3. The final products would be bounced out to a separate cassette recorder. Since nothing touched the computer, no master digital files exist for these exact versions of these four songs.

Guitars were played on a Fender Strat guitar (Mark's first and only guitar) with a Crate G20 Amp. A Yamaha PSR 510 was used for keyboards, mostly bass. All vocals were recorded with a Shure SM58 microphone. A Roland MS 1 (that played up to 4 samples and was meant to be played by hand) and an Akai S900 (a 12 bit sampler that saved on floppy disks) samplers were also used. Since those samplers didn't have an internal sequencer, Mike used an Alesis HR 16 drum machine as his sequencer.

On the band's influences at the time, Mike said, ""in our most rudimentary version of our band back in 1997, our earliest demos sounded like the Roots meets Alice In Chains meets Aphex Twin or Prodigy or something. It was all stuff that we were currently listening to that was kind of current at the time. Those were our earliest demos. Over time we just simply started listening to more stuff.""

Releases.
There were two issues of the Xero tape, both with the same tracks but different covers. The black and white shopping cart was the first issue and is very rare, having a small number of copies made. 

Only one known copy of the shopping cart version exists in the current Linkin Park community, owned by "JomJom" / Giorgio from Italy. According to BPercy from LPCatalog, ""A lot of people thought it wasn't legit until Mike confirmed it was legit at a meet and greet in Europe before A Thousand Suns was released. My buddy Giorgio from Italy owns it and showed Mike and asked him. Giorgio and myself actually started the first catalog in 2005 (known as lpcollectors.com) and ran it for a couple years. Then life got in the way. Mike Shinoda told him, the shopping cart was actually a joke for a cover for the demo tape but then they actually had some made before the baby version was made.. If I remember he implied fewer were made. Most hardcore LP fans know how rare a Xero tape is. Try and find one for sale (needle in hay stack.) Now the shopping cart version is like a needle in outer space in my opinion. There might be 2 or 3 in existence that didn't get tossed.""

This version was apparently a joke between Mike and Joe, who said while in a grocery store that the first release they had would be of a shopping cart. In 2003 or 2004, a second shopping cart version was listed on eBay and known collectors were outbid; the buyer has never surfaced in the community. To date, only JomJom's, Anna Shinoda's, and the mysterious eBay auction's tapes have been the only three confirmed to exist outside of possible copies that the band still might have.

When JomJom showed his shopping cart version of the tape to Linkin Park in 2008, they proposed adding "<a href="Reading%20My%20Eyes">Reading My Eyes</a>" to that night's setlist for him. While Chester said no, this was the first time that Mike decided to rap a verse of "Reading My Eyes" over "<a href="Bleed%20It%20Out">Bleed It Out</a>" (<a href="http%3A//lplive.net/shows/db/2008/20080620">Heineken Jammin' Italy, 2008</a>).

After the shopping cart issue, a version with a blue cover featuring a baby was made and is now most the most commonly associated cover when referring to Xero and the tape. More copies of this version were made, and these are the source for the current rips of the tape circulating online. No rip of the shopping cart version has been made, but due to JomJom's copy, we are able to confirm that the tracks on both issues are the same exact versions. While more copies with the blue cover were made, only a few of these are also known to exist in the Linkin Park collectors community, outside of the band.

The shopping cart version of the tape was confirmed to have been made in 1997. According to Anna Shinoda's story of meeting Mike after a Xero show in February 1998 and Mike handing her a shopping cart version of the tape, fans have speculated that the blue cover version could have possibly been made in 1998 after this meeting. No more information on the subject is available.





Cassette Tape Rips.
Over the years, the owners and collectors of the Xero tapes have attempted different transfers of the four songs. The first existing rip was done by IDX on April 29, 2002 and was commonplace in the community for many years, but lacked bass and was very treble-driven. It also noticeably had a skip in "Stick N Move" at 1:05 in the first chorus. Since then, several Xero tapes have made their way into hands of collectors and other rips have been released as both time has gone on and technology has improved.

As of now, there are three known, circulating rips of the Xero tape, with the third rip getting two remasters in 2011.

It is important to note that all of the known rips have come from the tape featuring the blue cover with the baby, and no rips have ever been made of the shopping cart cover tape.

+ Skittle021's second remaster of nkramar's rip "("Garage Days Unleashed" - 2011)"<br>

For four years, fans were only able to hear the first rip by IDX. The LPFuse rerip in 2006 is bassy and muffled-sounding, but it was the first time fans were able to hear the full version of "Stick N Move" without the cut in the first chorus.

LPA's news post from 2007 for nkramar's release read, ""Tonight we are proud to present to you, a series of brand new high quality rips of Linkin Park's very first demo tape (provided courtesy of nkramar), from back when they were originally known as Xero. These rips are some of the best to surface on the internet to date as they came from a mint condition Xero tape, played only a limited number of times, before landing into the hands of its current and rightful owner, who was courteous enough to provide new rips for all of you to hear.""

In 2011, a remaster of nkramar's rip was released by community member Skittle021, saying, ""I would like to share something that I have been working on for the past three years. Since late 2007, I have been working on remastering the Xero Demo Tape to get it as close to studio quality as possible. Well, I've finally done it. I wasn't planning on releasing this to the public, but after showing it to a few friends and family members, they suggested that I do just that. So, here you go. Let me know what you think!""

Later unsatisfied with his work, Skittle021 worked on a second remaster, released in late 2011 and called "Garage Days Unleashed", which comes with the description, ""The newly remaster version of the Xero Tape. This version contains many major improvements over the last version. Garage Days: Unleashed contains absolutely no filtering, of any kind. Previous versions of the tape contained very, very heavy noise and essing filters, but this time the sound is completely natural. The tape has now been remastered in full stereo using a completely different new method. This version still eliminates all signs of hissing or buzzing that is caused by ripping a cassette, but completely preserves all of the original backing vocals and instruments""

As time goes on, the tapes will age and slowly deteriorate, so it is likely that the best possible rips of it have already occurred and been released to fans. Only a few known copies exist with current Linkin Park collectors, as most have been lost over time.

Other Songs.
Other than the 4 tracks on the demo tape, Xero wrote and recorded more songs as a band.

"<a href="Rhinestone">Rhinestone</a>" was re-recorded at some point when Mark was still in the band and used on the soundtrack of the 20th episode of the Canadian TV show "The Crow: Stairway to Heaven", entitled "Brother's Keeper", which aired on May 7, 1999.
A soundtrack CD for the series exists but "Rhinestone" wasn't included in it.

Three Xero tracks named "Closing", "Drop" and "Fiends" were featured on Urban Network Magazine's hip-hop compilation series "Rapology" in 1998.

On "<a href="Hybrid%20Theory">Hybrid Theory</a>", "<a href="A%20Place%20For%20My%20Head">A Place For My Head</a>" credits Mark Wakefield because the original incarnation of its demo, "Esaul", was written by Xero. Additionally, "<a href="Hybrid%20Theory">Forgotten</a>" was rewritten from Xero's "Rhinestone" and "<a href="Runaway%20%28Linkin%20Park%20song%29">Runaway</a>" originated from elements of "<a href="Stick%20N%20Move">Stick N Move</a>". On the album, a demo of "Stick N Move" was released with the date of 1998.

The unreleased song "<a href="Pictureboard">Pictureboard</a>" is listed on the BMI song database and credits Mark Wakefield and the rest of the band as well as Chester Bennington. It was later re-recorded by Hybrid Theory (which is why Chester is credited as well) but no versions have ever been released. Hybrid Theory performed the song once, according to Mike.

In November 2010, Linkin Park released a Xero instrumental entitled "<a href="Coal">Coal</a>" on the "" album. The song was dated with the year 1997.

The song "<a href="Slip">Slip</a>" on the "<a href="LP%20Underground%20Eleven">LP Underground Eleven</a>" album credits Mark Wakefield as songwriter, which means it was first created as a Xero song.

"<a href="LP%20Underground%2015">LP Underground 15</a>" contains a three-movement "stream of consciousness" art piece created by Mike Shinoda in 1998 while in college, called "Pods".

An LPU 12 video exclusive entitled "<a href="List%20Of%20Unreleased%20Songs%23%26quot%3BXero%20Reborn%26quot%3B">Perth Jam 1, Xero Reborn</a>" from the Perth, Australia Soundwave show in 2013 featured Phoenix playing a guitar part backstage that Mike and Chester referred to as being an old Xero demo. Chester said that he sang on it and it was a demo they worked on and Mike said that it didn't make it past being a demo and it was "terrible". The song title is unknown.

Kónya Szécsényi

Kónya Szécsényi (or "Konya"; , ; died 1367), was a Hungarian baron, who served as <a href="Ban%20of%20Croatia%20and%20Dalmatia">Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia</a> from 1366 till his death, during the reign of King <a href="Louis%20I%20of%20Hungary">Louis I of Hungary</a>.

Life.
His birth name was Nicholas, but contemporaries (even in official documents) exclusively called him "Kónya" after his drooping ears (lit. "lekonyuló"). He was born into the powerful <a href="Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi%20family">Szécsényi family</a> as the eldest son of <a href="Thomas%20Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi">Thomas Szécsényi</a>, <a href="Voivode%20of%20Transylvania">Voivode of Transylvania</a> and his first wife, an unidentified daughter of nobleman Paul Visontai from the <a href="Aba%20%28genus%29">"gens" Aba</a>. His brothers were prelate <a href="Michael%20Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi">Michael</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20V%C3%A1c">Bishop of Vác</a> then <a href="Bishop%20of%20Eger">Eger</a>, and Stephen, who was mentioned only once in 1331. After their mother's death, Thomas Szécsényi married to Anne, Duchess of Auschwitz. The marriage produced further three children, but all of them (Kónya's half-siblings: Caspar, Ladislaus I and Anne) died in their childhood.

Kónya first appeared in contemporary documents as a young courtier in 1327, when he already served as Master of the stewards for <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Poland%2C%20Queen%20of%20Hungary">Queen Elizabeth</a>, spouse of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Hungary">Charles I of Hungary</a>. Despite his court function, he was not present on 17 April 1330, when <a href="Felician%20Z%C3%A1h">Felician Záh</a>, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. However Kónya Szécsényi's "<a href="Familiaris">familiar</a>", deputy master <a href="John%20Cselenfi">John Cselenfi</a> stabbed the assassin and the arriving royal guards killed Felician. Szécsényi functioned as Master of the stewards in the Queen's Court until 1340.

He became a staunch supporter of Louis I, who ascended the throne in 1342 after his father's death. The king's mother Elizabeth "acted as a sort of co-regent" for decades, because she exerted a powerful influence on him, which also resulted her courtier Szécsényi's growing influence. He actively participated in the <a href="Neapolitan%20campaigns%20of%20Louis%20the%20Great">Neapolitan campaigns of Louis the Great</a>, residing in Italy for years. He was involved in the siege of <a href="Corato">Corato</a>, leading a garrison composed of Hungarian and "Lombard" soldiers. He served as "<a href="isp%C3%A1n">ispán</a>" of <a href="S%C3%A1ros%20County">Sáros</a> and <a href="Szepes%20County">Szepes</a> Counties from 1346 to 1349, and of <a href="N%C3%B3gr%C3%A1d%20County%20%28former%29">Nógrád County</a> from 1346 to 1350 (also possessing Szanda Castle as its "honor"). He was mentioned as castellan of <a href="%C4%8Cachtice%20Castle">Csejte Castle</a> (today Čachtice in <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>) in 1354. Between 1354 and 1360, he served as "ispán" of <a href="G%C3%B6m%C3%B6r%20County">Gömör County</a> and castellan of Fülek Castle (today in <a href="Fi%C4%BEakovo">Fiľakovo</a>, Slovakia). He was made "ispán" of <a href="Pozsony%20County">Pozsony County</a>, holding the dignity from 1360 to 1362. He finished his career as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, serving in this capacity from 1366 until his death in the next year.

Kónya Szécsényi married Elizabeth Haschendorfer, a daughter of Austrian noble Wulfing I Haschendorfer from Haschendorf/Hasfalva (today part of <a href="Neckenmarkt">Neckenmarkt</a> in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>). After her brother Wulfing II was killed in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Zadar%20%281345%E2%80%9346%29">Siege of Zadar</a> (1346) and left no male heirs, King Louis <a href="Prefection">granted the status of a son</a> to Elizabeth in 1347, authorizing her to inherit her father's landed property. As a result of this, Szécsényi acquired the castle of <a href="Ecseg">Ecseg</a> and other estates through his wife, which after then belonged to the <a href="Holl%C3%B3k%C5%91">Hollókő</a> lordship (and soon it was demolished by the Szécsényis themselves). The couple had three sons: <a href="Frank%20Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi">Frank</a>, Nicholas I and <a href="Simon%20Sz%C3%A9cs%C3%A9nyi">Simon</a>. Frank and Simon became notable barons during the reign of <a href="Sigismund%20of%20Luxembourg">Sigismund of Luxembourg</a>, who continued to expand family wealth and held important dignities, while Nicholas, who owned the village of <a href="Cered">Cered</a>, was last mentioned in 1383, possibly died around that year.

He failed to recover fully from an injury sustained in the <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a> and was retired to become a breeding stallion in Germany.

Background.
Jukebox Jury is a grey horse bred in Ireland by Paul Nataf. As a <a href="yearling%20%28horse%29">yearling</a> in August, the colt (then officially described as <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a>) was sent to the Arqana sale at <a href="Deauville">Deauville</a> where he was bought for €270,000 by the trainer <a href="Mark%20Johnston%20%28racehorse%20trainer%29">Mark Johnston</a>. The colt subsequently entered the ownership of Alan Spence and was taken into training with Johnston at his <a href="Middleham">Middleham</a> stable.

He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by <a href="Montjeu">Montjeu</a> whose wins included the <a href="Prix%20du%20Jockey%20Club">Prix du Jockey Club</a>, <a href="Irish%20Derby">Irish Derby</a>, <a href="Prix%20de%20l%27Arc%20de%20Triomphe">Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe</a> and <a href="King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20Stakes">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes</a>. As a breeding stallion his other progeny included <a href="Motivator%20%28horse%29">Motivator</a>, <a href="Authorized%20%28horse%29">Authorized</a>, <a href="Pour%20Moi">Pour Moi</a>, <a href="Camelot%20%28horse%29">Camelot</a>, <a href="Scorpion%20%28horse%29">Scorpion</a>, <a href="Hurricane%20Fly">Hurricane Fly</a>, <a href="St%20Nicholas%20Abbey%20%28horse%29">St Nicholas Abbey</a> and <a href="Hurricane%20Run">Hurricane Run</a>. Jukebox Jury's dam Mare Aux Fees, from whom he inherited his grey coat, showed no racing ability but did better as a broodmare, producing several other winners including the <a href="Prix%20Vanteaux">Prix Vanteaux</a> winner Belle Allure. She came from a largely French family which had produced several good winners including Tropique (<a href="Eclipse%20Stakes">Eclipse Stakes</a>), Lightning (<a href="Prix%20d%27Ispahan">Prix d'Ispahan</a>) and Soleil Noir (<a href="Grand%20Prix%20de%20Paris">Grand Prix de Paris</a>).

Racing career.
2008: two-year-old season.
Jukebox Jury began his racing career in a seven <a href="furlong">furlong</a> <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> at <a href="Goodwood%20Racecourse">Goodwood Racecourse</a> on 2 August in which he was ridden by <a href="Johnny%20Murtagh">Johnny Murtagh</a> and started a <a href="Fractional%20odds">14/1</a> outsider. After racing towards the rear of the field he made progress on the outside, caught the leaders in the closing stages and won by a neck despite looking "green" (inexperienced) and hanging right near the finish. Fifteen days later the colt was sent to France and moved up in class for the Listed Prix Francois Boutin over 1400 metres at <a href="Deauville%20Racecourse">Deauville Racecourse</a> and finished fourth, seven <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a> behind the <a href="Richard%20Hannon%20Sr.">Richard Hannon Sr.</a>-trained Soul City after hanging left in the last 200 metres. He returned to France on 7 September for the <a href="Group%20races">Group 3</a> <a href="Prix%20La%20Rochette">Prix La Rochette</a> at <a href="Longchamp%20Racecourse">Longchamp</a> in which he was again matched against Soul City. He was again beaten by the Hannon colt but produced a much better as he stayed on well to take third place, half a length and three quarters of a length behind Soul City and Milanais.

The Group 2 Royal Lodge Stakes at <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Ascot Racecourse</a> saw Jukebox Jury start the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind <a href="Cityscape%20%28horse%29">Cityscape</a>, Orizaba (winner of the <a href="Vintage%20Stakes">Vintage Stakes</a>) and the <a href="Henry%20Cecil">Henry Cecil</a>-trained On Our Way. After being restrained at the rear of the field in the early stages by his jockey Royston Ffrench the colt began to make progress approaching the final turn and was switched to the outside to make his challenge in the straight. He caught Cityscape 30 yards fron the finish and won by three quarters of a length. Ffrench was again in the saddle when the colt was stepped up to Group 1 class and started 2/1 favourite for the <a href="Racing%20Post%20Trophy">Racing Post Trophy</a> at <a href="Doncaster%20Racecourse">Doncaster</a> on 25 October. He stayed on well in the straight but was hampered a furlong from the finish and was beaten into second place by <a href="Crowded%20House%20%28horse%29">Crowded House</a>.

2009: three-year-old season.
Jukebox Jury missed the spring of 2009 and made little impact on his seasonal debut when he finished last of seven in the <a href="Prix%20Daphnis">Prix Daphnis</a> over 1800 metres at Longchamp on 22 June. In a strongly contested edition of the <a href="Eclipse%20Stakes">Eclipse Stakes</a> on 4 July he started a 50/1 outsider and came home sixth of the ten runners behind <a href="Sea%20The%20Stars">Sea The Stars</a>. In August the colt was dropped back to Group 3 class for the Rose of Lancaster Stakes at <a href="Haydock%20Park">Haydock Park</a> and started 6/1 fourth choice in the betting. He was among the early leaders before being pulled back by Ffrench and then renewing his challenge in the straight. He overtook the favourite <a href="Campanologist%20%28horse%29">Campanologist</a> inside the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths with the <a href="John%20Gosden">John Gosden</a>-trained <a href="Duncan%20%28horse%29">Duncan</a> taking third place.

Ten days after his win at Haydock Jukebox Jury contested the <a href="Great%20Voltigeur%20Stakes">Great Voltigeur Stakes</a> over one and a half miles at <a href="York%20Racecourse">York Racecourse</a> and finished fourth behind Monitor Closely, <a href="Mastery%20%28horse%29">Mastery</a> and Father Time after stumbling a quarter of a mile from the finish. The colt was back in action less than two weeks later in France when he contested the Grand Prix de Deauville against older horses and started at odds of 9/4 against five opponents including Ideal World (<a href="Prix%20de%20Reux">Prix de Reux</a>) and <a href="Kasbah%20Bliss">Kasbah Bliss</a> (<a href="Prix%20Gladiateur">Prix Gladiateur</a>). Jukebox Jury took the early lead and then settled in second behind Kasbah Bliss before regaining the avantage 300 metres from home. He just held off a late challenge from Pouvoir Absolu to prevail by a nose in a <a href="photo%20finish">photo finish</a>. Johnston commented "It wasn't the idea to make the running and Jukebox Jury is not the ideal horse for it, so we were delighted when Kasbah Bliss went on. We have had our eyes on the <a href="Canadian%20International%20Stakes">Canadian International</a> since he won at Haydock, but for the moment we'll keep all our options open".

Jukebox Jury was moved up to Group 1 level when he was sent to Germany for the Preis von Europa over 2400 metres at <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> on 27 September in which he again faced older opponents. He was made joint-favourite with the <a href="Sheema%20Classic">Sheema Classic</a> winner Eastern Anthem just ahead of the <a href="Hardwicke%20Stakes">Hardwicke Stakes</a> winner Bronze Cannon with the best of the others appearing to be Toughness Danon (<a href="Furstenberg-Rennen">Furstenberg-Rennen</a>), Enroller (<a href="John%20Porter%20Stakes">John Porter Stakes</a>) and Eliot (fourth in the <a href="German%20Derby">German Derby</a>). The colt started quickly before settling in second place behind Enroller and then went to the front 400 metres from the finish. Eastern Anthem produced a sustained effort but Jukebox Jury prevailed by a nose with a gap of two and a half lengths back to Eliot in third place.

For his final run of the season, as Johnston had predicted, Jukebox Jury was sent to Canada for the Pattison Canadian International at <a href="Woodbine%20Racetrack">Woodbine Racetrack</a> on 17 October. Ridden as usual by Ffrench he raced in second place before taking the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten half a length by the six-year-old <a href="Champs%20Elysees%20%28horse%29">Champs Elysees</a>.

In the <a href="2009%20World%20Thoroughbred%20Rankings">2009 World Thoroughbred Rankings</a> Jukebox Jury was given a rating of 118, makng him the 87th best rcehorse in the world and the best British three-year-old colt in the Long distance division.

2010: four-year-old season.
In early 2010 Jukebox Jury was sent to <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a> for the <a href="Sheema%20Classic">Sheema Classic</a> at <a href="Meydan%20Racecourse">Meydan Racecourse</a> on 27 March in which he finished fifteenth of the sixteen runners behind <a href="Dar%20Re%20Mi">Dar Re Mi</a> after fading badly in the straight. On his return to Europe he conteted the Jockey Club Stakes over one and a half miles at <a href="Newmarket%20Racecourse">Newmarket Racecourse</a> on 1 May and started the 13/8 favourite against four opponents, namely Claremont (<a href="Prix%20du%20Lys">Prix du Lys</a>), Nanton (Mallard Stakes), Drill Sergeant (<a href="Duke%20of%20Edinburgh%20Stakes">Duke of Edinburgh Stakes</a>) and Halicarnassus (<a href="Bosphorus%20Cup">Bosphorus Cup</a>). After racing in second place behind Drill Sergeant, Ffrench sent Jukebox Jury to the front with half a mile left and the colt kept on well to win by almost four lengths from Nanton.

Jukebox Jury was well beaten in his next two races, finishing seventh to <a href="Fame%20and%20Glory">Fame and Glory</a> in the <a href="Coronation%20Cup">Coronation Cup</a> and ninth to <a href="Harbinger%20%28horse%29">Harbinger</a> in the <a href="Hardwicke%20Stakes">Hardwicke Stakes</a>. When sent to Germany for the <a href="Deutschland%20Preis">Deutschland Preis</a> at Hamburg on 17 July he produced a better effort as he finished fourth to Campanologist, beaten less than a length by the winner.

The <a href="2010%20World%20Thoroughbred%20Rankings">2010 World Thoroughbred Rankings</a> saw Jukebox Jury drop to 178 in the rankings with a mark of 116.

2011: five-year-old season.
After an absence of more than eleven months, Jukebox Jury returned in the Listed Fred Archer Stakes at Newmarket on 25 June in which he was ridde for the first time by <a href="Neil%20Callan">Neil Callan</a>. The <a href="Grand%20Prix%20de%20Paris">Grand Prix de Paris</a> winner Cavalryman started favourite with Jukebox Jury starting at odds of 11/2 in an eight-runner field which also included Allied Powers (<a href="Grand%20Prix%20de%20Chantilly">Grand Prix de Chantilly</a>) and Afsare (<a href="Hampton%20Court%20Stakes">Hampton Court Stakes</a>). In a change of tactics, he led from the start and stayed to win by three quarters of a length from Cavalryman and Afsare who dead-heated for second place. 

In the <a href="Glorious%20Stakes">Glorious Stakes</a> at <a href="Goodwood%20Racecourse">Goodwood Racecourse</a> a month later Jukebox Jury partially recovered after being boxed against the inside rail to finish third, beaten a head and a neck by Drunken Sailor and Harris Tweed. In an exceptionally strong renewal of the Prix Kergorlay over 3000 metres at Deauville on 21 August he started at odds of 5/1 in a thirteen-runner field which included <a href="Americain">Americain</a>, <a href="Dunaden">Dunaden</a>, <a href="Red%20Cadeaux">Red Cadeaux</a>, Kasbah Bliss, <a href="Gentoo%20%28horse%29">Gentoo</a> (<a href="Prix%20du%20Cadran">Prix du Cadran</a>, <a href="Prix%20Royal%20Oak">Prix Royal Oak</a>), Brigantin (<a href="Prix%20de%20Lutece">Prix de Lutece</a>) and <a href="Manighar">Manighar</a> (<a href="Prix%20Chaudenay">Prix Chaudenay</a>). Jukebox Jury led from the start, switched left in the straight and drew away from his rivals to win by three lengths from Kasbah Bliss. Johnston commented "The plan was to make the pace, he set a strong one and kicked off the bend. He loves it here" while Callan added "The horse is very adaptable and I just let him bowl along in front, he enjoyed it when I let him do it when he won first-time-out this season."

The Irish St Leger at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh</a> on 10 September attracted a field of six runners and Jukebox Jury, ridden by <a href="Johnny%20Murtagh">Johnny Murtagh</a> started 4/1 second choice in the betting behind the odds-on favourite <a href="Fame%20and%20Glory">Fame and Glory</a>. The other four runners were Duncan, Red Cadeaux, Fictional Account (<a href="Irish%20St%20Leger%20Trial%20Stakes">Irish St Leger Trial Stakes</a>) and the 100/1 outsider Waydownsouth. Jukebox Jury led from the start and appeared to be dominating the race before Duncan (ridden by <a href="Eddie%20Ahern">Eddie Ahern</a>) moved up alongside him in the straight. The two horses raced head to head in the last quarter mile and crossed the line together. After examining the photo finish the racecourse judges declared a <a href="Tie%20%28draw%29">dead heat</a>. Murtagh commented "I thought he was beaten in the last 100 yards as Eddie was coming there strongly, but in all fairness to my lad, typical Mark Johnston, he fought back. It was right on the line and just on the line I felt I had my head down. Eddie asked what I thought and I told him I thought he'd got there, but my head was down so I wasn't sure. I was glad when I heard the dead-heat. He was very brave because it was into a strong headwind and Eddie came to me earlier than I would have liked so I was racing from a long way out.It was a fair result for everybody. It's my first Irish Leger winner so I'm absolutely over the moon."

On his final appearance of the season the horse was sent to Australia to contest the <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a> over 3200 metres at <a href="Flemington%20Racecourse">Flemington Racecourse</a> on 1 November. Before the race a share in the horse was acquired by the Australian owners Kevin Bamford, Colleen Bamford and Gerry Ryan. Carrying a weight of 126 pounds (the second highest in the race) he finished in 20th place in the 23 runner field having sustained a <a href="hairline%20fracture">hairline fracture</a> to the <a href="cannon%20bone">cannon bone</a> of his left foreleg.

Jukebox Jury remained in training in 2012 but suffered another setback and was retired from racing in September.

Stud career.
At the end of his racing career, Jukebox Jury became a breeding stallion at the Gestut Etzean near <a href="Beerfelden">Beerfelden</a> in Germany.

Zara A. Wilson

Zara A. Wilson (born October 8, 1840) was a reformer and lawyer

Early life and family.
Zara Mahurin was born in <a href="Burnettsville%2C%20Indiana">Burnettsville, Indiana</a>, on October 8, 1840. She was the fourth in a family of eight children. Her maiden name was Mahurin, to which form it had been Americanized from the Scotch Mac Huron. Her father, Caleb Mahurin (1786-1859), was of southern birth and education, a native of <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. He was twice married, his second wife being Matilda C. Freeman (1809-1882), the mother of Wilson, to whom he was married near <a href="Troy%2C%20Ohio">Troy, Ohio</a>, in 1832.

Wilson's early life was spent on a farm, but she had the advantages of a seminary education in an institution founded and presided over by a half-brother, Isaac Mahurin (August 16, 1814 - August 23, 1870), in <a href="Fort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana">Fort Wayne, Indiana</a>. Her sister, Mathilda L. Mahurin, was assistant principal. The Methodist College opened in 1852 and closed in 1863 when the Union Army claimed most of its students. The old brick building was on West Street and US 24. 

Mathilda L. Mahurin (November 11, 1827 - April 16, 1916) was for many years a resident of <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, and taught in the public school there for many years. She was born in <a href="Miami%20County%2C%20Ohio">Miami County, Ohio</a>, on November 11, 1827, and moved to Indiana with her parents when she was a girl. She began teaching when a young woman, being for a time connected with the Methodist College at Fort Wayne. She moved to Indianapolis in 1867 and lived with her sister, Mary Kilbun Robinson (1821-1909), whose home was at 603 North New Jersey Street. Mathilda Mahurin was an active member of Meridian Street M.E. Church and died at <a href="Elkhart%2C%20Indiana">Elkhart, Indiana</a>.

Zara Mahurin had always shown a fondness for books, and during her student days mathematics was to her a fascinating study.

Career.
At the age of seventeen Zara Mahurin began to teach. After one year in Fort Wayne College, then in thriving condition, she became assistant in that school. The sudden death of her father called her home to the support of a sorrowing mother, whom she assisted, during the next year, in the settlement of a large estate. Then she resumed teaching and served with success in Lafayette and other towns of Indiana.

In <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">Lafayette, Indiana</a>, Wilson took her first public stand in favor of the equality of sex, refusing to accept a position as principal because the salary offered was ten dollars per month less than was paid to a man for the same work. She had already suffered from the disability custom had laid upon her sex. She had, in her earnest longing to do good, a strong desire to enter the ministry, but found that, because of sex, she would not be admitted to the Biblical Institute in <a href="Evansville%2C%20Indiana">Evansville, Indiana</a>.

Wilson organized the <a href="Woman%27s%20Foreign%20Missionary%20Society">Woman's Foreign Missionary Society</a> of the Methodist Episcopal Church in <a href="Goodland%2C%20Indiana">Goodland, Indiana</a>, and was corresponding secretary of that district until, her health demanding change of climate, the family home was removed to <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Nebraska">Lincoln, Nebraska</a>, in 1870. She gradually improved in the climate of Nebraska. She was district corresponding secretary of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Nebraska. 

Wilson was an efficient member of the Nebraska <a href="Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union">Woman's Christian Temperance Union</a>, delivering addresses and publishing state reports. She was three times elected corresponding secretary of the Nebraska body, resigning because of overwork. For four years she was a member of the national convention. She was State superintendent or franchise for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. In the fall of 1892 she was a candidate on the prohibition ticket for county attorney.

Wilson was always active in the cause of woman's advancement and was a warm advocate of woman's political enfranchisement, wielding a ready pen in its favor. Since her admission to the bar, in 1891, she made the legal status of women a specialty, and she wrote in that line for the press. She is the author of "A Concise Compilation of Nebraska Laws, Of Special Interest to Women" (1891).

In 1897 Wilson was nominated for Supreme Court justice by the Liberty Party, a Nebraska third-party organization.

Personal life.
In 1867 Zara Mahurin married Port Wilson, a merchant of Goodland, Indiana. Owing to broken health, her energies were for ten years confined mostly to home duties and the care of her only child, a son.

<doc id="54878375" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54878375" title="Danzig Street shooting">
Danzig Street shooting

The Danzig Street shooting or Danzig shooting was a <a href="Canadian">Canadian</a> gang-related shooting which occurred on the evening of 16 July 2012 at a <a href="block%20party">block party</a> on Danzig Street in the <a href="West%20Hill%2C%20Toronto">West Hill</a> neighbourhood of <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. Three gunmen from rival gangs opened fire in a crowd of 200 people, resulting in the deaths of 23-year-old Joshua Yasay and 14-year-old Shyanne Charles, and the shooting injury of 24 others, making it the worst <a href="mass%20shooting">mass shooting</a> in Toronto.

The incident came just six weeks after the <a href="Toronto%20Eaton%20Centre%232012%20shooting">Eaton Centre shooting</a> and made headlines around the world, renewing debate on gun crime in urban areas. There were two other deadly shooting incidents in the city within three days, and the debate reached a new level by the end of the week when a lone gunman <a href="2012%20Aurora%20shooting">opened fire in a Colorado movie theatre</a>, killing 12. There were two retaliatory shootings: the first just hours afterwards and another on 2 September.

Although initially believed to be the resumption of a 2003 gang war between the Galloway Boys and the Malvern Crew, the shooting was not part of a territorial dispute or retaliation from another incident, but a disagreement between teenagers who decided to have a gunfight in the middle of a party. Justice Ian Nordheimer said of the incident, "Ordinary persons do not understand how anyone, much less teenagers, can come not only to possess such weapons, but to use them in such a brutal and indifferent way." The four young men convicted were aged 15 to 19 at the time of the shooting; the names of Folorunso Owusu and Naod Tsegazab were withheld under the <a href="Youth%20Criminal%20Justice%20Act">Youth Criminal Justice Act</a> until they were sentenced as adults.

The shooting led the <a href="Toronto%20Police%20Service">Toronto Police Service</a> to develop new crime-prevention strategies in the Neighbourhood Officers program which builds community relationships in at-risk areas to gain information on local crime. This has allowed targeted crackdowns on gang activity and dramatic reductions in shootings and other crimes. Police 43 Division (southeast <a href="Scarborough%2C%20Toronto">Scarborough</a>, including Danzig Street) reported no homicides in 2013.

Background.
The Galloway Boys ( G-Way) are one of the most notoriously violent criminal gangs in Toronto, their turf centered on the intersection of Galloway and <a href="Kingston%20Road%20%28Toronto%29">Kingston Road</a>s in the neighbourhood of <a href="West%20Hill%2C%20Toronto">West Hill</a>. They terrorized <a href="Scarborough%2C%20Toronto">Scarborough</a> in 2003 and 2004 while battling with rival gang the Malvern Crew over territory for street drugs and prostitution. The deadly turf war resulted in Ontario's largest street-gang crackdown and prosecutions, with 75 arrests of alleged gang members on more than 600 criminal charges.

With the gang's leadership locked away, there was a dramatic decrease in violent crime. However, many were sentenced to five- or seven-year jail terms and were released back into the community around 2010 and began mentoring youths recruited into the gang. The younger members obtained guns and were not afraid to use them in a series of conflicts for control of the gang and territory, resulting in a string of shootings and killings in 2011 and 2012. By September 2012 there was a 22% increase in shooting incidents and a 41% increase in shooting victims in the city.

Blockos are a form of <a href="block%20party">block party</a> based on a tradition of outdoor gatherings in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. They are held by neighbours and outreach workers, particularly during the Toronto's warm, humid summers. Daytime activities are focused on children and the evenings provide an alternative for residents who can't afford to go out. Since the 1970s, many are held each year at <a href="Toronto%20Community%20Housing">Toronto Community Housing Corporation</a> (TCHC) developments without problems.

The 101-unit townhouse <a href="public%20housing">social housing</a> complex at Danzig Street and <a href="Morningside%20Avenue%20%28Toronto%29">Morningside Avenue</a> is called Morningside Coronation by TCHC and D-Block by residents. Toys and bicycles fill the tiny yards of the young families packed into the complex. Alcohol is prohibited in common areas without a special-occassion permit. There is a strict no-gun policy: anyone caught with a gun is turned over to police and tenants caught housing someone with a gun are evicted.

Event.
Block party.
The 16 July 2012 blocko was organized by resident Shannon Longshaw, a 28-year-old mother of two, as an afternoon children's barbecue. However, from 7 July the Twitter account @2ToneShorty, linked to 19-year-old Nahom Tsegazab, a Galloway Boys member known as "Gifted", had been promoting the gathering as a "HennessyBlock Party". The messages promised a live DJ and 30 bottles of <a href="Hennessy">Hennessy</a> cognac on ice, free for all. Over the course of a week, more than two dozen open invitations were sent from the account and spread across social media as #hennessyblockparty. Some residents made Twitter posts expressing concerns over the potential for violence.

The party, which was delayed from Sunday 15 July due to a rainstorm, began in Longshaw's backyard at 2 pm. Tenants chipped in, provided food and ran activities for area children such as face painting and putting a water sprinkler on playground equipment for a makeshift water slide. Tsegazab handed out school supplies and basketballs. The children's party was to end at 5 pm, but by then adults were already gathering in the parking lot and the Galloway Boys "took ownership" of the blocko. By 7 pm the crowd had grown thicker, with hip hop music blaring and alcohol flowing. An hour later there were Jaguars and Hummers parked around the block, marijuana smoke in the air, and more than 200 people packed the complex's internal laneway. Worried about people they didn't know, some residents took their children inside their homes. One resident couldn't use the walkway without bumping into people, describing it as being like a jammed nightclub.

Several noise complaints were made to police and bicycle patrols were dispatched, but the party was allowed to continue. According to Gene Jones, then-CEO of TCHC, the event had not been sanctioned by TCHC and should have ended before 9 pm.

Provocations.
The party was filling-in when the Galloway Boys began "G-checking", confronting people they didn't recognize and telling those from rival gang territories to leave. 18-year-old Shaquan Mesquito of Malvern, an alleged Malvern Crew member known as "Bam Bam", had come to the party unarmed and was ordered to leave by Tsegazab's 15-year-old brother Naod. Naod threatened to shoot Mesquito if he did not leave immediately.

Angry at being forced to leave, Mesquito sent out a number of Twitter posts urging others to go on a killing spree and shoot-up the party. Shortly after 9 pm, Nahom Tsegazab was warned about these threats. Tsegazab then armed himself with a .40 calibre pistol and told others to be prepared for a possible shootout.

Shooting.
17-year-old Folorunso Owusu, a Chester "Le Side" gang member, arrived at the party and was confronted by Nahom Tsegazab, who displayed a handgun and challenged Owusu to commit to a fight if he didn't leave. At approximately 10:40 pm, less than two minutes after arriving at the party, Owusu opened fire and shot Nahom Tsegazab twice with a 9 mm handgun. One of these bullets passed through Tsegazab and injured a bystander.

Nahom Tsegazab was shot in the right biceps and abdomen. He fell to the ground in front of 207 Danzig St. and reached for his gun, recklessly firing 11 rounds at Owusu who retreated through the crowd. One of these bullets struck Owusu in the leg.

A third shooter, who remains unidentified, fired 14 rounds from an Uzi submachine-gun into the crowd.

24 bystanders were shot, including 2 fatalities, and three people were trampled by the panicked crowd. The shooting victims were aged 22 months to 33 years.

Shyanne Charles, 14, was fleeing from the initial gunfire when she ran into the spray of bullets from the third shooter. She collapsed and died on the doorstep of 203 Danzig St.

Joshua Yasay, 23, a community mentor with an honours degree in criminology who aspired to be a police officer, was shot by a bullet that pierced his heart and lungs. It has not been determined whether Tsegazab or the third shooter killed him.

The other shooting victims include:

A pregnant woman was hospitalized after being trampled during the panic that followed the shooting.

Aftermath and initial arrests.
The injured were taken to five area hospitals by 16 ambulances and an bus. In May 2015, a team of paramedics were honoured for their actions during the shooting.

Investigators found more than 25 fired shell casings at the scene and recovered five firearms. 30 alcohol bottles were picked up after the shooting.

On 19 July, while being treated at hospital, Nahom Tsegazab was charged with reckless discharge of a firearm in relation to the Danzig St. shooting.

On 27 July, Mesquito was arrested on two counts of uttering threats to cause serious bodily harm at the block party. At the time of his arrest, Mesquito was found carrying a loaded .22 calibre revolver for which he faced nine weapons-related charges. Later that summer, Mesquito's family were evicted by TCHC for a lease violation, possibly stemming from these charges.

Police, community workers and the media suspected that the shooting was between members of the Galloway Boys and the Malvern Crew, having anticipated a violent clash as some senior members of the rival gangs were being released from prison.

In the search for gunmen, police executed a series of vehicle inspections, checks on parolees, and search warrants in the week of 29 July – 4 August, in which over 20 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition were seized. There were concerns for the 4 August <a href="Caribana">Caribana</a> parade, which attracts one million people, and where there had been a fatal shooting in 2011.

Social media.
Initial reports from the shooting came via Twitter posts from witnesses and victims.

Within hours of the shooting, Twitter was flooded with posts referencing "Ledda" in connection with 14-year-old victim Shyanne Charles, warning that Ledda would seek out those responsible for the violence. "This is just the beginning. Touched the wrong people," read another message. Police also investigated whether a rap video posted 2 days before the shooting may have been related.

Police went through thousands of text messages and intercepted phone calls in the investigation, as they rebuilt the sequence of events. Among these messages were several in which Mesquito claimed responsibility for the shooting.

Crime victim advocate Kemi Omololu-Olunloyo believed the mass shooting was fuelled by social media.

Investigation and later arrests.
Police were met with silence in many areas as they asked for witnesses to come forward. There were a lack of tips despite so many people being witnesses or victims of the events. This began to change within a few weeks as the Summer Safety Initiative was launched to confront gangs and violence, putting officers on foot patrols in high-crime areas. Officers built relationships with residents of these communities, helping them overcome a historic distrust of police and fears of gang retaliation.

A related shooting occurred on 2 September at a TCHC townhouse complex on Chester Le Blvd. Naod Tsegazab had tracked-down Owusu in retaliation for trying to kill his brother, Nahom. However, Naod only shot Owusu once in the leg before his gun jammed. As a result of the shooting, a search warrant was carried out on Owusu's Chester Le Blvd. home, leading to cocaine trafficking charges. Naod was charged with the attempted murder of Owusu.

The first murder charge of the Danzig St. shooting investigation was made against Mesquito on 7 November. He was charged with the attempted murder of Nahom Tsegazab, 2 counts of first-degree murder and 23 counts of aggravated assault. Nahom Tsegazab was charged with two counts of second-degree murder and 22 counts of aggravated assault later that month. Owusu received similar charges at the end of November. On 4 December, Naod was the fourth person charged in relation to the Danzig St. shooting, charged with threatening death and weapons offenses but not murder.

On 23 January 2015, the murder and assault charges against Mesquito were dropped after police uncovered evidence that he was in an apartment building away at the time of the shooting. Mesquito had continued to claim credit for the shooting throughout the 30 months he was in custody. His lawyer suggested that since Mesquito had called for people to shoot-up the party that he thought people close to him had done it and so took responsibility. In fact, Mesquito was not connected to Owusu who had initiated the shooting. The lawyer stated that he had never before been involved in a case where police, the Crown attorney and the defence had worked together to uncover the facts.

Convictions.
Nahom Tsegazab pleaded guilty on 11 April 2014 to two counts of manslaughter and six counts of aggravated assault, and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Tsegazab admitted that in participating in the gunfight he was a party to all the deaths and injuries that ensued.

Shaquan Mesquito pleaded guilty on 23 January 2015 to counselling to commit murder, possession of a firearm, breach of a prohibition order and uttering a threat. He was sentenced to nine years in prison (less time served). Although no connection was found to link Mesquito with Owusu, his threats to revisit the block party and "shoot it up" put the Galloway Boys on a "hair trigger".

Naod Tsegazab pleaded guilty in 2016 to the attempted murder of Owusu in the 2 September Chester Le shooting, believing that Owusu had shot his brother. He was sentenced as an adult to seven years in prison.

Folorunso Owusu pleaded not guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of attempted murder against Nahom Tsezagab, two counts of aggravated assault, and one charge of reckless discharging of a firearm. (Multiple charges of criminal negligence causing bodily harm were severed in a pre-trial motion.) The defence maintained during the seven-week trial that Owusu was innocent and a victim of circumstance, shot while attending the party. The Crown provided a recording of Naod Tsegazab in the courthouse cells identifying Owusu, by nickname, as his brother's shooter. However, Naod testified that he invented the story to look tougher in jail and Nahom Tsegazab testified that Owusu did not shoot him.

Found guilty, Owusu was sentenced as an adult to life in prison on 7 December 2016. None of the bullets Owusu fired killed anyone, but his actions initiated the gunfire that killed 2 and injured 22 bystanders. In May 2017, Owusu was sentenced to four years for the criminal negligence convictions, to be served concurrently. With time served, he is eligible for parole in 2019.

Effects.
Crime and policing.
The 16 July Danzig Street shooting was the worst <a href="mass%20shooting">mass shooting</a> in Toronto, and occurred just six weeks after the <a href="Toronto%20Eaton%20Centre%232012%20shooting">Eaton Centre shooting</a>.
The event made headlines around the world and prompted renewed debate on gun crime in urban areas. There were two other deadly shooting incidents in the city within three days, and three shootings that Friday night. That same evening a lone gunman <a href="2012%20Aurora%20shooting">opened fire in a Colorado movie theatre</a>, killing 12.

Although data showed crime was decreasing nationally, a 25–26 July Forum Research poll for the "<a href="National%20Post">National Post</a>" suggested that Canadians believed otherwise. The recent mass shootings and media coverage had a majority fearing "a violent crime wave". Pamela Rutledge, a media researcher studying the psychological impact of news coverage, stated that the apparent randomness of the crimes could lead to this perception. "They really trigger a sense of fear in us because they aren't explainable [...] There's no way of making sense of it or figuring out why it didn't happen to me. So that anxiety accelerates your sense of danger."

The <a href="Toronto%20Police%20Service">Toronto Police Service</a> established a strong uniform presence at Danzig St., Kingston-Galloway, and other areas that struggle with gang violence in an attempt to stop acts of revenge. This was extended with the Summer Safety Initiative, a seven-week program of mandatory overtime which effectively added more than 300 officers to patrols. The program emphasized "old-school policing" with officers walking street patrols in high-crime areas, building relationships with residents and the community. During these summer weeks, which typically see a spike in shootings and other crime, shooting deaths declined from a seven-year average of 6.4 to 2 with dramatic drops in other violent crime. The initiative cost $2 million, though Police Chief Bill Blair said it saved money by preventing crimes that are expensive to investigate.

The 2012 Summer Safety Initiative led to crime-prevention strategies and the development of the Neighbourhood Officers program in 2013, which focuses on high-crime areas in each of Toronto's 17 police divisions. In the program, officers are dedicated to a specific area for a period of at least two years, shifting away from enforcement-based policing to building relationships with residents, learning of specific issues affecting the communities and improving intelligence about local crime. The provincially-funded TAVIS (Toronto Anti-violence Intervention Strategy) program had a similar shift in focus, having faced controversy for a practice of stopping, questioning and documenting people – a procedure known as "carding" – which resulted in community distrust.

The shooting brought an offer from Customs and Immigration officers to patrol with Toronto Police in hunts for gunmen. A liaison officer was established so police can quickly obtain immigration information on suspects. Nahom Tsegazab had arrived in Canada as a refugee from Somalia.

Violent crime rates dropped in the year following the shooting, and in 2013 there were no homicides in 43 Division (southeast Scarborough, including Danzig St.) which recorded falling crime rates in every category. Deputy Chief of Police Peter Sloly credited the declining crime rates to multiple actors: the city, non-profits, volunteers, youth outreach workers, community organizations, and a new victim and witness support program. In 2015, community policing officers reported feeling more welcome and receiving more information from residents, intelligence which allowed police to move to a more "surgical policing model" that was less invasive on the community.

<a href="Toronto%20Police%20Association">Toronto Police Association</a> President Mike McCormack said of the Danzig Street shooting: "It changed the way we gather intelligence, do investigations and it really brought the whole issue of gang culture and some of the challenges that we have in policing to the forefront."

Gang crackdown.
The Danzig Street shooting generated new intelligence for police of an internal leadership struggle for control of the Galloway Boys and a territorial dispute with the neighbouring Orton Park Boys. Police linked the Galloway Boys to eight other shooting incidents between 4 September 2011 and 10 August 2012, including:

Barnaby's murder sparked a police crackdown on the Scarborough gangs. Project Brazen was carried out from April to September 2012, resulting in nine arrests, the seizure of five firearms, and attempted murder charges for four shootings. Homicide detectives and officers from Scarborough divisions reviewed the evidence and launched Project Quell in June 2013, identifying 7 members of the Orton Park Boys and 25 members of the Galloway Boys, charging them with a total of 363 offenses. Search warrants were executed on 3 October in Toronto, London and Waterloo, seizing more than 1 kg of cocaine and $10,000 in drug proceeds.

Project Quell officers confirmed that the Danzig Street investigation triggered investigations into the Galloway Boys and Orton Park.

Social programs.
The Danzig Street shooting brought renewed attention to the report "Roots of Youth Violence" commissioned by the Ontario Liberal government following a fatal Toronto high school shooting in 2007. The report warned of "deeply troubling" increases in the frequency and severity of youth violence, and addressed children's mental health issues, poverty, racism, education, family issues, the justice system, and a lack of voice for youth. In August 2012, the Liberal government incorporated some of the recommendations in a $20 million action plan to curb youth violence.

Nigerian-born businessman Akanimo Udofiya donated $150,000 over three years to help fund Our Space, a community drop-in centre established in a formerly vacant townhouse at 230 Danzig Street. The centre provided after-school programs, a homework club, hot meals for area youth, employment resources, and a base for the Danzig Residents Committee and community outreach programs. Toronto Community Housing donated space for the community hub, evicted one resident in connection with the shooting, and installed new lighting and 20 security cameras in May 2013.

A number of memorial scholarships were created. <a href="York%20University">York University</a> set up the Joshua Yasay Award for excellence in criminology and community service. Two trusts were set up in Shyanne Charles' name, for scholarships starting at the elementary school level.

Rob Ford.
Mayor <a href="Rob%20Ford">Rob Ford</a> called for the Danzig Street shooters to be expelled from the city: "I want these people out of the city. And I'm not going to stop. Not put 'em in jail, then come back and you can live in the city. No. I want 'em out of the city. Go somewhere else. I don't want 'em living in the city anymore." The day after the shooting, he added, "We must use every legal means to make life for these thugs miserable, to put them behind bars, or to run them out of town. We will not rest until being a gang member is a miserable, undesirable life." Ford called for longer prison sentences and decried "hug a thug" social programs, voting against accepting federal grants worth more than $16 million.

On 31 October 2013, Toronto Police recovered a video which appeared to show Ford smoking crack cocaine, a video first reported by American gossip website <a href="Gawker">Gawker</a>. On 11 June 2013, Gawker and the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" identified the house where the video was shot, the family home of a high school friend of Ford's known in the neighbourhood as a drug den. On 6 November 2013, Ford admitted that he had smoked crack cocaine and associated with drug dealers. The scandal was reported internationally and compromised Ford's position of leadership and his role as the youth mentor he had often claimed to be.

While <a href="Toronto%20mayoral%20election%2C%202014">campaigning for re-election</a> in 2014, Ford visited Danzig Street on the second anniversary of the mass shooting, dodging questions about his own connection to drug dealers. Councillor Paula Fletcher criticized his attending the event. "You can't have it both ways – you can't be part of it and then crusading to stop it ... You can't technically be condoning guns and gangs and then going out saying how terrible it is that people have been shot and killed."

In media.
Toronto Police Sergeant Rod Chung collaborated with local hip-hop artist <a href="Promise%20%28rapper%29">Promise</a> to reach out to urban youth. With help from artists Kaid and Liya, they released the track "Make a Change", inspired by the Danzig Street shooting. Promise wrote the lyrics which call for taking ownership of the city and an end to violence. The track premiered 30 September 2012 on <a href="CKFG-FM">CKFG-FM</a>, a black-owned-and-operated commercial radio station, which hosted an on-air town hall meeting to continue discussions between the community, artists, and the police.

The day after the Danzig Street shooting, Toronto-born rapper <a href="Drake%20%28musician%29">Drake</a> tweeted his condolences to the families of Yasay and Charles. He rapped about this "one summer day that went horribly wrong" as a featured artist on Snoop Dogg's reggae track "<a href="No%20Guns%20Allowed">No Guns Allowed</a>":

The track premiered live on "<a href="Conan%20%28talk%20show%29">Conan</a>" on 11 March 2013 and was released on 2 April 2013 as the third single from Snoop's album "<a href="Reincarnated%20%28album%29">Reincarnated</a>".

Biler Diary

Biler Diary is a 2017 <a href="India">India</a>n <a href="Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">Bengali</a> film written and directed by Biswaroop Biswas. Starring <a href="Biswanath%20Basu">Biswanath Basu</a> and <a href="Samadarshi%20Dutta">Samadarshi Dutta</a> in main roles, the film provides a peek into the lives of students of residential school <a href="Ramakrishna%20Mission%20Vidyalaya%2C%20Narendrapur">Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Narendrapur</a> through the eyes of a alumni, who reminisces his time in the same. Samadarshi, who plays the role of the alumni, is an alumni of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Narendrapur in real life too.

Plot.
The film begins with a 'retreat', in which alumni from different batches of a residential school have travelled to their alma mater for a reunion. Anabil, one of the alumnus, presently working with UNICEF India as a "child protection specialist", narrates the story of his childhood days spent in the residential school.
In his childhood, when he was admitted to the residential school by his parents, Anabil happened to be a very shy student possessing below average abilities. For such a child, time table specific, demanding hostel life was not easy. A mischievous senior student Bishey and his gang added to Anabil’s woes.
Due to similarity in names, Anabil was nicknamed 'Beelay' (the pet name of Swami Vivekananda)by his seniors. With the passage of time when it was almost certain that Anabil would fail to adapt the hostel life, a new monk arrives as the hostel-warden. The new monk 'Kanu da', by virtue of his gentle qualities becomes Anabil's inspiration. The little boy seems to have been enlightened and starts showing signs of development. At about this time, Anabil finds a magical diary that completely changes his life. As the film progresses, the secret of this mysterious diary slowly unfolds.

The band's repertoire was inspired by Cuban and Puerto Rican dance-oriented styles such as <a href="guaracha">guaracha</a>, <a href="son%20cubano">son</a>, <a href="pachanga">pachanga</a> and <a href="Bomba%20%28Puerto%20Rico%29">bomba</a>. In 1968, Palmieri disbanded La Perfecta in order to seek a more experimental approach incorporating <a href="funk">funk</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul</a> elements into his music. Palmieri and his new ensemble (still similar to La Perfecta, with <a href="Barry%20Rogers">Barry Rogers</a> being replaced by Lewis Kahn) recorded a series of four albums for Tico that have been said to contain his "best sounding" work. These four albums were "Champagne" (1968), "Justicia" (1969), "<a href="Superimposition%20%28album%29">Superimposition</a>" (1970) and "Vámonos Pa'l Monte" (1971).

The album was recorded at Incredible Sounds studio in New York during the winter season. According to Palmieri, it was so cold he had to wear gloves during the recording sessions.

Lyrics and composition.
In "Justicia", Palmieri demonstrates the the two main traits of his music during the era, namely "a grounding in social issues" at the lyrical level, and "a continuous, insistent experimentation" at the musical level. The social aspect of the album is patent on the title track, which opens the album and has been said to "epitomize the "salsa" style". Although uncredited, its lyrics where written by lead singer <a href="Ismael%20Quintana">Ismael Quintana</a>. Musically, it has been described as "a composition in which the guaracha predominates within a multiform and polyrhythmic salsa", and its lyrics call for justice for "boricuas" (Puerto Ricans) and "niggers" (African-Americans). This social theme would be continued in Palmieri's performance at <a href="Sing%20Sing">Sing Sing</a> Prison (particularly the recitations), as well as the opener of "Vámonos pa'l monte", titled "Revolt / La libertad, lógico". Together with the title track, side A contains the more Latin-based pieces of the album, such as <a href="Rafael%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20Mar%C3%ADn">Rafael Hernández</a>'s bolero "Amor ciego" and <a href="Ignacio%20Pi%C3%B1eiro">Ignacio Piñeiro</a>'s son-rumba "Lindo yambú". The folkloric-sounding "My Spiritual Indian" contains a trumpet solo by <a href="Alfredo%20%26quot%3BChocolate%26quot%3B%20Armenteros">Alfredo "Chocolate" Armenteros</a>.

Palmieri's experimental approach to Latin jazz is mostly contained on side B of the album. "Everything Is Everything" is based on a standard blues form, with strong North American influences and a rhythm section similar to that of the <a href="soul%20jazz">soul jazz</a> groups of the 1960s. "Verdict on Judge Street" is an extended jazz waltz, with long instrumental solos and few Latin elements. Nonetheless, on piano, Palmieri reserved his left hand for "<a href="guajeo">guajeo</a>s" (vamping) throughout the track, while his right hand played jazz chords, creating an ambiguous contrast. The practice of including Cuban music on side A and experimental/jazz music on side B would be continued on "Superimposition".

Release.
The album was released by <a href="Tico%20Records">Tico Records</a> in 1969. During the recording sessions, ownership of Tico Records passed from <a href="Morris%20Levy">Morris Levy</a> to <a href="George%20Goldner">George Goldner</a>; only the latter was credited as producer. <a href="Fania%20Records">Fania Records</a>, which later acquired the Tico Records catalogue, re-issued the album on CD in 2006.

Artwork.
The album cover was designed by visual artist Ely Besalel, who had worked on many previous Latin and jazz albums for <a href="Roulette">Roulette Records</a> and Tico Records. The cover displays the album title in a "stark, bold typography" that has been said to represent "a timeless cry for justice". In the top left corner, a small picture of Palmieri sitting on the floor, "thinking, worrying", further reinforces the message of the album. The photograph was taken by Warren Flagler. Besalel, who had already worked with Palmieri, would go on to develop a longer lasting relationship with him, working on "Superimposition", "Vámonos pa'l monte" and "Unifinished Masterpiece".

Reception and legacy.
On his book "Latin Jazz", <a href="John%20Storm%20Roberts">John Storm Roberts</a> wrote a favourable review of "Justicia", calling it "the beginning of a number of extraordinarily important Palmieri releases". Tony Wilds wrote a mixed review for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, describing the album as "interesting" but "only average for an Eddie Palmieri record, which is still heads above most, and probably essential listening".

After its release, "Justicia" has a long-lasting impact on the thriving New York salsa scene, with numerous socially-conscious bands arising shortly after its release. Notable examples include <a href="Tony%20Pab%C3%B3n">Tony Pabón</a>'s La Protesta and <a href="Manny%20Oquendo">Manny Oquendo</a>'s Conjunto Libre. Oquendo had been a long-time member of Palmieri's band, playing in most of his albums, including "Justicia".

Barão de Itararé

Apparício Fernando de Brinkerhoff Torelly, (January 29, 1895 — November 27, 1971) also known as Apporelly and as the <a href="Fake%20titles%20of%20nobility">fake title of nobility</a> of Barão de Itararé ("Baron of <a href="Itarar%C3%A9">Itararé</a>)", was a Brazilian journalist and writer. He was a pioneer of political humor in the country. 

Torelly was born in Rio Grande, in 1895. He studied in a jesuit boarding school in São Leopoldo and attended medical school, before dropping out. In 1925, Torelly moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he wrote for several newspapers, such as "<a href="O%20Globo">O Globo</a>" and "<a href="A%20Manh%C3%A3">A Manhã</a>"; there, he published humorous pieces, poking fun at politicians of the time. Torelly would leave A Manhã ("The Morning") in 1926, founding his own humor newspaper, "A Manha" ( a pun with the former, meaning "The Whining)." 

Torelly was a member of the <a href="Brazilian%20Communist%20Party">Brazilian Communist Party</a>. He was arrested in 1935 because of his ties with the party, then illegal. He was released one year later. When the party recovered its legal status, in 1947, Torelly ran for councilman in the Rio de Janeiro city elections.

Origin of the title.
During the <a href="Brazilian%20Revolution%20of%201930">Revolution of 1930</a>, a rumor was spread that a battle would be fought in the city of Itararé between the federal troops loyal to president <a href="Washington%20Lu%C3%ADs">Washington Luís</a> and the <a href="Get%C3%BAlio%20Vargas">Getúlio Vargas</a>' troops. The battle did not happen, and a compromise was reached between the two groups. Then Torelly adopted his self-styled nobilty title, in honor of a battle that never happened.

H! Vltg3 (song)

The remix was created by Evidence and cut by DJ Babu, both from the hip hop group Dilated Peoples, with additional production by Porse 1.
The track was edited by DJ Revolution and mixed by Troy Staton. Pharoahe Monch guests with a rap verse on the track.

By working with Pharaohe Monch, the band was hoping to get the fans interested in his work. Mike Shinoda told MTV:
""He’s just a real mellow [guy], soft-spoken, [but] there’s a lot of hunger there. There’s a lot of intensity even though he’s been doing it for a really long time and he’s really successful in those genres of music [underground hip-hop]. But with a larger, mainstream audience, they don’t know him and that’s where we wanted to make that little connection — just bridge that gap. Hopefully, we could say to [our fans], ‘Well, we like this guy. We’ve been listening for a long time. Hopefully you’ll dig it, too.’""

About Dilated Peoples' presence on the track, Brad Delson said during a linkinpark.com chat on July 3, 2002: ""we are big fans of evidence and dialated so we were very honored for him to lace that track so to speak""

The remix contains a vocal sample of the song "All For One" by hip hop group Brand Nubian. Because of this, members of the group, Derek Murphy (Sadat X), Lorenzo Dechalus (Lord Jamar), and Maxwell Dixon (Grand Puba), were also credited for the track.

The instrumental samples the song "Family" by Lamont Dozier.

The remix can be heard during the "<a href="Frat%20Party%20At%20The%20Pankake%20Festival">Frat Party At The Pankake Festival</a>" documentary.

Music Video.
The music video for "H! Vltg3" was directed by Estevan Oriol for MTV2's "MTV:Playback".

Abrar Hussain is a <a href="British%20Muslim">British-Muslim</a> <a href="Filmmaking">filmmaker</a>, writer, producer and director. He was raised in London, UK and studied at <a href="Kingston%20University">Kingston University</a>.

Career.
Model Mosque: (2007-2008).
Hussain began his production career in 2007 by writing, producing, directing and presenting the Model Mosque show on the <a href="Islam%20Channel">Islam Channel</a>.

The research for the show consisted of dispatching questionnaires to over 1,000 mosques, followed by telephone interviews, and site visits. In an interview with <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> newspaper Hussain said “There is so much disparity between mosque standards, and the show is a way for mosques to see the positive work that is already being done.”

The show attracted some criticism from conservative <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s because of its <a href="Reality%20television">reality TV format</a>, with some critics comparing it to <a href="The%20X%20Factor">The X-Factor</a>. Hussain stated that the aim of the show was to show the positive side of mosques, not to criticise them. In an interview with the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, <a href="Islam%20Channel">Islam Channel</a> CEO <a href="Mohamed%20Ali%20Harrath">Mohammed Ali Harrath</a> said, "We believe in name-and-fame, not name-and-shame.

Participating mosques were located geographically all over the country, and the competition was won by <a href="East%20London%20Mosque">East London Mosque</a>.

Hussain presented the final of Model Mosque at the <a href="Global%20Peace%20and%20Unity">Global Peace and Unity</a> (GPU) event in 2007, in-front of a live audience of 30,000 people. Judges on the Model Mosque show included <a href="Salma%20Yaqoob">Salma Yaqoob</a> and <a href="Iqbal%20Sacranie">Iqbal Saccranie</a>. Model Mosque was positively received by the mainstream media, with <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>, <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> and <a href="ABC%20News%20%28Australia%29">ABC News Australia</a>, reporting positively on the show.

Faith Off (2008).
Hussain produced and directed a 2nd show for the <a href="Islam%20Channel">Islam Channel</a> titled “Faith Off”. This was a game show format where contestants from different religious backgrounds would compete for prizes. <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> newspaper called it “Britain's first interfaith <a href="game%20show">game show</a>”. The show was hosted by Muslim comedian and actor <a href="Jeff%20Mirza">Jeff Mirza</a>.

Hussain stated on the <a href="Reuters">Reuters news channel</a> that he was trying to show that there was “harmony amongst the different faith groups”.

The format of the show included a multiple choice current affairs segment, in addition to a home or away round, when contestants could answer questions on their own faith, or the opposing team's for further points.

One of the Jewish contestants on the show, 42-year-old Danny Judelson, said: "A <a href="game%20show">game show</a> is an original idea, to say the least ... I thought it was interesting that the channel were taking seriously the opportunity to educate their audience. There's a very serious purpose behind it."

The show was well received by interfaith groups, Ethan Cole of the <a href="The%20Christian%20Post">Christian Post</a> wrote, "Faith Off draws contestants with religious backgrounds from <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, and has them compete for cash prizes by answering questions on both general and religious knowledge.”

Hussain said of the show in an interview with <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> "We’re living in a multi-faith, multi-cultural society, so it's about transferring the basic blocks of knowledge. It’s also about learning the similarities between religions, instead of focusing on the differences."

The Pakistan Floods.
In 2011 Hussain wrote, produced and directed “The Pakistan Floods”, a TV documentary made in response to the lack of support from western governments to the humanitarian crisis in Pakistan.

The film was commissioned by <a href="Press%20TV">Press TV</a> and broadcast in the UK in 2011.

Liverpool’s "transformational plan" for the 2022 games is predicted to accelerate £1 billion ($1.3 billion/€1.1 billion) of investment up to 10 years ahead of schedule and create more than 12,000 jobs.

The new <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> <a href="Bramley-Moore%20Dock%20Stadium">football stadium</a> will accommodate a temporary athletics track for the Games. It is claimed this will be "without any disruption to those features" with the track due to be installed after the final home game of the 2021-2022 season and removed before the first scheduled match of the 2022-2023 campaign. 

The city is also proposing to host swimming at a new 50 metres pool within the city centre <a href="Liverpool%20docks">dock</a> system that would remain in place after the Games and provide both a swimming and visitor attraction legacy. Among the other proposals is triple jump, long jump and pole vault on the dockside by neighbouring <a href="Mann%20Island">Mann Island</a> in the city.

<a href="Twenty20%20Cricket">Twenty20 cricket</a> and track cycling, as Liverpool 2022’s "optional sports", would take place in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford Cricket Ground</a> and the <a href="Manchester%20Velodrome">Manchester Velodrome</a>.

Other key highlights of Liverpool’s hosting plan include five existing venues. The <a href="Arena%20and%20Convention%20Centre%20Liverpool">Arena and Convention Centre Liverpool</a>, home to the 11,000-seat <a href="Echo%20Arena%20Liverpool">Echo Arena</a>, BT Convention Centre and Exhibition Centre Liverpool, would stage badminton, artistic gymnastics, judo, netball and wrestling. Liverpool FC's <a href="Anfield">Anfield stadium</a> has been cited as the venue for the Opening Ceremony and rugby sevens, while <a href="St%20George%27s%20Hall%2C%20Liverpool">St George’s Hall</a> and <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a> would host the squash and boxing finals respectively and <a href="Stanley%20Park%2C%20Liverpool">Stanley Park</a> would stage the lawn bowls. 

A further notable element of Liverpool’s plan is to have the Athletes’ Village beside Everton FC’s new stadium in <a href="Nelson%20Dock%2C%20Liverpool">Nelson Dock</a>, within Peel Land and Property’s £5.5 billion ($7 billion/€6.3 billion) Liverpool Waters scheme - residential developments that already have outlined planning permission meaning construction could start in the first half of 2018.

Janet Clarke

Janet Marion Clarke (née Snodgrass; 4 June 1851 – 28 April 1909) was an Australian socialite and philanthropist. She was known to the general public as Lady Clarke, a title which she assumed after <a href="Sir%20William%20Clarke%2C%201st%20Baronet">her husband</a>'s elevation to the <a href="baronet">baronet</a>age in 1882.

Early life and marriage.
Clarke was born at "Doogalloook", a station on the <a href="Goulburn%20River">Goulburn River</a> near <a href="Yea%2C%20Victoria">Yea, Victoria</a>. She was the daughter of Charlotte Agnes (née Cotton) and <a href="Peter%20Snodgrass">Peter Snodgrass</a>. Her father, who died when she was 16, was an affluent landowner and a member of parliament. Her paternal grandfather was <a href="Kenneth%20Snodgrass">Kenneth Snodgrass</a>, a <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> officer originally from Scotland, while her maternal grandfather – the owner of "Doogallook" – was the naturalist <a href="John%20Cotton%20%28ornithologist%29">John Cotton</a>. In 1873, aged 21, Janet married <a href="Sir%20William%20Clarke%2C%201st%20Baronet">William Clarke</a>, 41-year-old widower for whom she had previously worked as a governess. She was stepmother to the four children from his first marriage, and bore an additional eight children herself (two of which died young). In 1874, her husband inherited a substantial fortune from his father, <a href="William%20John%20Turner%20Clarke">W. J. T. Clarke</a>. He became the largest landowner in the country, and an exceedingly generous philanthropist, for which in 1882 he was raised to the <a href="baronet">baronet</a>age (the first Australian to be so honoured).

Socialite.
In 1876, the Clarkes moved into "<a href="Rupertswood">Rupertswood</a>", a large country mansion they had built near <a href="Sunbury%2C%20Victoria">Sunbury</a>. Their city residence was "Cliveden", an equally massive mansion in <a href="East%20Melbourne%2C%20Victoria">East Melbourne</a> that was completed in 1888. The couple were known for their lavish hospitality, hosting frequent balls, luncheons, dinners, and garden parties. Many singers and musicians got their starts by being asked to perform at these events. During the depression of the early 1890s, Clarke also ran a soup kitchen out of "Cliveden".

In 1882, Clarke was involved in the creation of <a href="the%20Ashes%20urn">the Ashes urn</a>, the trophy awarded to the winner of the <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a> series between <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> and <a href="England%20national%20cricket%20team">England</a>. During their <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201882%E2%80%9383">1882–83 tour of Australia</a>, <a href="Ivo%20Bligh">Ivo Bligh</a> were invited to spend Christmas at "Rupertswood" – Sir William being the president of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>. As a joke, Clarke presented Bligh with a small urn, in which the ashes of a burnt <a href="bail%20%28cricket%29">bail</a> had been placed. This was a reference to <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201882">Australia's defeat of England</a> earlier in the year, after which which a mock obituary had appeared in "<a href="The%20Sporting%20Times">The Sporting Times</a>" proclaiming that English cricket had died and "the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia".

Community work and philanthropy.
Clarke was the president of the Melbourne District Nursing Society (later renamed the Royal District Nursing Service) for all but one year between 1889 and 1909. In 2017, the organisation renamed itself <a href="Bolton%20Clarke">Bolton Clarke</a>, in honour of her and <a href="William%20Kinsey%20Bolton">William Kinsey Bolton</a>. Clarke also served on the boards of the <a href="Royal%20Women%27s%20Hospital">Women's Hospital</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Hospital for Sick Children</a>, and <a href="Melbourne%20Girls%20Grammar">Melbourne Girls' Grammar School</a>. In 1889, she donated £6,000 towards the establishment of the Hostel for Women University Students at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Trinity College, Melbourne</a>. This provided the first separate residential accommodation for women students, and was later renamed <a href="Janet%20Clarke%20Hall">Janet Clarke Hall</a> in her honour and constituted as a separate college. In 1902, Clarke was elected as the inaugural president of the Victorian branch of the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Women%20of%20Australia">National Council of Women</a>. In 1904 she also became the inaugural president of the <a href="Australian%20Women%27s%20National%20League">Australian Women's National League</a>, a political lobby group for women's interests.

Death and legacy.
Clarke died at "Cliveden" on 28 April 1909, aged 57. She had been ill for about a year, suffering from <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a>, <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, and <a href="peritonitis">peritonitis</a> at various times. Clarke's funeral was held at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne">St Paul's Cathedral</a> and officiated by <a href="Lowther%20Clarke">Lowther Clarke</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Melbourne">Archbishop of Melbourne</a>. Throngs of wellwishers lined the streets during the funeral procession. She was buried at the <a href="Melbourne%20General%20Cemetery">Melbourne General Cemetery</a> next to her husband, who had predeceased in 1897. He was succeeded in the baronetage by <a href="Sir%20Rupert%20Clarke%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Rupert Clarke</a>, the oldest son from his first marriage.

Abbey Perkins Cheney

Abigail "Abbey" Perkins Cheney (born November 18, 1851) was a musical educator.

Early life.
Abbey (also Abigail or Abbie) Perkins was born on November 18, 1851, in <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, Wisconsin.

Perkins inherited her rare gifts through her mother, from a long line of singing ancestors, the Cheneys of Vermont, who for a hundred years had been famous for their fine and powerful voices and exceptional musical culture. Her mother, Elizabeth Ela Cheney (born February 23, 1823 in <a href="Brentwood%2C%20New%20York">Brentwood, New York</a>), had a remarkably pure and strong mezzo-soprano voice, and was very successful before her marriage touring with her brothers, as a church and concert singer in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>, and subsequently in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and in <a href="Leavenworth%2C%20Kansas">Leavenworth, Kansas</a>. In her old age, she still enjoyed the musical and literary pleasures of her daughter's San Francisco home.

Perkins's father, Charles Wesley Perkins, one of the enterprising young business men of Milwaukee in the 1850's, was also a music lover. He died in 1861, and his last words to his little daughter were: "Lose no opportunity to cultivate your musical talent." The father's wish decided the child's future: her mother encouraged and aided her daughter in every way.

Abbey Perkins, as a little girl, achieved such successes that, when only fourteen years old, she was called with her mother to take charge of the music in <a href="Ingham%20University">Ingham University</a>, <a href="LeRoy%2C%20New%20York">LeRoy, New York</a>. Two years later they resigned that position in order to go abroad for the prosecution of the daughter's musical studies. They went to Germany, where Perkins entered the <a href="University%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre%20Leipzig">Conservatory of Leipsic</a>, and also received private tuition from <a href="Louis%20Plaidy">Louis Plaidy</a>. During that year in Leipsic she was a pupil of <a href="Oscar%20Paul">Oscar Paul</a>, of <a href="Theodor%20Coccius">Theodor Coccius</a>, of <a href="Carl%20Reinecke">Carl Reinecke</a> and others on the piano, and of <a href="Ernst%20Richter">Ernst Richter</a> in harmony. But the best teachers in Leipsic were unsatisfactory in point of technique, and through the counsel of honest Coccius, as well as by advice of the master, <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, she went to Stuttgart to study with Sigismund Lebert, whom Liszt pronounced the greatest living teacher of technique. The school year at Stuttgart had just closed, and Perkins presented herself tremblingly to the master for examination, winning such favor that he offered to teach her, contrary to his custom, through vacation, going three times a week to his pupil's bouse and to the last refusing all compensation. When the school reopened, the young musician was admitted to the artists' class, and there for four years she studied with Lebert and with Priickner, the friend of Von Billow. Then, having received her diploma, she began in Germany her successful career as a musical educator. A term of study with Edward Neupert, the pupil of <a href="Theodor%20Kullak">Theodor Kullak</a>, closed her pupil life, but by no means ended her musical studies. 

First in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>, and later in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, Cheney was the pioneer of a new school of musical technique, and the signal success achieved by her pupils was proof conclusive that in her treatment of piano-playing, primarily from the physiological standpoint, she enlarged and improved the methods of her masters, Reinecke, Lebert and others. The physiological investigations, which made Cheney an originator in her field of work, were instigated by her own great suffering from partial paralysis of the right hand and arm, brought on by overtaxation when completing her studies abroad. Due to this fact she was a sympathetic broad-minded, self-sacrificing educator instead of a concert pianist. <a href="Ellen%20Browning%20Scripps">Ellen Browning Scripps</a> was one of her students.

Cheney is the author of "What It Is That Heals".

Personal life.
In 1876, when Abbey Perkins returned to America from Germany, she was courted by a young musician, poet and litterateur, <a href="John%20Vance%20Cheney">John Vance Cheney</a> (born December 29, 1848, in <a href="Groveland%2C%20New%20York">Groveland, New York</a>), whom she married and went to live together in California in 1876. They had two daughters, Janet Vance Cheney (born December 30, 1876) and Evelyn Hope Cheney (born September 19, 1881) and divorced in 1894.

Rock Fall (horse)

Rock Fall (foaled March 19, 2011 – October 10, 2014) is a racehorse best known for winning <a href="Alfred%20G.%20Vanderbilt%20Handicap">Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap</a>, and the <a href="Vosburgh%20Stakes">Vosburgh Stakes</a>

Background.
Rock Fall is a dark bay horse with no face markings and no leg markings. He was bought for $250,000 at the Fasig Tipton New York Saratoga 2012 Select Yearling Sale. His sire is <a href="Speightstown%20%28horse%29">Speightstown</a>, the winner of the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Sprint">Breeders Cup Sprint.</a> He also is the sire of <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Dirt%20Mile">Breeders Cup Dirt Mile</a> winner <a href="Tamarkuz">Tamarkuz</a>, and <a href="Jockey%20Club%20Gold%20Cup">Jockey Club Gold Cup</a> winner <a href="Haynesfield">Haynesfield</a>. Rock Fall's dam, Renda was second in the <a href="Forward%20Gal%20Stakes">Forward Gal</a>, and is by Medaglia d'Oro who won the <a href="Travers%20Stakes">Travers Stakes</a> and sired <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Racing%20and%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall Of Fame inductee</a> <a href="Rachel%20Alexandra">Rachel Alexandra</a>.

Three-Year-Old Season.
Rock Fall took a bit longer than other racehorses to begin racing. He did not run until April of his three-year-old season. But he finally made his debut at <a href="Gulfstream%20Park">Gulfstream Park</a>. Unfortunately his introduction to racing was less than stellar, as he broke a step slowly. He then went four wide in a desperate attempt to catch up. However, the move cost him all of his energy causing him to fall back in the pack. In the end, he would cross the finish eighth, 16 lengths behind the winner. It would be the only time Rock Fall ever lost.

His next start would be at <a href="Belmont%20Park">Belmont Park</a>, and it went a lot better. This time at the start, despite being slightly bumped, he rushed to the front and had the lead by the first quarter of a mile. For the rest of the race all Rock Fall did was widened his lead. At the wire, he had opened up the lead to a very impressive nine and three quarter lengths. Less than a month later, he was back for another race at Belmont Park. He started in fourth again but this time did not hustle immediately to the lead but stayed in third, three lengths behind the leader. By half a mile, Rock Fall, had gotten the lead at the far turn. He remarkably opened up six lengths but he geared down in the final furlong and finished three and a quarter lengths ahead.

Four-Year-Old Season.
After three races from April to June as a three year old, he planned to train at <a href="Saratoga%20Race%20Course">Saratoga</a> but he suffered multiple minor injuries which would force him to take nine months off. Finally, he returned as a four year old in another allowance. To begin the race, he settled off the leaders in seventh before moving up to sixth by the first quarter of a mile. Surprisingly in just a quarter of a mile he moved from sixth to second and was only a head behind the leader. By the far turn he had opened up one and a half lengths before holding on to win by one length at the wire. Just a month later he would be back and running in his last allowance race of his career. He stayed very close behind the leader by just one length. He then took the lead by half a mile in. The rest of the race was just opening up the lead to a whopping nine lengths, defeating <a href="New%20Orleans%20Handicap">New Orleans Handicap</a> winner Nate's Mineshaft.

After such domination of allowance races, Rock Fall made his graded stakes debut in the True North Stakes. Due to his overwhelming victory in his last start, he was the 6-5 favorite even though he had never ran in a stakes race before. It looked as though he did not disappoint, starting fifth and then quickly moving up to third by the first quarter of a mile. After that, he quickly passed everybody barely having the lead by the far turn. For the rest of the race he opened up his lead and slowly ran away from the competition – winning by three and a three quarter lengths and defeating two-time <a href="Carter%20Handicap">Carter Handicap</a> winner Dads Caps.

Next he went up in class again when he ran in the G1 <a href="Alfred%20G.%20Vanderbilt%20Handicap">Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap</a> running up against <a href="H.%20Allen%20Jerkens%20Memorial%20Stakes">Kings Bishop Stakes</a> winner The Big Beast. At the start, the Big Beast and Favorite Tale fought for the early lead while Rock Fall stayed behind in fourth and then third. By the far turn Favorite Tale had the lead but then began to fade, letting The Big Beast take over the lead. Then out of the blue, Rock Fall took off and got the lead by a nose. Then The Big Beast had the lead. Their two heads were Inseparable and at the wire it was too close to call. After minutes of waiting the race was official. The Big Beast had lost by a nose and Rock Fall would be victorious

After little less than two months of rest, he made his second G1 appearance in the <a href="Vosburgh%20Stakes">Vosburgh Stakes</a>. He also had one more big challenger in Palace, who won the Alfred G Vanderbilt Handicap as well as the <a href="Forego%20Handicap">Forego Stakes</a>. It was a battle between two G1 winners. However, Rock Fall was much preferred and was bet down to the 2-5 favorite. Rock Fall started out fourth and then third early but he stayed very close to the leaders, only a length behind Wildcat Red and Weekend Hideaway. By the far turn, Rock Fall was only a head behind and was with three other horses running only heads apart. Soon Wildcat Red faded and it became a three-horse race, then a two-horse race. Stallwakin Dude and Rock Fall were head to head then Rock Fall began to slowly inch away until he was half a length in front. Then out the blue, Salutos Amigos flew late and was about to pass Rock Fall, but Rock Fall fought back the late challenge and was the winner by just a neck.

Death.
After such success the plan was to work out until the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Sprint">Breeders Cup Sprint</a>. His workout went well but right after the workout he broke down and broke both of his front legs. He was euthanized almost Immediately. Later Stonestreet said on twitter "We are heartbroken to confirm our Rock Fall sustained a life-ending training injury this morning at Keeneland."

Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art

The Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art is a private museum open to the public. The project was initiated in November 2014, and is inaugurated on 8 April 2016. His collection is the world's largest collection of works by the radical conceptualists <a href="Art%20%26amp%3B%20Language">Art & Language</a>, who has played an important role in the invention of conceptual art. This permanent collection, gathered over the past 25 years by <a href="Philippe%20M%C3%A9aille">Philippe Méaille</a>, is intended to be exhibited at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Montsoreau">Château de Montsoreau</a>, but also to be lent to other institutions. The Philippe Méaille collection has also been on long-term loan since 2010 at the <a href="Barcelona%20Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art">MACBA</a> of Barcelona, which brings the two institutions to collaborate regularly. 

History.
The first long-term loan of the Philippe Méaille collection with the MACBA is the subject of a retrospective exhibition Art & Language Uncompleted: The Philippe Méaille Collection in October 2014. This exhibition come together with a catalog produced in close collaboration with the artists of Art & Language (Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden), as well as academics such as Carles Guerra (chief curator at <a href="Barcelona%20Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art">MACBA</a>) and Matthew Jesse Jackson (Professor in the Department of Visual Arts and Art History at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>).

Philippe Méaille, who has lived for 15 years in Anjou, works in parallel with Christian Gillet, the president of the department of <a href="Maine-et-Loire">Maine-et-Loire</a>, to study the possibility of creating a <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art">museum of contemporary art</a> in <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a>, and to install his collection in the château de Montsoreau, a then departmental property. After six months of studies of the alternative offers, leaks in the press install a polemic. Frédéric Béatse, then head of the left wing list in the regional elections, regrets that the right-wing majority of the department of Maine-et-Loire is « throwing away the family jewels. » «This is all the more shocking, Jacques Auxiette (then president of the Region <a href="Pays%20de%20la%20Loire">Pays de la Loire</a>) had proposed to the Department council a partnership between the <a href="Fontevraud%20Abbey">Abbey of Fontevraud</a> and <a href="Montsoreau">Montsoreau</a> to make this <a href="Saumur">Saumur</a> area even more attractive. » Christian Gillet, president of the department of Maine-et-Loire made his decision on Friday, June 19, 2015 and gave the keys of the Château de Montsoreau to Philippe Méaille through an emphyteutic lease of 25 years. At the same time he engaged a reflection on contemporary art as a cultural and touristic priority for the development of Maine-et-Loire.

Restoration works.
At the beginning of the 20th century the castle of Montsoreau is almost a ruin. It is saved by an active policy of acquisitions and restoration of the department of Maine-et-Loire under the direction of the bâtiments de France. The last work undertaken concerned the upgrading and accessibility of the historical monument for all the publics. The public with reduced mobility can gain access to almost the entire castle and all the exhibitions thanks to an elevator.

A restaurant was opened in August 2016.

A library of books on the history of art, contemporary creation and applied arts is open to the public in August 2016.

Electricity was upgraded, as well as fire extinguishing equipment and fire detection equipment.

The lighting benefits from the latest technical developments and has <a href="Light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> (Light Emitting Diode) on all its reception and exhibition spaces.

Limewash, which is extremely degraded, has been recovered with traditional lime-blossom. These whitewashes, common in châteaux of the Loire Valley, have the virtue of installing a constant hygrometry.

Roof revision work was carried out.

During the redevelopment of a former storage room, the masons have updated a chimney dating from about 1450. This chimney is currently being studied in collaboration with the bâtiments de France to be restored. These works allow the Château de Montsoreau-musée d'art contemporain to have at present 2,000 m2 of exhibition space.

The château de Montsoreau-Museum of contemporary art pier reopens at the end of May 2017 after several months of work, to allow its visitors to arrive by boat.

Architecture.
Only Château de la Loire to be a museum of contemporary art, the castle of Montsoreau is for more than a thousand years the gate of Anjou. Historically built by one of the ambassadors of <a href="Charles%20VII%20of%20France">Charles VII King of France</a>, <a href="John%20II%20of%20Chambes">John II of Chambes</a> is the first of Kingdom’s Lords, with <a href="Jacques%20C%C5%93ur">Jacques Cœur</a> to install the Italian <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> in France. He built the Château de Montsoreau between 1443 and 1453, directly in contact with the Loire, like venetian palaces built at the same period.

In the middle of the Loire Valley, listed as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO, its public is composed of an international clientele as well as a French clientele from Anjou and Touraine

Collection.
The Philippe Méaille collection, which constitutes the collection of the museum, is installed on the first two floors of the museum. It is composed exclusively of works by the artists group Art & Language. An agreement with the Tate Modern, London authorizes the screening of a film co-produced by this institution and the Bloomberg foundation in the exhibition spaces of the Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art. Founded in 1968, Art & Langage – which takes its name from the eponymous newspaper Art-Language – is made up of British, American and Australian. Their corrosive questions about the status of the artist, the work of art or even the institution itself make them seen as the most radical figures in the history of art of the second half of the twentieth century. This collective, at the origin of what is now called conceptual art is still active and currently represented by Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden.

Between 1965 to now, up to fifty artists have joined or collaborated with Art & Language, including: Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin, Ian Burn, Charles Harrison, Joseph Kosuth, 28 Sol LeWitt, Philip Pilkington, Mel Ramsden, Dave Rushton, Lynn Lemaster, Mayo Thompson, Kathryn Bigelow, Dan Graham and Lawrence Weiner. In 1977, when Mayo Thompson, leader of the band The Red Krayola left the collective, it was composed of Michael Baldwin, Charles Harrison and Mel Ramsden. The Philippe Méaille collection is presented in such a multiplicity of media (paintings, sculptures, drawings, manuscripts, tapuscrits, installations and videos) that Carles Guerra will say of it: « besides being affected by the artists' attitude, The Philippe Méaille Collection is further affected by the archaeological perspective with which it was assembled » .800 works from the Philippe Méaille collection are still on long-term loan at <a href="Barcelona%20Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art">MACBA</a> since 2010. In 2014, MACBA devotes a major retrospective exhibition to Art & Language, under the direction of Carles Guerra: "Art & Language uncompleted: The Philippe Méaille Collection".

Exhibitions.
Temporary exhibitions are givng an access to contemporary art from 1965 to today.


Events.
Since its opening, the Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art collaborates with the National days of Books and Wine in Saumur, to reward an art writer with the <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Morellet">François Morellet</a> price.
In 2017, the gardens of the castle, located on the banks of the Loire have been transformed into wild gardens. On more than one hectare, the garden gives way to freedom and biodiversity, a peaceful, inspiring and perpetually evolving place. Passionate about nature, <a href="Miriam%20Rothschild">Miriam Rothschild</a> (1908–2005) devoted all of her life to her scientific research and literally cleared the traditional approach of gardens to create "natural" gardens. Its Ashton Wold property, located in the north of London, was a real laboratory for conducting environmental experiments and creating these "wildgardens", nowadays so widespread. Leaving technique, chemistry and interventionism, the wild garden favors the sociability of native plants and preserves the surrounding fauna. It proposes a new balance between fauna and flora.

Federal Chancellery (Bonn)

The <a href="Federal%20Chancellery%20%28Germany%29">Federal Chancellery</a> Building in <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a> was used from 1976 to 1999 as the <a href="Federal%20Chancellery%20%28Germany%29">Federal Chancellery</a> of the <a href="Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a>, and since 2006 as the seat of the <a href="Federal%20Ministry%20for%20Economic%20Cooperation%20and%20Development">Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>. It is located in the district of <a href="Gronau%20%28Bonn%29">Gronau</a> east of <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%209">Bundesstraße 9</a> () and west of the <a href="Bundeshaus%20%28Bonn%29">Bundeshaus</a> and is part of the <a href="Route%20of%20Democracy">Route of Democracy</a>.

In 1999, the headquarters of the Federal Chancellery was moved to Berlin under the <a href="Berlin-Bonn%20Act">Berlin-Bonn Act</a>, first into the <a href="Staatsratsgeb%C3%A4ude">Staatsratsgebäude</a>, then to the <a href="German%20Chancellery">new building</a> on the ; the second seat of the Federal Chancellery has been the <a href="Palais%20Schaumburg">Palais Schaumburg</a> since 2001. The area of the former Federal Chancellery is a <a href="Monument%20Protection%20Act%20%28North%20Rhine-Westphalia%29">monument</a> under <a href="Deutsche%20Stiftung%20Denkmalschutz">monument protection</a>. 

History.
The first building to serve as the Chancellery of the Federal Republic was the <a href="Palais%20Schaumburg">Palais Schaumburg</a> in Bonn from 1949 onwards. In 1954/55, "supplementary buildings" ("Old Chancellery") were built as "Houses 2 and 3". In 1969, the <a href="social-liberal%20coalition">social-liberal coalition</a> under <a href="Willy%20Brandt">Willy Brandt</a> and his chancellor <a href="Horst%20Ehmke">Horst Ehmke</a> was expanded to include various aspects of education, social and technology policy. In order to meet the growing requirements, for which the extended grounds of the palace had become too small, the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Germany">Federal Government</a> decided in December 1969, to build a new chancellery building immediately south of the old one on the so-called 'Görreswiese' in the immediate vicinity of the <a href="Press%20and%20Information%20Office%20of%20the%20Federal%20Government%20%28Bonn%29">Press and Information Office of the Federal Government</a>. Planning was the task of the <a href="Planning%20Group%20Stieldorf">Planning Group Stieldorf</a>, which was the winner of a contest open to the public as a winner. A separate competition took place for the artistic design of the buildings and the outdoor area. Construction began in 1973 and in July 1976 the architecturally simple new building was inaugurated. The Palais Schaumburg was still used, but primarily for purposes of representation, and the "Old Chancellery" was taken over by the <a href="Ausw%C3%A4rtiges%20Amt">Auswärtiges Amt</a> The park, with a central driveway from Görresstraße, surrounds a third building, the <a href="Kanzlerbungalow">Kanzlerbungalow</a>, which served as the official residence of the Federal Chancellor.

The Federal Chancellery consists of a three-storey complex with two lower floors, which is divided into two parts: the so-called "department building" and the "chancery and cabinet building". The department building is built on a ground raster, which produces almost 100 square meters of supporting surfaces in the interior, and is entered by the main entrance on the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> side (in the east). To the north of the department building is the much smaller chancery and cabinet building with separate entrance. The ground floor facades are largely recessed and fully glazed in order to provide the best possible view into the old park landscape behind (at the time of planning, there were still plans to make the site accessible to the public).

The free steel skeleton construction (with only six concrete cores as fixed points) allows the adaptation to all organizational requirements by means of variable walls. The low - rise development (below the crowns of the park and the first of the Palais Schaumburg) - with a new volume of more than 200,000 cubic meters, 30,000 m² of floor space and 13,000 m² of façade - justified the decision of the Jury for price and execution.

The architectural quality of the building was controversial. Critics criticized against this "indecisive and reserved" urban development. Federal Chancellor <a href="Helmut%20Schmidt">Helmut Schmidt</a> is attributed the quotation that the building has the "charm of a Rhineland savings bank". But the "urban redevelopment", certain <a href="purism">purism</a> <a href="aesthetics">aesthetic</a> qualities demanded in the competition tender of the <a href="Federal%20Building%20Administration">Federal Building Administration</a> and also the functional analysis of the internal structure (fully flexible ground plans) highlighted.

In 1979, Helmut Schmidt, the first occupier of the building, transformed the forecourt of the new building, creating a large green area where the sculpture " <a href="Two%20Large%20Forms">Two Large Forms</a>" by <a href="Henry%20Moore">Henry Moore</a>) was installed. In May 1982 a bust of <a href="Konrad%20Adenauer">Konrad Adenauer</a>, who became the symbol of the <a href="Bonn%20Republic">Bonn Republic</a>, was erected on the nearby " Chancellor's Place ".

In the wake of the <a href="capital%20decision">capital decision</a>, the Federal Chancellery moved to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> with its headquarters in 1999. In the Bonn Federal Chancellery building, a second service was left, which was transferred to the Palais Schaumburg in May 2001. At the same time, the building was handed over to the <a href="Federal%20Ministry%20for%20Economic%20Cooperation%20and%20Development">Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> (BMZ) with the 'Haus 2' '(' 'Property Adenauerallee Süd' '). In order to enable the Ministry to move into the property, a comprehensive generalization was implemented during the period from 1999 to 2005, with a total of one of the largest <a href="asbestos%20recovery">asbestos recovery</a> measures implemented in Germany. The BMZ moved from the "Bonn Karree" south of the <a href="Museumsmeile">Museumsmeile</a> to the former Chancellery.

Biography.
Herman was born in New York City to Ruth and Robert Herman. Her mother was a secretary and father a union organizer and professional fund-raiser. Her brother is physicist Jay Herman. Herman attended Flushing High School in Queens until 1962, after which she studied history at <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a>. While a senior at Cornell, Herman was "the first woman to live at <a href="Telluride%20House">Telluride House</a> under the new arrangements" after "Convention for the first time was able to grant full residential preferment to an undergraduate woman." There she lived alongside fellow house members <a href="Gayatri%20Chakravorty%20Spivak">Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak</a>, <a href="Clare%20Selgin%20Wolfowitz">Clare Selgin Wolfowitz</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Wolfowitz">Paul Wolfowitz</a>, as well as in-house faculty members that included the 4th <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Labor">United States Secretary of Labor</a> <a href="Frances%20Perkins">Frances Perkins</a> and the British philosopher <a href="Paul%20Grice">Paul Grice</a>. She has since taught <a href="Telluride%20Association%20Summer%20Program">Telluride Association Summer Program (TASP)</a> seminars at <a href="Deep%20Springs%20College">Deep Springs College</a> and the Cornell branch.

Shortly after graduated from Cornell with a B.A. in 1966, Herman began doctoral studies in the history program at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. Soon, however, she discovered her affinity for philosophy and transferred to the Philosophy Department, but not before taking an M.A. in Modern European History. Studying under <a href="Stanley%20Cavell">Stanley Cavell</a> and <a href="John%20Rawls">John Rawls</a>, Herman wrote a dissertation entitled "Morality as Rationality: A Study of Kant's Ethics" in 1976.

Of Herman's time at Harvard, <a href="Martha%20Nussbaum">Martha Nussbaum</a> said during her introduction to the Dewey Lecture at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago%20Law%20School">University of Chicago Law School</a>:On a personal note I remember feeling the power of that captivating presence on the memorable occasion when I first heard Barbara Herman speak. She probably doesn't remember this at all, but she was an older graduate student at Harvard and she was famous among us younger graduate students as one of the best, but I had never really met her or heard her even talk. And on this occasion she was addressing the whole faculty of the Harvard philosophy department about why the graduate students wanted to form a union. And I remember—and this is a pretty daunting occasion with <a href="Willard%20Van%20Orman%20Quine">Van Quine</a>, <a href="Nelson%20Goodman">Nelson Goodman</a> and all these people sitting there who were actually not very friendly to the idea of a graduate student union—but I remember the confidence, incisiveness, and great humor with which she faced down that group, and I remember thinking: this is a truly wise person as well as one who is a lot of fun.From 1973-1980 Herman was assistant professor at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, before joining the faculty at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>, first as a Visiting Assistant Professor and subsequently as an Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and finally Professor of Philosophy and Law in 1992. In 1994 Herman was appointed Griffin Professor of Philosophy at <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a> and in 2006 was jointly appointed to the law school.

Some of Herman's own doctoral students include <a href="Henry%20Rutgers">Henry Rutgers</a> University Professor of Philosophy <a href="Frances%20Kamm">Frances Kamm</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a> Professor <a href="Harry%20Brighouse">Harry Brighouse</a>, <a href="Pomona%20College">Pomona College</a> Associate Professor Julie Tannenbaum, <a href="UT%20Knoxville">UT Knoxville</a> Assistant Professor Jon Garthoff, <a href="UCSB">UCSB</a> Assistant Professor E. Sonny Elizondo, and <a href="Northwestern%20University">Northwestern</a> Assistant Professor Stephen White.

Work.
In a review of "The Practice of Moral Judgment", Kant scholar <a href="Paul%20Guyer">Paul Guyer</a> writes of Herman's work:Herman succeeds in presenting an interpretation of Kant’s ethics that shows it to be a powerful alternative to the empiricist utilitarian, neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics, and the post-modernist individualist or existentialist ethical theories which have enjoyed such prominence in recent years… What [Herman] has given us is a deeply compelling picture of both the structure and power of Kant’s regulative ideal of moral deliberation, and that is much to be grateful for indeed.And on her collection of essays entitled "Moral Literacy", philosopher <a href="Stephen%20Darwall">Stephen Darwall</a> writes:Rawls pointed out that it was one of Hegel’s aims to overcome the many dualisms that he thought disfigured Kant’s transcendental idealism. Herman’s essays, in my view, are distinctive for this same emphasis. Throughout, she stresses continuities where more orthodox Kantian thought insists on separation. And she argues that Kant’s central insights are not only preserved, but improved, when one appreciates these continuities. Thus, where orthodox Kantian thought sharply distinguishes desire from reason, love from reason, particular judgment from principle, and so on, Herman argues that these pairs should all be seen as continuous and interconnected "and" that a Kantian take on ethics is enhanced by so viewing them. She is tough-minded and rigorous, philosophically. And she doesn’t waste words. Herman has an economy of expression and a penchant for illuminating philosophical coinage.To which legal theorist Lawrence Solum adds on his blog:In my opinion, Herman's recent work represents the very best of contemporary moral philosophy in the tradition of Kant--only a handful of scholars combine her deep appreciation of Kant, philosophical rigor, and genuine intellectual flexibility.  A superb book.  What I can I add to Darwall's high praise, except to say, "Highly Recommended!"In 2014 Herman delivered the The Dewey Lectureship in Jurisprudence at the University of Chicago Law School entitled "The Moral Side of Non-Negligence."

120th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery

120th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (120th HAA Rgt) was an air defence unit of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Raised in early 1941, it served to protect <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a> and <a href="London">London</a> before proceeding overseas in 1943. It provided anti-aircraft (AA) cover over <a href="British%20Cyprus">Cyprus</a> until its disbandment in 1944.

South Wales.
The regiment was formed in <a href="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a> at the height of <a href="The%20Blitz">The Blitz</a> in January and February 1941 with three newly-raised batteries (381, 384, 386 HAA Btys). It came under the command of <a href="61st%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">61 AA Brigade</a> in <a href="9th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">9 AA Division</a>, and at the beginning of March 384 HAA Bty relieved 174 HAA Bty of <a href="85th%20%28Tees%29%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">85th (Tees) HAA Rgt</a> at gunsites O1 (defending <a href="ROF%20Pembrey">Royal Ordnance Factory Pembrey</a>) and P6 (West Pennar defending the oil terminal at <a href="Pembroke%20Dock">Pembroke Dock</a>). These were equipped with four <a href="QF%203-inch%2020%20cwt">3-inch</a> and four <a href="QF%203.7-inch%20AA%20gun">3.7-inch</a> guns respectively and were under the operational command of <a href="79th%20%28Hertfordshire%20Yeomanry%29%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Rgt</a>.

However, the batteries were soon moved eastwards to bolster the Gun Defence Area (GDA) around <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a>, which had been badly hit by "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" raids on three successive nights in February (the <a href="Swansea%20Blitz">Swansea Blitz</a>). Half of 384 HAA Bty took over site O2 at <a href="Llanelli">Llanelli</a> with four 3-inch guns on 19 March, and on 24 March the detachments at Pembrey were ordered to take their guns and set up a new temporary site designated N12, approximately one mile west of <a href="Jersey%20Marine">Jersey Marine</a>. Next the detachments at Llanelli moved their guns to N9, north-east of <a href="Port%20Talbot">Port Talbot</a> and reported ready for action on 5 April. On 18 April 386 HAA Bty also came under the operational command of 79th (HY) HAA Rgt. By the end of April, 120th HAA Rgt was responsible for the following positions under 79th (HY) HAA Rgt in the Swansea GDA:

By now, the Blitz was nearing its end. All the enemy activity in April consisted of raids passing over South Wales on their way to attack targets elsewhere, with the guns being engaged on the nights of 3/4, 7/8 and 15/16 April, the latter night being a long engagement giving the gunners good practice in firing at 'unseen' targets under control of <a href="GL%20Mk.%20I%20radar">GL Mk. I radar</a> while the bombers crossed the area northwards and then returned southwards. Engagements the following month were also sporadic, with the guns firing on 4/5, 7/8 and 11/12 May (regarded as the last night of the Blitz).

Between June and August the batteries handed over their responsibilities to 79th (HY) HAA Rgt and returned to the command of 120th HAA Rgt, which was ordered to leave South Wales and join <a href="26th%20%28London%29%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade">26 (London) AA Bde</a> in <a href="1st%20Anti-Aircraft%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1 AA Division</a> defending London. On 21 August the regiment was joined by the experienced <a href="248th%20%28Welwyn%29%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Battery%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">248 (Welwyn) HAA Bty</a> transferred from 79th (HY) HAA Rgt. The Welwyn Battery was a prewar <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> unit that had seen heavy action during the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a> in 1940 and the <a href="Swansea%20Blitz">Swansea Blitz</a> in February 1941.

London.
In London the regiment and its four batteries (248, 381, 384, 386) took over gunsites in the northern part of the London Inner Artillery Zone (IAZ). For example, on 21 August 248 (Welwyn) HAA Bty took over two static four-gun 3.7-inch sites:
Routine moves over the following months saw 248 Bty occupying the following sites at various times:
120th HAA Regiment remained in and around London for over a year, serving through the desultory "Luftwaffe" raids of 1942.

In October 1942, 386 HAA Bty left the regiment and joined a new <a href="175th%20Heavy%20Anti-Aircraft%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">175th HAA Rgt</a> that was being formed. 386 HAA Battery later served with 175th HAA Rgt in defence of <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. Then in mid-January 1943, 120th HAA Rgt moved out of 26 AA Bde's area and came under direct <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> control to mobilise for overseas service as a defended ports unit on a three-battery establishment (248, 381, 384 Btys).

Cyprus.
After two months at the mobilisation centre at <a href="Easthampstead">Easthampstead</a> in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> the regiment sailed from <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on 14 March and disembarked at <a href="Port%20Tewfik">Port Tewfik</a> in <a href="Egypt%23British_protectorate_.281882.E2.80.931952.29">Egypt</a> on 6 May. Here it came under the command of <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Forces</a>. After a month in Egypt it was moved by railway to <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> and then by sea to <a href="British%20Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, where it landed on 14 June to take over AA defence of ports and airfields on the island under <a href="20th%20Anti-Aircraft%20Brigade%20%29United%20Kingdom%29">20 AA Bde</a> in <a href="Ninth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ninth Army</a>.

248 (Welwyn) Battery was initially deployed as follows:

At the end of June 1943 the regiment was changed to a semi-mobile establishment. In early July, A Trp of 248 Bty moved to <a href="Famagusta">Famagusta</a> and then to <a href="Limassol">Limassol</a> in mid-August, while B Trp moved to <a href="Paphos">Paphos</a> in mid-August. In addition, detachments from 248 battery manned guns on the island of <a href="Kastellorizo">Castelrosso</a>, at that time the only island of the <a href="Dodecanese%20campaign">Dodecanese</a> in <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> hands.

At the end of October 1943, the regiment was 'diluted' (as the process was officially described) by a draft of <a href="Basuto">Basuto</a> troops from the African Pioneer Corps to be trained as gunners, releasing a similar number of British Other Ranks for duties elsewhere. The state of readiness in Cyprus was relaxed in March 1944 and the AA defences on the island were run down during April. The remaining personnel moved to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> where 120th HAA Rgt was disbanded in May–June 1944.

<doc id="54879231" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54879231" title="Mental Health Stigmas in the African American Community">
Mental Health Stigmas in the African American Community

Mental Health Stigmas in the Black Community.
Today mental health has developed into a comprehensive field where providers work with a range of ages, cultures, and illnesses (Tate, 2017). Treatments for <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a> issues come in many forms and are offered in many communities. In communities where mental health care is available, community members do not always take advantage of services. Anywhere from 40–60% of those in need of mental health services, do not use them (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008). This happens for a number of reasons. Mental health care providers do not work in every community for affordable rates for that community, so treatment accessibility is still an issue. When people cannot afford to easily pay the total cost of needed mental health care services out of pocket or with the aid of health care insurance, then they are less likely to seek any services at all (Nadeem, Lange, Edge, Fongwa, Belin, & Miranda, 2007). In addition to financial restrictions, sometimes community members perceive seeking services in negative ways because their cultural values do not align with definitions of western medicine and its practices. In the African American community, for example, mental health is a contested topic (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008).

What the Stigmas Are & Why They Developed.
Members of the black community seek services and complete treatment less often than their white counterparts (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008). Even when services are accessible, potential services users will avoid treatment for <a href="mental%20distress">mental distress</a>. This is done in an attempt to maintain social status. In the black community, needing mental health care services is perceived as socially undesirable and leads to negative social consequences (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008). These consequences can include family disapproval and being negatively viewed by others in the community (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008). In a qualitative study focusing on stigmas among black consumers, 41% of people recognized they needed treatment, but still could not persuade their families that a real condition existed (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008). Without family support in the terms of acknowledgement, black consumers were hesitant to start treatment. In addition to lower-acceptance of mental health illness as a medical condition, stigmas affect African Americans differently. Black men experience more stigmas related to needing services than women do, causing them to delay seeking care for longer periods of time (Dockey.…Clement, 2015) . Regardless of gender, seeking mental health care services in not an encouraged action. 

<a href="Stigmas">Stigmas</a> have been attached to the action of seeking treatment for various reasons. Most stigmas are related to the questions of why does <a href="mental%20illness">mental illness</a> happen and what causes it (Dockey.…Clement, 2015). Some beliefs about mental illness include that it stems from individual weaknesses or sinful lifestyles [defined as negative behaviors viewed within a religious context] (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008). It is also possible that needing treatment is associated with the idea of confinement, as services historically were another way to deny liberties to African Americans, leading blacks to fear the consequences of seeking care outside of personal social motivators (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008). One study found that black clients were 23% more likely than their white counterparts to receive diagnoses after interactions with the criminal justice system (Bhui, Ullrich, & Coid, 2014). The association between the justice system and mental health care lays the foundation for fear and suspicion, ruining trust in a service that is supposed to help its consumers. Collectively, community members believe that mental illness is the individual’s fault and responsibility to fix without formal medical treatment (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008).

Looking Forward.
It is important for care givers to remember that African Americans face stigma for seeking services and have been socialized to believe needing treatment is a sign of wrong-doing (Alvidrez, Snowden, & Kaiser, 2008). Cultural values influence the ways blacks and other ethnic minorities view mental health care, their willingness to participate in treatments, and acceptance of mental illnesses’ impact on their community specifically. When members of the black community receive services from culturally competent and effective providers, they are more willing to complete treatments and report higher satisfaction with services (Blank, Mahmood, Fox, & Guterbock, 2002).

Studies have also found that African Americans recognize illness and seek treatment at higher rates when services are community led (Knifton, Gervais, Newbigging, Mirza, Quinn, Wilson, & Hunkins-Hutchison, 2013). In a study observing the effectiveness of community led approaches in comparison to the benefits of public education efforts, 80% of participants reported learning more about mental health when participating in the former (Knifton et al, 2013). Such services can be effective because they understand and act according to the values that community holds. Churches or non-profits that work within certain areas have already developed strong ties with community members (Blank, Mahmood, Fox, & Guterbock, 2002). When appropriate, service providers should partner with local organizations to provide care to black communities in a way that they trust and respect. Community led approaches lead to service providers gaining part of the trust, knowledge, and respect local organizations already have (Blank, Mahmood, Fox, & Guterbock, 2002). When working with communities of color and the black community specifically, service providers need to be aware of stigmas and cultural values that influence their interactions with potential service seekers (Knifton, Gervais, Newbigging, Mirza, Quinn, Wilson, & Hunkins-Hutchison, 2013). Culturally mindful practices lead to higher rates of health for clients and success for care providers.

PS Waverley (1899)

PS "Waverley" was a <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a> built <a href="A.%20%26amp%3B%20J.%20Inglis">A. & J. Inglis</a> for the <a href="North%20British%20Steam%20Packet%20Co.">North British Steam Packet Co.</a> at their Pointhouse shipyard on the <a href="River%20Clyde">Clyde</a> in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The ship was designed to be the flagship of the North British Steam Packet Co. fleet with the intention that it could be used for regular Clyde services but also to help the company expand their initial foray into excursions in areas around <a href="Isle%20of%20Bute">Bute</a>, <a href="Isle%20of%20Arran">Arran</a>, <a href="Kintyre">Kintyre</a> and <a href="Loch%20Fyne">Loch Fyne</a>. She was launched on 30 May 1899 and entered service on 10 July 1899.

In 1902, North British Steam Packet Co was dissolved and "Waverley" was transferred to the ownership of its parent company <a href="North%20British%20Railway">North British Railway</a> operating a smaller range of routes that didn't include Kintyre, Loch Fyne and the west of Arran. Like many Clyde steamers, "Waverley" was requisitioned in 1915 by the Admiralty for service during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, being modified to increase her decked area and adding bow plating. For four years she served on the British and Belgian coasts, and was discharged from service in April 1919. She spent over a year being renovated for her return to service, with the most obvious change being the repositioning of her bridge from its original location between her paddle boxes to a new location in front of her funnel. She was returned to her owners on 9 July 1920.

As the <a href="Transport%20Act%201921">Transport Act 1921</a> took effect in 1923, "Waverley" was transferred again as North British Railway was merged into <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a>. In 1931 the "Waverley" was superseded as the fleet's flagship by the newly launched <a href="PS%20Jeanie%20Deans">PS "Jeanie Deans"</a>, but was renovated in 1923 with the addition of shelters on the promenade deck and remodelled interior passengers spaces to bring her up to the same standard as more modern steamers like the "Jeanie Deans". By the late 1930s decreasing passenger numbers on the Clyde estuary resulted in other steamers being moved to service routes elsewhere, and the "Waverley" was removed from service in 1939.

With the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> she was brought briefly back into service to evacuate children from Glasgow to areas on the Clyde coast, and was then requisitioned by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> to serve as the lead ship of the 12th Minesweeping Flotilla. The flotilla consisted of five paddle steamers, was based out of <a href="Harwich">Harwich</a> on the east coast of <a href="England">England</a>, and tasked with sweeping the shipping lanes. On 28 May, 1940, their flotilla was given orders to stock up and sail south to take part in <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">Operation Dynamo</a>, the effort to evacuate Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. The next day the ship was intercepted by 12 German <a href="Heinkel">Heinkel</a>s while returning to England with 600 troops on board. After avoiding their bombs for about 30 minutes, one struck the port side of the ship and opened a 6 foot hole in the bottom of the ship. The ship sank near Kwint Bank Buoy with the loss of some crew and about 400 troops. 158 survivors were pulled from the water by the "Cyclone", 285 by the PS "Golden Eagle", and a Dutch tugboat Java and two drifters picked up a few more.

The current <a href="PS%20Waverley">PS "Waverley"</a>, launched in 1946, was built as a replacement for this vessel.

An Atheist in the FOXhole

An Atheist in the FOXhole: A Liberal's Eight-Year Odyssey Inside the Heart of the Right-Wing Media is a 2013 memoir by <a href="Joe%20Muto">Joe Muto</a>, a man with <a href="Liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal political views</a> who worked for <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a> for eight years, that was published by <a href="E.%20P.%20Dutton">E. P. Dutton</a>.

Contents.
Muto, a graduate of <a href="Notre%20Dame%20University">Notre Dame University</a>, started work at Fox as a production assistant and became an associate producer for <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>'s show. He was fired due to leaking information to <a href="Gawker">Gawker</a>. Gawker paid him $5,000 for the material. Muto pleaded guilty to two <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charges: attempted computer tampering and attempted theft. He was sentenced to over 200 hours of community service and a fine of $1,000; he also gave up all of the funds Gawker paid him to the court.

The book switches back and forth between his firing and the chronology of his time at Fox. Calvin Terbeek of the "<a href="Houston%20Press">Houston Press</a>" wrote that the initial parts of the book largely discusses the general management style of cable news, and that the Fox-specific content larely appears after Muto is brought on to <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>'s program; according to Terbeek, the book focuses more on O'Reilly than on <a href="Sean%20Hannity">Sean Hannity</a>.

The "<a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>" stated that "His book isn't a diatribe, and is often funny. He knows there are stories some of his former colleagues won't like, but Muto is hard on himself, too." According to the AP, it has "a detailed character study of O'Reilly". Eric Deggans of the "<a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Times">Tampa Bay Times</a>" stated that "media nerds" would find interest in the content about O'Reilly.

Reception.
Andrew Mueller of "<a href="The%20New%20Humanist">The New Humanist</a>" wrote that Muto is "a breezy, amiable storyteller who manages to turn a yarn that could easily have been a magazine article into an altogether readable book that rarely feels padded."

Nicky Woolf of "<a href="The%20New%20Statesman">The New Statesman</a>" argued that the book has few new revelations about Fox News figures, and that it was "insightful, if a little underwhelming."

Deggans wrote that "I found the middle sections a compelling, detailed look at how cable's top anchor chooses stories and develops his onscreen image."

Terbeek describes the book as "a liberal's beach book read: light, easy and mostly fun." He criticizes the author's attempts at humor within the book's first 75 pages. He argued that political conservatives may enjoy reading the book for gossip presented on Fox News personalities and on the information on how cable news networks are operated.

Amy Height (c.1866 – 21 March, 1913) was an <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">American</a> music hall entertainer in the UK. She was an unusual black actor and comedian who introduced herself to British audiences first in <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> and also in straight theatre.

Life.
Height was born in <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> in about 1866. In 1886 she was acting in Barnsley in northern England. In 1883 she was in the pantomime Robinson Crusoe as his "squaw", Topsy. The critics favourable described her powerful singing voice and her comic delivery.

She became a music-hall entertainer in the UK.

She was an unusual black actor who introduced herself to British audiences first in <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> and also in straight theatre. She was described a "beautiful octaroon" when in Cardiff who was "the only" black female music hall actor. This is not likely. Roles were created for black actors by the popularity of Uncle Tom's Cabin.

Individual Philosophy

Introduction.
 The ideas disclosed below are taken from the works of <a href="Alan%20Watts">Alan Watts</a>, <a href="Andy%20Weir">Andy Weir</a>, <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href="Wilfred%20Thesiger">Wilfred Thesiger</a>
1.What is Individual Philosophy?
<br>
<br>Individual Philosophy is a branch of philosophy associated with <a href="meditation">meditation</a>, wholeness and <a href="Philosophy%20of%20self">Philosophy of self</a>. 
<br>
<br>Individual philosophy is not an idea. If it was, then it would be so hard to grasp that when you did it would slip out your hands like a bar of soap; it would be like trying to bite your own teeth.
<br> It would be like trying to breath naturally, or blink frequently - once you have grasped it, you've lost all the innocence that it held in the first place. But those are metaphors. Really, it is an understanding so deep and so fulfilled that it makes you want to jump out and tell everyone... but you cant. That's what keeps it individual. It is an unexaminable <a href="Quale">qualia</a> with a massive explanatory gap. It is like having and answer to one of those fundamental questions associated with <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> but not being able to tell anyone.

It’s individual. It's yours. 

It’s not obtainable in a whole system. But it is on a personal scale. Philosophy of one's self is, by right, individual. By some kind of combination of the <a href="Doomsday%20Argument">Doomsday Argument</a> and <a href="statistics">statistics</a>, it would not be unreasonable to believe that the best ideas must sit in a human being that has yet to tell the world. As <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> said: 

Religions and In-groups.
Whenever a new solution to the wonders of the universe arrives it gathers momentum and after thousands of years billions can end up believing one exact idea. e.g. <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> or <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>

This leads to the development of an in-group who all believe the same thing. Individual philosophy is that same process of discovery but in a personal way so that you can develop your own answers to the universes most difficult questions. In the same way that the <a href="Natural%20Philosophy">Natural Philosophers</a> strayed away from <a href="religion">religion</a> and <a href="Greek%20gods">Greek gods</a> for their answers, it must be necessary to cut a new wake through the expansive ocean of thought, rather than follow in others'. 
<a href="Alan%20Watts">Alan Watts</a> wrote in his book that he wished the English language would not get in the way of understanding. It is perhaps reasonable to believe that the religions that had the best preacher would survive the longest. Consider the historical prowess of <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>, <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> or <a href="Confucius">Confucius</a>; they were all public figures who could gather huge crowds and therefore followers.

Proof
<br>
Proof is a word that gets thrown around a lot. <a href="Godel%27s%20Theorem">Godel's Theorem</a> uses the statement "This statement is not provable" to show how something can be true but unproved. We get the same with having multiple religions and beliefs; they are all true but arguably unprovable for whatever reason (whether it is that God doesn't want to interfere with the laws of the universe or not).
<br>Since all is true, why should we not find our own path? 
Utopian Paradox.
We are in an economically beneficial system that just kinda works. That's why we have a <a href="Patriarchy">Patriarchy</a>. That's why so many people have so many bady things to say about the world that we label "<a href="society">society</a>". In natural selection nothing matters unless it somehow affects your ability to become more populous. So why should we live in a <a href="Utopia">Utopia</a>. What is necessary for this to happen is for the Utopian ideas to monopolise people – to take over the gene pools. It must spread like <a href="indoctrination">indoctrination</a> in an effort to create a better world. Utopia can’t exist because it creates people who take things for granted. "The harder the life, the finer the person" - Thesiger. How could a utopia be economically fee sable? "There can’t be rich without the poor". There can’t be the happy without the sad. There can’t be utopia without <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>. It is <a href="ying%20and%20yang">ying and yang</a>. Light and dark. They go hand in hand and we are left swirling in the middle ground, like the game of black and white.Of course the game is all about polarity. Two things are poles apart. Life and death. Young and old. But you can't have one without the other. If you take a bar magnet and chop off the south pole, why you are left with a new one where you did the chopping. If you took away the old then half the former young would suddenly be old. As passenger said "you only know the sun when it starts to snow"<br>This is one of the reasons why <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley's Island</a> fell apart.

Egoism.
<a href="Thinking">Thinking</a> is the most important part of individual philosophy.
<a href="Alan%20Watts">Alan Watts</a> was British philosophy who followed in the ways of the <a href="Vedanta">Vedanta Philosophy</a> or similar beliefs.<br> <a href="Andy%20Weir">Andy Weir</a> also wrote a short story called <a href="the%20egg">the egg</a>.

They both relate to the idea that we are all God. We are all playing hide and seek with our selves. We are hiding in lives that we call our own because we are the universe experiencing itself. We are hiding because it would be so marvellous when we wake up. That spirit that drifts between material bodies as in <a href="dualism">dualism</a> is God and therefore us. "Every time we hurt someone we are hurting ourselves" - Andy Weir. 

Obviously this idea of the ego being a hoax is fundamental to individual philosophy. In fact, it was Watts who put forward the idea that the ego is a hoax. 
The philosophy takes away the arguments over scientific proof in the same way that <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a> took away the supernatural by relying on one's own inner thoughts. This is called <a href="rationalism">rationalism</a>. These inner thoughts that make up our mantra need not be argued or discussed. There is no debate over who's is right and what is wrong. After all, we were put on this planet with no rules as such, but a society has created them for us. Fyodor Dostoevsky said This idea of our thoughts being linked to our soul is incompatible with the <a href="indoctrination">indoctrination</a> idea that all our thoughts come from our surroundings - as is the counter argument to the <a href="argument%20from%20morality">argument from morality</a>. Whether our morality comes from <a href="indoctrination">indoctrination</a>, <a href="God">God</a> or a single soul that you could call God anyway, it doesn't matter. The realisation of this freedom allows individual philosophists to create new branches of old ideas or old branches of new ideas. Individual philosophy is, at heart, the defiance of old ideas in the search for a more consistent model. This model can answer all questions and leave no <a href="God%20of%20the%20Gaps">God of the Gaps</a>. This model is individual to every person and might be <a href="subjective">subjective</a> or even <a href="cultural%20relativism">culturally objective</a>.

Joe Muto

Joe Muto, known as the "Fox Mole", is a former employee of <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a> known for his leaks of material from the company to <a href="Gawker">Gawker</a>.

Muto, a graduate of <a href="Notre%20Dame%20University">Notre Dame University</a>, started work at Fox as a production assistant in July 2004 and became an associate producer for "<a href="The%20O%27Reilly%20Factor">The O'Reilly Factor</a>", <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>'s show, in January 2007.

"The Fox News Mole".
In April 2012, Muto started a column on <a href="Gawker">Gawker</a>, "The Fox News Mole," in which he leaked gossip and unreleased footage from Fox News. According to Muto, he wanted to quit Fox News and work for Gawker, but Gawker staff instead proposed that he remain at Fox and leak material to them. To prove he worked at Fox News, Muto sent Gawker two Fox News outtakes: one was a discussion of horses by <a href="Sean%20Hannity">Sean Hannity</a> and <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a>, and another was <a href="Newt%20Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a> having his hair done by his wife. Gawker paid him $5,000 for the material. The outtakes were posted publicly.

According to Muto, he believed that only certain people in the New York City media industry would be interested in his column, but media attention spread nationally and to major news outlets. Fox News staff looked at the login information and found that Muto was the only person to recently access both videos. The company fired him.

Misdemeanor conviction and aftermath.
On May 9, Muto pleaded guilty to two <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charges: "attempted unlawful duplication of computer material" and "attempted criminal posession of computer material". He was sentenced to 200 hours of private community service, ten days of community service ordered by the court, and a fine of $1,000; he also gave up the $5,000 Gawker paid him to the court. Gawker paid for Muto's criminal defense.

As part of his community service Muto cleaned municipal parks, and for his private community service he chose to assist a <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> literacy organization. Muto stated that he had "did something very stupid and I suppose it's right that I paid for it." He stated that he would not have leaked the material if he knew he would be criminally prosecuted for it. Gawker editor-in-chief John Cook criticized the sentence, accusing <a href="Cyrus%20Vance%20Jr.">Cyrus Vance Jr.</a>, the <a href="district%20attorney">district attorney</a> of Manhattan, of trying to please <a href="Roger%20Ailes">Roger Ailes</a>.

1960s.
"Alakazam the Great" (1960).
"<a href="Alakazam%20the%20Great">Alakazam the Great</a>" (西遊記 Saiyu-ki, lit. "Journey to the West") is a 1960 Japanese anime film, based on the Chinese novel "<a href="Journey%20to%20the%20West">Journey to the West</a>", and was one of the earliest anime films to be released in the United States. Osamu Tezuka was named as a director of the film by Toei Company. However, Tezuka later stated that the only time he was in the studio was to pose for publicity photos. It was included in "<a href="The%20Fifty%20Worst%20Films%20of%20All%20Time">The Fifty Worst Films of All Time</a>", and is the only animated film featured in the book.

1990s.
A Troll in Central Park (1994).
<a href="A%20Troll%20in%20Central%20Park">A Troll in Central Park</a> (released in some countries as Stanley's Magic Garden) is a 1994 American animated musical fantasy-comedy film directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. It was released on October 7, 1994, by Warner Bros. Family Entertainment. The film grossed $71,368 at the North American box office.
A Troll in Central Park holds an approval rating of 17% based on six reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. TV Guide gave the movie two out of five stars and felt that the film's appeal was very age-limited, calling it "Pastel-pretty and cloyingly sweet," and that "A Troll in Central Park is strictly for the youngest members of the moviegoing audience." The A.V. Club wrote that A Troll in Central Park is "widely considered to be [Don Bluth's] worst film."

In the July 2001 issue of his magazine ToonTalk, Don Bluth said that "the development of a story is like the development of a child in a womb; it takes time and it must be done right and building A Troll in Central Park, taught us this lesson, the hard way."

2000s.
"Titanic: The Legend Goes On" (2000).
The American version of "" (<a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>: Titanic, mille e una storia or Titanic: La leggenda continua), a 2000 Italian animated feature film about the sinking of the RMS Titanic, written and directed by Camillo Teti. <a href="Linda%20Maria%20Koldau">Linda Maria Koldau</a>, author of The Titanic on Film: Myth versus Truth, described this version as being "a failed <a href="Disney">Disney</a> imitation that excels in bad taste." In 2011, <a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a> named it the 40th worst children's movie ever made, describing the film as being "widely considered one of the worst animated films ever made." Total Film later named Titanic: The Legend Goes On as the worst film ever made, after it topped a list of the 66 worst films ever in 2012. <a href="Screen%20Rant">Screen Rant</a> included it on a list of the twelve worst animated films of all time and it topped a cheatsheet.com list of the top ten worst animated films ever, with author Will Roberts commenting that "[any] list of the worst animated films of all time begins with ... Titanic: The Legend Goes On".

"Doogal" (2006).
"<a href="The%20Magic%20Roundabout%20%28film%29">The Magic Roundabout</a>" is a French-British movie, ranked by "<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>" as one of worst children's movie ever made. Its American version, "Doogal", was also critically panned: on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> it received an aggregate score of 8% based on 49 reviews (4 "fresh" and 45 "rotten"), with the consensus: "Overloaded with pop culture references, but lacking in compelling characters and plot, Doogal is too simple-minded even for the kiddies"; the website ranked it the 82nd worst reviewed movie of the 2000s. It has a score of 23 out of 100 ("generally unfavorable") on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, and an F rating from <a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a> writing that "very young children should be angry... where is it written that 4-year-olds don't deserve a good story, decent characters, and a modicum of coherence?". It was placed #5 on <a href="Ebert%20%26amp%3B%20Roeper">Ebert & Roeper</a>'s Worst of 2006. Michael Phillip of the <a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a> described the film as "Eighty-five minutes you'll never get back." Randy Miller of <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> says that: "Doogal is, after all, one of the worst excuses for a children's film during this or any year---and if you're really looking for an in-depth analysis of why it's so awful, you don't have to look hard. Filled to the brim with pop culture references and other such gags that'll be even less funny a few years from now, it's like Shrek without the occasional bit of charm and surprise". Frank Scheck of <a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a> wrote "The key frame animation, based on three-dimensional models, is rudimentary, with none of the characters proving visually arresting." Ned Martel of <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a> wrote "In Doogal setting the world right again involves a badly paced quest for three diamonds, assorted jokes that don't land, and a daringly incoherent climactic confrontation".

2010s.
"Foodfight!" (2012).
"<a href="Foodfight%21">Foodfight!</a>" is a 2012 American computer animated adventure comedy film produced by Threshold Entertainment and directed by Larry Kasanoff.

Club</a>" stated that "...the grotesque ugliness of the animation alone would be a deal-breaker even if the film weren't also glaringly inappropriate in its sexuality, nightmare-inducing in its animation, and filled with <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> overtones and iconography even more egregiously unfit for children than the script's wall-to-wall gauntlet of crude <a href="double%20entendre">double entendre</a>s and weird intimations of <a href="inter-species%20sex">inter-species sex</a>". "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V.

A "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" article condemned the film, saying: "The animation appears unfinished ... And the plot ... is impenetrable and even offensive." The article also reported that "Foodfight!" has been "seized upon by Internet purveyors of bad cinema". <a href="Indiewire">Indiewire</a> called it "one of the worst animated movies ever made". <a href="Screen%20Rant">Screen Rant</a> included "Foodfight!" on its list of the top twelve worst animated movies ever made, and <a href="Mental%20Floss">Mental Floss</a> and "<a href="Digital%20Trends">Digital Trends</a>" placed it in their respective top ten worst film lists. "Hollywood News" called it "by far the crappiest piece of crap I have ever had the misfortune to watch". Tim Brayton of "Antagony & Ecstasy" described it as "the absolute ugliest animated feature that has ever been released by something resembling an actual animation studio". Brayton concluded by stating: "This is, in all sincerity, one of the very worst movies I have ever seen".

Audiences polled by <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.
David Ehrlich of "<a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a>" gave the film a D, writing: "Make no mistake, "The Emoji Movie" is very, very, "very" bad (we're talking about a hyperactive piece of corporate propaganda in which <a href="Spotify">Spotify</a> saves the world and <a href="Patrick%20Stewart">Sir Patrick Stewart</a> voices a living turd), but real life is just too hard to compete with right now". <a href="Alonso%20Duralde">Alonso Duralde</a> of "<a href="TheWrap">TheWrap</a>" was also critical of the film, calling it "a soul-crushing disaster because it lacks humor, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but a complete waste of your time".
Glen Kenny of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described the film as "nakedly idiotic", stating that the film plays off a Hollywood idea that the "panderingly, trendily idiotic can be made to seem less so". <a href="Owen%20Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" lambasted the film as "hectic situational overkill" and "lazy" while viciously criticizing the film, writing: "There have been worse ideas, but in this case the execution isn't good enough to bring the notion of an emoji movie to funky, surprising life." Writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", Charles Bramesco called the film "insidious evil" and wrote that it was a little more than an exercise in <a href="advertising">advertising</a> smartphone downloads to children.

Callie Bonney Marble

Callie Bonney Marble was an American author and lyricist.

Early life.
Callie Bonney was born in <a href="Peoria%2C%20Illinois">Peoria, Illinois</a>, where her father, <a href="Charles%20C.%20Bonney">Charles C. Bonney</a>, was a young lawyer just beginning practice. He shortly afterward moved to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Illinois, and later became known as President of the World's Congresses at the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a> of 1893. In 1903 Bonney wrote "Charles Carroll Bonney. In Memoriam" for "<a href="Open%20Court%20Publishing%20Company">The Open Court</a>".

Bonney was of Anglo-Norman origin and descended from the noble De Bon family, who figured in the days of William the Conqueror. Afterward the spelling of the name became De Bonaye, and later Bonney. 

Bonney attended the best schools in Chicago, and afterward was graduated from the Chestnut Street Seminary for young ladies, then located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but later moved to Ogontz, Pennsylvania, cofounded in 1850 by <a href="Mary%20Bonney">Mary Bonney</a>. 

Career.
Callie Bonney Marble published two prose works, "Wit and Wisdom of Bulwer" and "Wisdom and Eloquence of Webster". 

Marble was a proficient French scholar and made translations of many of <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>'s shorter works. 

Marble's first writing for periodicals was a story, which was printed serially in a Chicago Masonic magazine. Since its appearance she wrote poems, sketches and stories for a great number of periodicals.

Marble did not begin to write until 1882, and much of her work had been done while in bed or on her lounge, due to her ill health. She accomplished a great deal, and gained a recognition that was general and gratifying. 

On October 29, 1898, <a href="Clara%20Shortridge%20Foltz">Clara Shortridge Foltz</a> announced the opening of her practice in Denver, Colorado, and began to publish a weekly magazine, "The Mecca" in honor of woman suffrage in the state of which Callie Bonney Marble was co-editor with her husband.

Liberian Federation of Trade Unions

The Liberian Federation of Trade Unions (abbreviated LFTU) was a <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> centre in <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>.

In 1977 the Liberian president <a href="William%20R.%20Tolbert%20Jr.">William R. Tolbert Jr.</a> had urged the different trade union centres to unite into a single body. Thus the Liberian Federation of Trade Unions (LFTU) was founded, uniting the <a href="Labor%20Congress%20of%20Liberia">Labor Congress of Liberia</a> and the <a href="Congress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations%20of%20Liberia">Congress of Industrial Organizations of Liberia</a>. Nevertheless the <a href="United%20Workers%20Congress%20of%20Liberia">United Workers Congress of Liberia</a> and the United Mine Workers Union refused to join LFTU.

The LFTU president was A. Benedict Tolbert, son of president Tolbert. Amos Gray served as the secretary general of LFTU. 

LFTU was a member of the <a href="International%20Confederation%20of%20Free%20Trade%20Unions">International Confederation of Free Trade Unions</a>. LFTU was given ICFTU membership at the 70th Executive Board meeting of ICFTU, held in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in May 1978. ICFTU was represented at the inauguration ceremony of LFTU on October 12, 1977. ICFTU sponsored a number of organizational trainings for LFTU.

As of January 1979 ICFTU estimated the LFTU membership at 10,000.

In August 1979 LFTU and UWC signed an agreement to work towards a merger and draft a joint constitution. The two centres were due to merge before the end of 1979, but merger talks were delayed after the death of mother and niece of the LFTU secretary-general Gray. In 1980 LFTU and UWC merged, forming the <a href="Liberian%20Federation%20of%20Labor%20Unions">Liberian Federation of Labor Unions</a> (LFLU). The ICFTU membership of LFTU was passed on to LFLU.

Golden Canopy of the Temple of the Tooth

Golden Canopy of the Temple of the Tooth is a <a href="canopy%20%28building%29">canopy</a> used to cover the <a href="Relic%20of%20the%20tooth%20of%20the%20Buddha">Relic of the tooth of the Buddha</a>, housed in the <a href="Temple%20of%20the%20Tooth">Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth)</a> in <a href="Kandy">Kandy</a> <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. 

In 1986 the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Sri%20Lanka">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Ranasinghe%20Premadasa">Ranasinghe Premadasa</a> made an official visit to the temple to pay homage to the sacred tooth relic. During this visit the chief monks complained about water leaking from the roof and Premadasa pledged to cover the roof with a bronze sheet.Six months later Premadasa formally announced plans to build a golden canopy over the inner shrine room of the temple. There were a number of objectors to the proposal including the Director of the <a href="Department%20of%20Archaeology%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29">Sri Lankan Department of Archeology</a>, Roland Silva, arguing that a canopy over the existing roof would risk the structural integrity of the building and the temple's heritage value, given that there had been no additions made to the building since the last <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kandy">King of Kandy</a>, <a href="Sri%20Vikrama%20Rajasinha%20of%20Kandy">Sri Vikrama Rajasinha</a>, had occupied the throne. On 31 December 1987 the golden canopy, which cost more than <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20rupee">Rs</a> 20M, was officially unveiled by Premadasa. The gold plated tiles on the canopy were imported from Japan and installed upon a steel frame. As the use of concrete was not practical due to the limited timeframe for construction a steel frame was erected however this resulted in the canopy being subject to swaying so further steel supports were installed, projecting from the upper level of the Dalada Museum, directly behind the Palle Mahala (Tevava Chamber).

Political commentators at the time attribute Premadasa's decision to erected the golden canopy as being a significant factor in his subsequent election to the country's <a href="President%20of%20Sri%20Lanka">presidency</a> in January 1988. The canopy over the country's most sacred relic symbolising and reinforcing the public view of his commitment that the country should remain a Sinhalese Buddhist nation.

In 2002 the canopy sheets were refurbished using 4,000 gold plated ceramic tiles produced in Sri Lanka.
In 2017 <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Sri%20Lanka">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Ranil%20Wickramasinghe">Ranil Wickramasinghe</a> publicly promised that the canopy will be renovated.

The piece is dedicated to Sacher.

Composition.
In the score's programme note, Lutosławski wrote that the prospect of work with the Heinz and Ursula Holliger was "a great inspiration" while working on the concerto. He added, "The music is multi-faceted and just when it seems to be saying one thing, it is saying something else at the same time – sometimes in contradiction. The titles of the movements [...] are only to be taken figuratively." The work is scored for solo <a href="oboe">oboe</a> and <a href="Pedal%20harp">harp</a> and a reduced <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a> consisting of only two <a href="Percussion%20instrument">percussionists</a> and <a href="String%20section">strings</a>.

Oh, Women!</a>". In the 1960s he moved to the small screen, where he did the bulk of his work over the next two decades, beginning as the director of photography (DP) for the final three seasons (1967-1969) of the television melodrama, "<a href="Peyton%20Place%20%28TV%20series%29">Peyton Place</a>".

Early life.
Cronjager was born on March 28, 1930 in Queens, New York. He came from a long line of famous cinematographers: His father was <a href="Henry%20Cronjager%2C%20Jr">Henry Cronjager, Jr</a>, who like his son worked primarily in the television industry; his uncle was the 7-time Oscar-nominated <a href="Edward%20Cronjager">Edward Cronjager</a>; his great-uncle was <a href="Jules%20Cronjager">Jules Cronjager</a>, who was the cinematographer on over 100 films from the mid-1910s through the early 1930s; and his grandfather was <a href="Henry%20Cronjager">Henry Cronjager</a>, a pioneering cinematographer who was known for his use of shadows, which would become a staple of the later German expressionist film movement.

Career.
Cronjager began working in film in the late 1950s. Working as an assistant cameraman or 2nd assistant cameraman, he began on the 1957 comedy, "<a href="Oh%2C%20Men%21%20Oh%2C%20Women%21">Oh, Men! Oh, Women!</a>". He also worked on the notable films, "<a href="South%20Pacific">South Pacific</a>" (1958), "<a href="The%20Hustler">The Hustler</a>" (1961), and "<a href="Rio%20Conchos">Rio Conchos</a>" (1964). Beginning with taking over the photography on "<a href="Peyton%20Place%20%28TV%20series%29">Peyton Place</a>" in 1967, he would work consistently in television through his retirement in 1988. Following "Peyton Place", he would move to "<a href="Bracken%27s%20World">Bracken's World</a>" in 1969, staying with that series until it ended in 1970. 

During the 1970s and 1980s, Cronjager was the original director of photography on the television series "<a href="Columbo">Columbo</a>" and "<a href="Hart%20to%20Hart">Hart to Hart</a>". He also continued to work on the big screen during this decade. In 1974 he was the cinematographer on the Charles Martin low-budget comedy, "<a href="How%20to%20Seduce%20a%20Woman">How to Seduce a Woman</a>".

In 1980, Cronjager was selected as the director of photography for the new police drama, "Hill Street Blues". For the initial episode, titled "Hill Street Station", Cronjager chose to shoot approximately 90% of the show utilizing hand-held cameras. His work garnered him a <a href="33rd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">Primetime Emmy</a>, for Outstanding Cinematography in a Series.

Even though Cronjager had no involvement in the original "<a href="Cannon%20%28TV%20series%29">Cannon</a>" television series from 1971-76, when the series was resurrected in 1980 as a television film, the film's director, Corey Alien, selected Cronjager to shoot the picture. The TV film was titled "<a href="List%20of%20Cannon%20episodes%23TV-movie">The Return of Frank Cannon</a>", and Alien was impressed with Cronjager's work on "Hill Street Blues". For one scene in the film, it was necessary to light a six-acre set for a nighttime shoot. It took Cronjager and his crew seven and a half hours setting up the scene's lighting, which took up 6000 feet of cable and used about 3,000 amps. In the final product, the scene took up approximately 5 seconds of air time.

Cronjager's last project was the 1988 television film, "<a href="Broken%20Angel%20%28tv%20film%29">Broken Angel (tv film)</a>", starring <a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a> and <a href="Susan%20Blakely">Susan Blakely</a>.

The monument's inscription for the Confederate mother statute reads: "O Great Confederate Mothers, we would print your names on monuments, that men may read them as the years go by and tribute pay to you, who bore and nurtured hero sons and gave them solace on that darkest hour, when they came home with broken swords and guns". The inscription for the Confederate soldier reads, "To our loyal Confederates". The soldier faces north.

The chapter of the <a href="United%20Daughters%20of%20the%20Confederacy">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a> that built the Confederate Mothers Monument was disbanded and a new chapter does not own the monument so the city is responsible for maintenance.

<doc id="54881282" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54881282" title="Old Jewish Cemetery, Bacău">
Old Jewish Cemetery, Bacău

The Old Jewish Cemetery in <a href="Bac%C4%83u">Bacău</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a> is a closed cemetery that was used by the jewish community of the city from at least the early 18th century until 1917, when the <a href="New%20Jewish%20Cemetery%2C%20Bac%C4%83u">New Jewish Cemetery</a> was opened. The cemetery is located in the center of Bacau, bordered by Pictor Theodor Aman Street from the north and Ghioceilor street in the east, just a few meters from the Athletics Hall, the Bacovia University and the Zimbru neighborhood.

History.
According to the spokesman of Bacau City Hall "the land does not belong to the municipality". Other (unofficial) sources from the City Hall even stated that the land does not even belong to the Romanian state.

The former president of the jewish community, Hari Vigdar, said that "we too do not know much about this cemetery. It was closed at the beginning of the twentieth century and is listed in our records as being repaired. We do not have any money to restore, we only have someone to look after and protect the place. We have not heard that a member living in our community has relatives buried there. The monuments are very difficult to read, they have deteriorated, and the writing is in Old Hebrew. 

Iacob Psantir, researcher of Jewish history in Romania published a book in 1871 in which he described the cemetery: "In this cemetery there are many other tomb stones which cannot be read, since for some the letters are erased by time, while others are buried so deep that I could not dig them up to read. However, the one that I did find and could read has marvellous and legible letters, but somehow was never mentioned in any registry”. 

The oldest tombstone found in the cemetery belongs to a person called "Aaron, the son of Yossef". He died in 1703. The researcher I. Kara researched the cemetery in 1936 and 1946 and found the tombstone mentioned by Mr.Psantir. He copied the inscription from the stone and published an essay claiming that this stone dated 1703 couldn't be the oldest one in the city, but does show that beginning of the 18th century there existed a Jewish population of numerical significance. The inscription from this tombstone reads: "This important man, honourable Aharon, son of departed Yosef, died on the 29th of Ijar, buried on the 15th Sivan year 5464". 

It is still a mystery why so many days had passed between the death and the burial of Aharon, knowing that in the Jewish tradition it is disrespectful for the dead to wait that long before burying him. After careful consideration, Mr.Kara decided that he had to have died somewhere where there wasn't a Jewish cemetery, and he was buried there temporarily, but later exhumed and transported to Bacau for his final resting-place 

After World War II it was transferred to the Jewish History Museum in Romania in Bucharest. 

Here were also buried former participants in the War of Independence of 1877 and the War of Enemy of the country. In 1912 the cemetery became full and the last burial took place in 1917 when the new cemetery was opened. 

Urban legands.
Until the 70s people were looking for gold, believing that the wealthy jews were buried with everything. Gold has never been found, but children playing around have found swords from the Independence War. It was also said that over some of the graves there is night flames, sign that there are hidden treasures from the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Also, according to other rumors, the cemetery had monuments from Vienna and Paris, some of which were made by the artist <a href="Rodin%20himself">Rodin himself</a>.

Day tours/stages.
First stage: Gengenbach – Nordrach (Moosmatt).
Route description.
The departure point is the upper gatge of Gengenbach. The path merges for about a kilometre with the <a href="Ortenau%20Wine%20Path">Ortenau Wine Path</a> running uphill through the village. After the first ascent the trail runs for several kilometres along the ridge (often on footpaths) and then climbs again steeply to the saddle between Mooskopf and Siedigkopf. The viewing tower on the Mooskopf (c. 200 metres from the path) offers a panoramic view; on the Siedigkopf a <a href="Lothar%20%28hurricane%29">monument to Hurricane Lothar</a> was built from three <a href="silver%20fir">silver fir</a> logs (c. 400 metres off the route). Immediately by the path is a <a href="Hans%20Jakob%20Christoffel%20von%20Grimmelshausen">monument to Grimmelshausen</a>. The path runs from here mainly on forest tracks initially steeply uphill and, before the final descent, leads into the Nordrach valley to the (unmanaged) hiking hostel of Sonnenhaus. Near Moosmatt it reaches the Nordrach. Here there is a restored charcoal burning pile (Kohlenmeiler), which had been working until 1945.


Second stage: Nordrach (Moosmatt) – Schapbach.
Route description.
The ascent out of the Nordrach valley climbs steeply to the Rautsch Hut on a footpath. From there the route continues to climb up a forest track and reaches the Heidenkirche <a href="blockfield">blockfield</a> via the Rosbedunnen Saddle. After a short descent the path runs along the slope to the Löcherbergwasen between <a href="Harmersbach">Harmersbach</a> and the <a href="Rench">Rench</a> valley. From here the route runs almost on the level along the ridge above the Zuwalder valley and reaches the Westweg on the Littweger Heights. Passing the Hansjakobstein the path runs gently downhill, later more steeply into the valley of the <a href="Wolf%20%28river%29">Wolf</a>, which it reaches just before Schapbach.


Third stage: Schapbach – Alpirsbach.
Route description.
The route leaves the Wolf valley on a steep ascent, reaching the saddle called “Das Tor” along a forest track . From her to the Emil Hut (‘’Emilshütte’’) via the Bocksecken it merges with the <a href="Mittelweg">Mittelweg</a> along a footpath. The descent follows a forest track into the valley of the Little Kinzig and past the former abbey of Wittichen. In Vortal it crosses the Little Kinzig. The ascent from here to the Sattellege is very steep. On the last few kilometres the prath runs above the Kinzig to Alpirsbach.

Phyllophora antarctica

Phyllophora antarctica is a <a href="species">species</a> of red alga in the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Phyllophoraceae">Phyllophoraceae</a>. It is native to Antarctica where it grows in dim light on the underside of <a href="sea%20ice">sea ice</a>. Some of it becomes detached and accumulates in drifts on the seabed. Many different organisms live attached to the fronds or among them.

Distribution.
"P. antarctica" is native to Antarctica. It is known from the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a>, <a href="McMurdo%20Sound">McMurdo Sound</a>, the <a href="Ross%20Sea">Ross Sea</a>, <a href="South%20Georgia%20Island">South Georgia</a>, <a href="Victoria%20Land">Victoria Land</a> and various subarctic islands. The <a href="Type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a> is <a href="Coulman%20Island">Coulman Island</a> near <a href="Cape%20Wadworth">Cape Wadworth</a> in the Ross Sea.

Biology.
In addition to <a href="chlorophyll%20a">chlorophyll a</a>, "P. antarctica" has other <a href="Photoreceptor%20protein">biliprotein</a> pigments, namely <a href="Phycoerythrin">R-phycoerythrin</a>, <a href="phycocyanin">phycocyanin</a> and <a href="allophycocyanin">allophycocyanin</a>. These pigments give the seaweed a greater ability to utilise blue light in the dim sub-ice environment. The phycoerythrin absorbs the blue light energy and then transfers it to the other biliproteins from where it is passed on to the <a href="photosynthetic%20reaction%20centre">photosynthetic reaction centre</a>, where it is turned into chemical energy.

Ecology.
"P. antarctica" reaches its greatest density in January. In some locations such as at <a href="Cape%20Evans">Cape Evans</a> on <a href="Ross%20Island">Ross Island</a>, "P. antarctica" is the main <a href="primary%20producer">primary producer</a> at depths between . Some of it is attached, but most is drifting and accumulates on the sea bed. At first, the detached fronds are in good condition and photosynthesis continues, but over time they degrade and are gradually broken up. These beds of decaying algae have a substantial effect on the communities living on and under the seabed. Although the alga contains <a href="secondary%20metabolite">secondary metabolite</a>s which make it distasteful to herbivores, research has shown that <a href="Polychaete">polychaete worms</a> and <a href="amphipod">amphipod</a>s consume it to some extent, and the beds of drifting seaweed may help provide continuity of food supply for them during the Antarctic winter.

"P. antarctica" provides a large surface area on which <a href="Epiphyte">epiphytic</a> organisms can grow and it has a rich and diverse fauna. In some circumstances, particularly when the <a href="Sterechinus%20neumayeri">Antarctic sea urchin</a> ("Sterechinus neumayeri") is restricting the algal growth, the <a href="biomass">biomass</a> of the epiphytes may exceed that of the algae. The species found attached or associated with the algae include the limpet "<a href="Iothia%20emarginuloides">Iothia emarginuloides</a>", the amphipod "<a href="Paramoera%20walkeri">Paramoera walkeri</a>", various polychaete worms and the Antarctic sea urchin. Other epiphytes include <a href="bryozoa">bryozoa</a>ns, <a href="Serpulidae">serpulid</a> worms and <a href="Hydrozoa">hydroids</a>, the latter being preyed on by the <a href="nudibranch">nudibranch</a> "<a href="Tenellia%20georgiana">Tenellia georgiana</a>".

Newhailes House

Newhailes House is a Palladian style country house which stands in 80 acres of parkland on the edge of the small town of <a href="Musselburgh">Musselburgh</a> in East Lothian, Scotland. Originally named Whitehills, it is a <a href="Category%20A%20listed">Category A listed</a> building which is now occupied and maintained by the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Trust">Scottish National Trust</a>. 

The current building comprises the original 7-bay frontage flanked by later extensions.

The stable block is also a Category A building. 

History.
The house was originally built c.1686 by Scottish architect <a href="James%20Smith%20%28architect%29">James Smith</a> for his own use. In 1701 he sold the estate to John Bellenden, 2nd Lord Bellenden, who sold it in 1709 to <a href="Sir%20David%20Dalrymple%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir David Dalrymple, 1st Baronet</a>. He renamed the house Newhailes in recognition of <a href="Hailes%20Castle">Hailes Castle</a> on their family estate at <a href="East%20Linton">East Linton</a> and added the east wing as a library. On his death in 1721 the house passed to his heir <a href="Sir%20James%20Dalrymple%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Sir James Dalrymple, 2nd Baronet</a>, the Principal <a href="Auditor%20of%20the%20Exchequer%20in%20Scotland">Auditor of the Exchequer in Scotland</a>. Sir James extended and reshaped the house, adding a balancing west apartment wing, and moving the entrance from the north-east to the south-west. The gardens were probably laid out at the same time.

LMK

"LMK" is a song by American singer and songwriter <a href="Kelela">Kelela</a> from her upcoming debut studio album "<a href="Take%20Me%20Apart">Take Me Apart</a>". It was released on August 1, 2017 through <a href="Warp%20%28record%20label%29">Warp Records</a> as the album's <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a>.

Background and release.
"LMK" premiered on <a href="Zane%20Lowe">Zane Lowe</a>'s <a href="Beats%201">Beats 1</a> show on August 1, 2017, and subsequently released for digital download and streaming. Kelela told "<a href="The%20Fader">The Fader</a>" that the song is "directed at a man who's being weird instead of being honest. Does casual have to be careless? Is wifey the only woman who deserves your respect, and why do you think I want more when I demand it? These are my questions..."

Composition.
"LMK" is an <a href="Electro%20%28music%29">electro</a>-<a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> track which revolves around "a wobbly, three-note synth-bass" with Kelela singing about a "potential <a href="one-night-stand">one-night-stand</a>." The bass-heavy and <a href="Industrial%20music">industrial</a> production was handled by <a href="Jam%20City">Jam City</a>. Briana Younger of "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" noted that Jam City's "pristine soundscape, while more minimal than what Kelela usually sings over, complements her well with its blend of space-age clubbiness and sultry R&B. It makes for what is probably her most pop-accessible song to date, an empowered and liberating song that asserts not just a woman's agency, but also Kelela's power as an artist."

Music video.
The music video for "LMK" was uploaded to Kelela's <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a> channel on August 9, 2017. Directed by longtime <a href="Bj%C3%B6rk">Björk</a> collaborator Andrew Thomas Huang, the video is "a surreal visual that sees Kelela moving through hazy, club-like environments with authority and a take-no-prisoners attitude." Regarding the video, Huang said: "We wanted make a video that showcases the multiplicity of who Kelela is and who she has the potential to be. The video is essentially a grand unveiling featuring Kelela wearing different wigs and guises as she pushes through the club with her friends, ultimately revealing herself at the end of the video. The message of this video is empowerment: it's for the girls, for anyone whose heart has been trampled on and deserves to go out and feel good about themselves. It's a call to action, demanding to be taken and to be quick about it. This is the reason why we love Kelela - she's making herself vulnerable and kicking down doors in the process."

E. Miriam Coyrière

E. Miriam Coyrière was a business woman, the founder in 1880 of the E. Miriam Coyriere Teachers' Agency in Manhattan.

Early life.
E. Miriam Coyrière was born in London, England, when her parents were traveling and visiting relatives there. She was of English ancestry, the Hopkins family on her father's side, who settled in New England and were prominent in the history of the Colonies, and on her mother's side the Archer family, at one time the owners of <a href="Fordham%2C_Bronx%23Old_Fordham_Village">Fordham Manor</a>, in <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County, New York</a>. Lord John Archer received the letters patent on the estate in November, 1671. He was a descendant of Fulbert L'Archer, one of the companions of William the Conquerer. The manor was mortgaged in 1686 to <a href="Cornelius%20Van%20Steenwyk">Cornelius Van Steenwyk</a>, a New York merchant, and he left it by will to the Dutch Church of New York. On her mother's side the families have been Episcopalians since the establishment of the Episcopal Church in England; on her father's side they have belonged to the same church for over one-hundred years.

Coyrière inherited literary talent from her mother, who was both poet and artist. Her father, who was wealthy at the time of his marriage, was a talented and highly educated man, and he turned his attainments to account when his fortune was swept away. He was a fine linguist and an author. Coyriere belonged to a family of six children. 

Career.
E. Miriam Coyrière was a member of the <a href="National%20Education%20Association">National Education Association</a>, of the Woman's Health Association and of other organizations. 

Aided by <a href="Peter%20Cooper">Peter Cooper</a>, Coyrière became a teacher, after a course of study in <a href="Cooper%20Union">Cooper Institute</a>. After teaching for a time, she learned the school furniture business. In 1880 she opened the "E. Miriam Coyriere Teachers' Agency" at 150 Fifth avenue, Manhattan, that earned a world-wide reputation. She worked diligently to build it up and succeeded. She supplied teachers for every grade of educational institution, from colleges down to district schools, and her patrons were in every State of the Union and in Canada, in Central America, Mexico and South America, and she supplied teachers for European institutions as well. 

In 1884 she displayed furniture and school apparatus at the International Congress in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she won a diploma. 

Personal life.
Coyrière's first marriage was unfortunate. Her husband failed, and her parents died and left three young sons to her and her sister's care. To add to her labor, her first husband became an invalid from paralysis. Her only son died in infancy. 

Coyriere's second husband was Professor Carlos Pardo, a writer on pedagogy, whom she married in 1884. Both were members of the American Association of Science, and Coyriere, who kept her business name, E. Miriam Coyriere, was interested in all the reform movements of the time. Their home was a center of intellectual activity.

<doc id="54881593" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54881593" title="United States v. Philip Morris">
United States v. Philip Morris

United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. was a case in which the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia">United States District Court for the District of Columbia</a> held several major tobacco companies liable for violations of the <a href="Racketeer%20Influenced%20and%20Corrupt%20Organizations%20Act">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) Act</a> by engaging in numerous acts of fraud to further a conspiracy to deceive the American public about nicotine addiction and the health effects of cigarettes and environmental tobacco smoke.

Judge <a href="Gladys%20Kessler">Gladys Kessler</a> found that the evidence overwhelmingly established that the companies violated RICO by coordinating their public relations, research, and marketing efforts in order to advance their scheme to defraud by denying the adverse health effects of smoking, denying the addictiveness of nicotine, denying their manipulation of the nicotine content of cigarettes, and denying that their marketing targeted youth as new smokers. The companies also suppressed and destroyed information related to the dangers of smoking in order to maximize their profits and enhance the market for cigarettes. 

Trial.
Complaint.
On September 22, 1999, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> brought a lawsuit against nine cigarette manufactures and two tobacco industry trade associations in the United States District Court of the District of Columbia (“District Court”). The complaint alleged that the tobacco companies had engaged in an approximately fifty-year conspiracy to fraudulently deceive the American public about the health effects of smoking and environmental tobacco smoke, the addictiveness of nicotine, the health benefits from low tar, “light” cigarettes, and their manipulation of the design and composition of cigarettes in order to sustain nicotine addiction. According to the complaint, the tobacco companies deliberately sought to deny that smoking caused disease and to maintain that there was no scientific consensus on the subject. In furtherance of this strategy, Defendants allegedly issued deceptive press releases, published false and misleading articles, destroyed and concealed documents which indicated that there was in fact a correlation between smoking and disease, and aggressively targeted children as potential new smokers. 

The lawsuit sought to recover health care expenditures the government had paid and would have to pay to treat tobacco-related illnesses as a result of the tobacco companies’ unlawful action under three federal statutes: the Medical Care Recovery Act (“MCRA), the Medicare Secondary Payer (“MSP”) provisions,  and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO").  Additionally, the government requested injunctive relief under the RICO Act to prevent the tobacco companies from engaging in further fraud and to disgorge the companies’ ill-gotten proceeds from their illegal activity. 

Proceedings.
Defendants moved to dismiss the case on all counts, and in September 2000, the District Court granted their motion in part, dismissing the MCRA and MSP claims and preventing the government from recovering tobacco-related health care expenditures. However, the court allowed the case to proceed on the RICO claims.
Under RICO, the Government sought injunctive relief and $289 billion in disgorgement of defendants’ ill-gotten gains from the alleged conspiracy. Defendants appealed the requested relief to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> (“DC Circuit”). On interlocutory appeal, the DC Circuit determined that disgorgement is not a permissible remedy in civil RICO cases because injunctive relief must be "forward looking" to prevent and restrain future violations.  

The Government continued to seek monetary damages to fund smoking cessation and prevention programs, and in 2005, the Department of Justice amended its requested relief for these programs from $130 billion over 25 years to $14 billion over ten years. At this time, several public health groups joined the lawsuit as intervenors for the purpose of asserting their interests in the proposed relief. 

Opinion of the court.
On August 17, 2006 Judge Gladys Kessler issued a landmark 1,683-page opinion holding the tobacco companies liable for conspiracy and violations of RICO by fraudulently covering up the health risks associated with cigarettes and for marketing their products to children. Kessler wrote that the tobacco companies “have marketed and sold their lethal product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted.”

Because the DC Circuit held that RICO permits only forward-looking remedies to prevent and restrain future violations, Judge Kessler ruled that the tobacco companies could not be made to fund the smoking cessation and awareness programs. The ruling ordered the following injunctive relief:   

Prohibition of Brand Descriptors.
The court found that the only way to restrain defendants from their longstanding and continuing fraudulent efforts to deceive smokers, potential smokers, and the American public about “light” and “low tar” cigarettes was to prohibit them from using any descriptor which conveys a health message. Accordingly, Judge Kessler enjoined defendants from using any descriptors indicating lower tar delivery -- including, but not limited to, “low tar,” “light,” “mild,” “medium” and “ultra-light” -- which create the false impression that such cigarettes are less harmful to smokers. 

Corrective Communications.
The trial record established that defendants had made false, deceptive, and misleading public statements about cigarettes, and the court found that an injunction ordering them to issue corrective statements is appropriate and necessary to prevent and restrain them from making fraudulent public statements on smoking and health matters in the future.

Judge Kessler ordered defendants to make corrective statements about: (1) addiction, (2) the adverse health effects of smoking), (3) the adverse health effects of exposure to second-hand smoke, (4) the manipulation of the cigarettes to enhance nicotine delivery, and (5) the health benefits of “light” and “low tar” cigarettes. Defendants were required to publish these statements in newspapers and disseminate them through television, advertisements, onsets, in retail displays, and on their corporate websites. 

Disclosure of Documents and Disaggregated Marketing Data.
The court determined that defendants’ suppression and concealment of information was integral to their efforts to defraud the American public, and that defendants had failed to disclose, and created false controversy over the existence of, information they possessed about cigarettes.  

Judge Kessler ordered that the tobacco companies must create and maintain document depositories and websites which provide the government and the public with access to all industry documents disclosed in the litigation. Additionally, defendants must provide their disaggregated marketing data to the government to ensure transparency of their marketing efforts, particularly those directed towards youth.

Outcome.
All parties appealed Judge Kessler’s 2006 decision to the DC Circuit. In 2009, a three-judge panel unanimously upheld Judge Kessler’s finding of liability and upheld most of the ordered remedies.  A subsequent appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court. 

Challenges to the Corrective Statements.
Judge Kessler ordered the tobacco companies to make corrective statements on five topics about which they had historically deceived and misled the public. The specific language of these statements was not included in the 2006 ruling, but the parties were to submit proposals for approval by the court. The tobacco companies appealed to the DC Circuit, challenging the corrective-disclosure remedy under both RICO and the First Amendment. 

The DC Circuit upheld the corrective statements as a valid remedy in 2009, finding that requiring defendants to reveal the previously hidden truth about their products will prevent and restrain them from disseminating false and misleading statements, thereby violating RICO, in the future. However, the statements must be confined to purely factual and uncontroversial information, intended to thwart efforts to either directly mislead consumers or capitalize on prior deceptions by continuing to advertise in a manner that builds on consumers’ existing misperceptions. The DC Circuit also vacated a requirement that the statements be published on retail displays, instructing the District Court to consider the third-party implications of this remedy on remand. 

In 2012, Judge Kessler released specific language for the five corrective statements based on proposals submitted by all parties after the 2009 DC Circuit ruling. The tobacco companies were ordered to make the corrective statements through television and newspaper advertising, on their websites, and on cigarette packaging. In a series of subsequent appeals, defendants challenged the language proposed by the court, claiming that portions of the selected text violated their First Amendment rights and were intended to humiliate them and disclose prior wrongdoing rather than prevent and restrain future RICO violations. These appeals resulted in modifications to the language of proposed statements.

The language of the corrective statements was not finalized until June 2017.  Still at issue is whether the court can order the corrective statements be posted at retail establishments – or the “point-of-sale” (“POS”) – for tobacco products.

Hanging Gardens (Classixx album)

Hanging Gardens is the debut studio album by <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>-based <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> production duo <a href="Classixx">Classixx</a>, consisting of Michael David and Tyler Blake. The duo had been making tracks since 2007 but did not decide to release a full-length album until much later because of their concerns over listeners really wanted an LP from them. In making the record, Classixx went for a record with "hooky melod[ies]," "some nice chords," and a positive feel-good tone while still having depth not common in dance music. "Hanging Garden" is an <a href="electropop">electropop</a> album that contains elements of a wide variety of genres such as French dance music, rock, <a href="Chicago%20house">Chicago house</a>, <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>, <a href="techno">techno</a>, and <a href="balearic%20beat">balearic beat</a>. The LP features collaborations from acts such as <a href="Nancy%20Whang">Nancy Whang</a>, <a href="Active%20Child">Active Child</a>, Sarah Chernoff, <a href="Jeppe%20Laursen">Jeppe</a>, and Jesse Kivel.

Promoted with single releases for "I'll Get You," "Holding On," and "All You're Waiting For" and music videos for the songs "Holding On," "All You're Waiting For," and "Stranger Love," "Hanging Gardens" was distributed by <a href="Innovative%20Leisure">Innovative Leisure</a> and <a href="Future%20Classic">Future Classic</a> on May 14, 2013. Responses from professional <a href="music%20journalist">reviewers</a> were favorable in general and ranked in the top 50 of numerous year-end lists by publications such as "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", "<a href="Gigwise">Gigwise</a>", and "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"; some critics called it superior from most other dance albums due to its songwriting, while some were more critical of the LP's instrumental tracks and repetitiveness. "<a href="Thump%20%28Vice%29">Thump</a>" has ranked it the 84th best dance album ever released. The LP also did well commercially, landing in the top 15 on the American "Billboard" <a href="Independent%20Albums">Independent Albums</a> and <a href="Heatseekers%20Albums">Heatseekers Albums</a> charts.

Background.
Classixx had been working on songs since 2007. For a while, they were very skeptical about making a studio album. As Michael David explained, "we struggled for a little bit as to whether or not people care[d] for a full-length album, especially from two producers." "I'll Get You," a track that would later appear on "Hanging Gardens", was released as a single on October 5, 2009; its music video for the song was done by American photographer Mark Hunter, also known as Cobrasnake, which involves a female in a bikini dancing to the track on a beach. It was until they had produced a certain amount of tracks that the duo "felt like [they] were on to something decent" and decided to create an album. 

Production.
"Hanging Gardens" was mainly recorded in Classixx's studio on Santa Clara Avenue in <a href="Venice%20Beach">Venice Beach</a>. The duo wanted all of the tracks to be "symbolic representation[s]" of their life in Venice Beach. For instance, the title of "Rhythm Santa Clara’ represents the location of their Santa Clara studio. When the duo formed, they originally only used <a href="software%20synthesizer">software synthesizer</a>s like <a href="NI%20Massive">NI Massive</a>, but later on, they began using outboard equipment; thus, most of the tracks on "Hanging Gardens" includes many sounds that were produced with <a href="analog%20synthesizers">analog synthesizers</a>. The album's closer "Borderline," was originally planned to have an actual drumbeat, but the duo chose to only have claps for percussion to give the track an "unsettling" effect.

"Hanging Gardens" includes collaborations with artists such as <a href="Nancy%20Whang">Nancy Whang</a>, <a href="Active%20Child">Active Child</a>, Sarah Chernoff, <a href="Jeppe%20Laursen">Jeppe</a>, and Jesse Kivel. However, Classixx intended to create collaborations for the LP at least as possible, Blake reasoning that “when you make a record represented by the collaborations, you get lost in your sound." They also didn't want to use acts that were very popular but rather actual friends to work with because, as David explained, "when you have these albums with like, big names to help propel the record, it can feel really disjointed and you don’t get great work because they’re doing you a favor." Whang's vocals were tracked at a <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> studio run by Nick Millhiser of the band <a href="Holy%20Ghost%21">Holy Ghost!</a>.

The title of "Hanging Garden" was conceived by the duo from looking at a picture of a futuristic building by <a href="Renzo%20Piano">Renzo Piano</a> in the middle of the rainforest. The artwork was done by Australian designer Jonathan Zawada. With the cover art, the duo intended a symbol that was similar to the logo for the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>. However, Alejandra Ramirez of "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" described it as a homage to the cover of <a href="Tangerine%20Dream">Tangerine Dream</a>'s record "<a href="Optical%20Race">Optical Race</a>" (1988).

Composition.
"Hanging Gardens" is an 1980s-style <a href="electropop">electropop</a> album that touches on many types of musical genres and synthesizer textures. It uses melodies in the vein of <a href="classic%20rock">classic rock</a>, and <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> journalist Tim Sendra categorized "Hanging Gardens" as a combination of "uptempo neo-disco tracks with moody, late-night ballads, and sunny tropical jams with a driving-through-rain-soaked-city-streets vibe." Freelance writer Jordan Manizer labeled “A Fax from the Beach” a "pseudo-<a href="ambient%20music">ambient</a>" track, <a href="Contactmusic.com">Contactmusic.com</a> described "Rhythm Santa Clara" as a <a href="techno">techno</a> cut, while "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Larry Fitzmaurice categorized "Long Lost" as an "ethereal <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>-leaning tune." The album also includes elements of <a href="Chicago%20house">Chicago house</a>, <a href="balearic%20beat">balearic beat</a>, <a href="trance%20music">trance</a>, <a href="electro-funk">electro-funk</a>, what Paul Lester of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" described as the "chilldisco" works of <a href="Active%20Child">Active Child</a> and <a href="Toro%20y%20Moi">Toro y Moi</a>, and music by <a href="New%20Order%20%28band%29">New Order</a>.

Classixx was influenced by French music acts such as <a href="Fred%20Falke">Fred Falke</a> and <a href="Daft%20Punk">Daft Punk</a>; "Holding On" includes synthesizer similar to those in Falke's track "808 PM at the Beach," while "All You're Waiting For" is reminiscent of tracks from Daft Punk's LP "<a href="Discovery%20%28Daft%20Punk%20album%29">Discovery</a>" (2001). David reasoned that "French dance music artists modernized music genres like <a href="Boogie%20%28genre%29">boogi</a> funk and <a href="italo%20disco">italo disco</a> and churned repetitive synth beats into danceable pop-structured songs." A journalist for "<a href="NPR%20Music">NPR Music</a>" categorized "Hanging Gardens" as "<a href="French%20house">French house</a> through a smooth <a href="Yacht%20Rock">Yacht Rock</a> lens." Other and influences and inspirations for the album's sound include <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="Quincy%20Jones">Quincy Jones</a>, <a href="Giorgio%20Moroder">Giorgio Moroder</a>, <a href="Death%20from%20Above%20%28band%29">Death from Above</a>, <a href="Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>, and the <a href="Talking%20Heads">Talking Heads</a>.

With "Hanging Gardens", Classixx went for an LP that had depth, therefore not being "a dance record from beginning to end," but also still had a "fun[] dance groove." They were very focused on making a <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> album with "hooky melod[ies]," "some nice chords," and a positive feel-good tone. All of the tracks consist of what Ramirez labeled as "glossy synths and glassy-eyed club gestures" and range in style from mainstream accessible dance music cuts like 'Holding On" to <a href="deep%20house">deep house</a> songs such as "Rhythm Santa Clara." Lester analyzed the LP "has a sort of nostalgic-for-now quality of ebullient sadness that works well as a soundtrack for late summer." As Kirk Williams analyzed, "Hanging Gardens" is a <a href="melodic">melodic</a> album that, in addition to synthesizers, also uses live instruments "for optimal emotional impact." Ramirez noted that the LP has a "push-and-pull" method of balancing its "kitschiness and tasteful" elements; he used “Do You Like Bass" as a specimen for this, where the vocal line “Do you like bass" is "absurdly repeated to kitschy excess, but coupled with gilded bass thumps, and sunny warbles, the song works."

Promotion.

Critical reception.
Responses from <a href="music%20journalist">music journalist</a>s towards "Hanging Gardens" upon release were very favorable in general. In a review for "<a href="SpinMedia">Death and Taxes</a>", Ned Hepburn stated, ""Hanging Gardens" is a beautiful, memorable album that will go down as one of the albums of the year. It’s classy and classic at the same time; a rare combo." Sendra honored "Hanging Gardens" as a "crash course on electronic pop in 2013," writing that "so many dance music producers rely on the beats and some dynamics to put their music across, but Classixx stand apart from the pack by writing songs with melodies that stick with you." Mainzer wrote that it showed that Classixx are "certainly capable of transcending its own genre to create something truly interdisciplinary." 

Fitzmaurice called the album a "decadent trifle to lose yourself in, a deceptively simple record that has the potential for great longevity." He opined that "the biggest surprise of "Hanging Gardens" is that they're great songwriters, too" and "it's astonishing how many of the guest appearances simply work, and in such a satisfying way, too." Critic Gerrit Feenstra honored the record as "an indelible blend of old and new – retro without rust, progressive without distancing, and hopefulness and passion without cheese." He also noted, "Classixx have a unique vision to offer the dance floor through their vast, hopeful sound that keeps the energy building while giving the listener something more euphoric to experience."

However, "Hanging Gardens" also garnered a fair share of criticism. Both Fitzmaurice and Lester were the least favorable towards "Hanging Gardens"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s instrumentals. Lester opined that the songs with vocals were the album's better tracks, reasoning that they "engage" the listener in terms of emotion, while Fitzmaurice explained that the instrumental tracks "aren't quite distinctive enough to push the five-and-six-minute mark as they frequently do." "The Digital Fix" called the album a "winning cocktail of contagious, party-inducing dance and more chilled, melodic tunes will prove to be a hot weather soundtrack for many." However, they were also mixed towards the songs in the middle part of the record; they stated that since there were "few vocal samples or variation to add interest, these tracks simply fall short of the mark, and allow a dull repetition to set in." 

In a piece for "In Your Speakers", Lindsay Saunders also criticized the repetitive nature of the LP and summarized that, despite having a few "shining moments," "the music fits the album art because it sounds like something you would work out to, but not a particularly enjoyable record in and of itself." In a review for "Ion" magazine, writer Trevor Risk was very harsh towards "Hanging Gardens", calling it "completely bland, with maybe enough good musical ideas to fill one track at best." His review also lambasted that labels "enlist electronic acts to pump out LPs either to fulfill contracts, or to try and legitimize themselves in the world of “pop” and claim that they’ve all moved on from doing remixes, as if that’s below them at this point."

Accolades.
"Hanging Gardens" was in the top 50 of numerous year-end lists. It was number 37 on a year-end list of best albums by independent music blog "Obscure Sound", where Mike Mineo called it the "life of the party," "vibrant and brimming with color," and wrote that it "shows some of the most engaging sounds and production in the electronica scene today." Putting the LP at number 17 on their "50 best albums of 2013," "<a href="Gigwise">Gigwise</a>" stated that it "is the embodiment of summer, a tracklist that screams sunshine through its bouncy electronic grooves and excellent production." 

"Hanging Gardens" was also number 17 on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of 2013's best dance albums. They highlighted its "relaxed confidence that belongs at a daytime party in any city," and also noted, "It’s one thing to produce an album that embodies a sound, but the L.A. duo has also left enough space on “Hanging Gardens” to inspire a scene." "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" put it on their list of the best dance albums of the year at number 20, while on a list of the best albums of 2013 by "<a href="Gorilla%20vs.%20Bear">Gorilla vs. Bear</a>", the LP ranked number 28. On "<a href="Thump%20%28Vice%29">Thump</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s list of the "99 Greatest Dance Albums of All Time," "Hanging Gardens" was number 84, with the publication describing it as "12 tracks of happy-go-lucky perfection. If you soundtracked the best first date in history, you'd get this. Swipe right forever."

Port Hill drill hall, Hertford

The Port Hill drill hall was a military installation in <a href="Hertford">Hertford</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>.

History.
The building was designed as the headquarters of the 1st (Hertfordshire) Volunteer Battalion, The <a href="Bedfordshire%20Regiment">Bedfordshire Regiment</a> and was completed at a cost of £2,000 in 1898. This unit evolved to become the Hertfordshire Battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment in 1908 and then the 1st Battalion, The <a href="Hertfordshire%20Regiment">Hertfordshire Regiment</a> in 1909.

The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. Approximately 100,000 rounds of ammunition were stored in the drill hall at that time ready for issue to soldiers who were about to see action in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>.

The battalion was still located at the drill hall when it was mobilised for service in the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>.

The battalion was absorbed into the <a href="3rd%20East%20Anglian%20Regiment">3rd East Anglian Regiment</a> in 1958. However the British Army continued to maintain a presence at Port Hill drill hall, for the training of both Territorial Army personnel and of cadets. Nevertheless the drill hall eventually became surplus to requirements: it was decommissioned and subsequently demolished and, in 2003, a new residential development, which won the 2004/2005 Civic Design Award, was created in its place.
