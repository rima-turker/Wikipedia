Chakresh Kumar

Chakresh Kumar (28 April 1984) is an Indian theatre director and actor. Born in Etawah in a farmer family to an army man. He began his theatre career during the school life. Chakresh Kumar has won numerous awards in his career, including Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar by <a href="Sangeet%20Natak%20Akademi">Sangeet Natak Akademi</a>, <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a> in stagecraft and Young Progressive Director of Punjab.

Biography.
Chakresh was born in a humble family to an army-man. He is the eldest of three siblings. He did graduation with Bachelors of Arts from <a href="Panjab%20University%2C%20Chandigarh">Panjab University, Chandigarh</a>. It was during this time that he established the theatre group Alankar to serve and aware the society. In order to support his college fees and theatre expenses, he shuffled between jobs like taxi service and several BPOs. He completed Masters in Theatre from <a href="Panjab%20University%2C%20Chandigarh">Panjab University, Chandigarh</a> (Department of Indian Theatre ). In the final year of his post graduation he directed a play Macbeth, which became so popular that it was shown in seven different states on regional television channels. Moving forward he served as a faculty in ITFT College. During this period he left his job and began serving as a director and acting trainer in his theatre group.

Ideology.
Chakresh’s approach to work is entirely actor-oriented. He goes to the extent of saying that the theatrical elements such as lighting, make-up, costumes should only serve to enhance the connection between the actor and the audience. He believes the engagement between the actor and the audiences’ to be the ultimate truth and all the aforementioned technicalities as only serving as a catalyst in it.

In his early years of acting, Kumar studied the theories of Antonin Artaud, Bertolt Brecht, Jerzy Grotowsky and acknowledges their influence in his work. Combining the years of studying of the renowned theorists and his own experience in the field, Chakresh is evolving his own method which has a lot to do with an actor’s SELF, a person’s essential being.

Regarding direction, he strongly emphasizes that a director must leave the ‘director’s chair’ or the confinements of his/her own luxury. In order to achieve the truth of the situation being portrayed, the director needs to be one with the actor(s). He does not believe that an actor is subordinate to the director or as some would believe- a puppet in the hand of the latter. Whereas he feels that it is the director who is the reflection of an actor’s work and Kumar invests immensely in the actor. In his process, he observes the actor and spends time and energy knowing the person that the actor is. He then fabricates exercises, methods that are tailor-made for the artist and work best for finally being able to enact the character to the minutest of detail.

He treats the subject he is dealing with utmost importance and believes in talking about and bringing to fore the lesser-known or neglected part of our society. He expresses his surprise on how even love has become a taboo in our lives. His work has been primarily about empowering the despised such as daily wagers, laborers and transgenders’ whom he believes are all an indispensable and equal part of our society. In his own words, ‘God forbids if one day all (the neglected ones) join forces, owing to the increasing insensitivity towards them, the modern day society would be bound to suffer…’

He is known to be collaborating with actors ageing from 8-80 and thoroughly enjoys the same. He says- “the zeal with which one takes up a task, in this context, the passion with which a person ventures into acting (or the purpose of one’s life) should remain intact and withstand the storms of time and eventual disappointments to come. That zeal must always grow stronger with time and it, combined with the inner liveliness or in other words, the childishness of that person, does achieve miracles”

Theatre Plays.
Chakresh has directed and acted in many plays under his own production Alankar Theatre .

Daniel H. Coakley

Daniel Henry Coakley (December 10, 1865 – September 18, 1952) was an American political figure and lawyer. As an attorney, he took part in numerous <a href="badger%20game">badger game</a> extortion schemes. He was disbarred in 1922 for deceit, malpractice, and gross misconduct. He later was elected to the <a href="Massachusetts%20Governor%27s%20Council">Massachusetts Governor's Council</a>, where he secured a pardon for mobster <a href="Raymond%20L.%20S.%20Patriarca">Raymond L. S. Patriarca</a>. He was impeached in 1941 for using his position and influence to secure pardons in exchange for financial gain.

Early life.
Coakley was born on December 10, 1865 in <a href="South%20Boston">South Boston</a>. He attended <a href="Boston%20College">Boston College</a>, but did not graduate due to illness. Once he recovered he went to work for his father as a <a href="teamster">teamster</a>. He left this job to work as a conductor for the Cambridge Street Railway. Coakley was fired in 1886 when he led a strike for higher wages. He then went to work for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Sun">The New York Sun</a>" as a shorthand reporter. In 1888, he returned to Boston as sports writer for the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>". He was later promoted to sports editor. In addition to sports writing, Coakley also worked as a boxing referee. In 1892, Coakley left the "Herald" to attend <a href="Boston%20University%20Law%20School">Boston University Law School</a> and launch his first campaign for public office.

Early political career.
In 1892, Coakley was elected to the <a href="Massachusetts%20House%20of%20Representatives">Massachusetts House of Representatives</a> from <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>'s Ward 2. He was unseated in 1896 and moved to Boston, where he worked on the reelection campaign of Boston mayor <a href="John%20F.%20Fitzgerald">John F. Fitzgerald</a>. Fitzgerald later appointed Coakley to the Boston Park Commission. In 1909, Coakley managed the election campaign Suffolk County District Attorney <a href="Joseph%20C.%20Pelletier">Joseph C. Pelletier</a>.

Legal career.
Coakley read law at his brother Timothy's law firm. He failed his first three attempts at the bar exam. Coakley was admitted to the Massachusetts bar on July 9, 1897 and the federal bar on January 25, 1911.

In 1909, Coakley served as the defense attorney for <a href="George%20H.%20Battis">George H. Battis</a>, a former Boston Alderman who was charged with larceny from the city of Boston. Battis was found guilty on two charges of larceny. That same year Coakley served as defense counsel for Michael J. Mitchell the former head of Boston's supply department who was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the city and conspiracy to commit larceny. Coakley also served as counsel for William J. "Big Bill" Keliher. Keliher was convicted of aiding in the looting of the National City Bank of Cambridge. He and Coakley later had a disagreement, leading to an incident which the police were called to remove Keliher from Coakley's office. Keliher accused Coakley of taking money from Keliher to bribe United States Attorney <a href="Asa%20P.%20French">Asa P. French</a>, one French's assistants, and the jury. French did not believe Keliher's accusations and chose not to investigate.

In 1915, Coakley was hired to represent the Tylose Contracting Company before the Boston Finance Commission, which was investigating the usefulness and cost of the company's floor preservative. The commission's public hearings lasted over 30 days and more than 65 witnesses were called. The commission found that tylose was a suitable floor preservative, and although it criticized the price the city paid for it, found no graft.

Toodles affair.
Coakley developed a strong dislike for Boston Fitzgerald after he demanded the resignation of and testified in court against one of Coakley's clients, Michael J. Mitchell. In 1913, Elizabeth "Toodles" Ryan, a <a href="Cigarette%20girl%20%28person%29">cigarette girl</a> at an illegal gambling establishment, hired Coakley to represent her in lawsuit against her employer, Henry Mansfield, who she said had reneged on his promise to marry her. Ryan revealed to Coakley that she had kissed Fitzgerald and Coakley turned over this information to one of Fitzgerald's political rivals, <a href="James%20Michael%20Curley">James Michael Curley</a>. Coakley and Curley sent a letter revealing the affair to Fitzgerald's wife. Curley then announced a series a public lectures, including one entitled "Great Lovers in History; From Cleopatra to Toodles." Fitzgerald soon dropped out of the 1913 mayoral race (which Curley went on to win) and Curley never delivered the lecture. During Ryan's trial, Coakley elicited testimony from another man who had been involved with Ryan that he had witnessed Fitzgerald kiss Ryan. The incident was now a matter of official court record and made front page headlines, which started the decline of Fitzgerald's political career.

Alliance with Curley.
During Curley's first term, Coakley represented the Mayor during the <a href="Boston%20Finance%20Commission">Boston Finance Commission</a>'s investigation into Curley's finances. Coakley was able have the investigation dropped by having the case transfered to one of his allies, Suffolk County District Attorney Joseph Pelletier. In 1917, Curley made Coakley a trustee of the <a href="Boston%20Public%20Library">Boston Public Library</a>. Coakley and Curley later had a falling out after Curley attacked Pelletier, who was considering running against Curley for Mayor.

Ponzi.
Coakley served as an attorney for financier <a href="Charles%20Ponzi">Charles Ponzi</a>. Coakley received $25,000 a year from Ponzi in legal fees. Coakley turned in the money he had received from Ponzi to the receivers in Ponzi's bankruptcy case. Coakley, along with fellow attorney Daniel V. McIsaac, advised Ponzi not to fight the case, which, along with the urging of his wife, convinced Ponzi to plead guilty to federal charges in hopes of receiving a lighter sentence. Coakley was later called as a witness in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' case against Ponzi.

Disbarment.
On December 16, 1918, the council of the Boston Bar Association voted to investigate the conduct of Pelletier, Coakley, and Francis Carroll in connection with a case involving <a href="Emerson%20Motors%20Company">Emerson Motors Company</a>. Robert D. Weston was appointed to present evidence to the bar association's subcommittee investing the charges.

In July 1919, Michael J. Hayes, an investigator who had taken a job in Coakley's office at the behest of Weston in order to gather evidence for the bar association's investigation into Coakley, stole papers from Coakley's office and turned them over to <a href="Godfrey%20Lowell%20Cabot">Godfrey Lowell Cabot</a> of the <a href="Watch%20and%20Ward%20Society">Watch and Ward Society</a>.

In 1920, Coakley was a figure in the disbarment case of Alvah G. Sleeper. According to two members of the Massachusetts District Police, Sleeper told them that a client, whom they deduced to be Hollis H. Hunnewell, was being blackmailed by a woman over an alleged affair. Hunnewell had already paid a total of $150,000 over three occasions and was being asked for another $50,000. Sleeper advised Hunnewell to go to the <a href="Parker%20House">Parker House</a> as he had been requested to do and he would follow him. There, Sleeper observed Hunnewell meeting with Coakley, Pelletier, and another lawyer, John P. Feeney. Shortly thereafter a woman came to Sleeper's office and asked how much Coakley had received from Hunnewell. Sleeper told her that the amount was $150,000 and she stated that Coakley had not given her a fair share.

Following the publicity he received during Sleeper's disbarment hearing, Coakley decided to press matter of the stolen papers. On November 18, 1920, Cabot, Weston, Hector M. Holmes, and Oswin T. Bourdon were incited on charges of conspiracy to steal the property of Daniel H. Coakley. Two days later, Weston, Holmes, and Hayes were indicted on six counts with larceny of property owned by Coakley. Bourdon and Hayes plead guilty, but Cabot, Weston, and Holmes chose to go to trial. All three were found not guilty.

On September 29, 1921, the Boston Bar Association filed petitions for disbarment against Coakley, McIssac, and William J. Corcoran, along with a recommendation to <a href="Massachusetts%20Attorney%20General">Massachusetts Attorney General</a> <a href="J.%20Weston%20Allen">J. Weston Allen</a> that Pelletier be removed from office, alleging that the four were guilty of deceit, malpractice, and gross misconduct. The allegations against Coakley included:

On April 17, 1922, Coakley walked out of a hearing and dropped his defense, stating that he felt he could not get an impartial trial in that court.

On April 21, 1922, the <a href="Massachusetts%20Supreme%20Judicial%20Court">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a> found that Coakley was guilty of deceit, malpractice, and gross misconduct. On May 12, 1922 he was disbarred.

On May 16, 1922, United States Attorney <a href="Robert%20O.%20Harris">Robert O. Harris</a> filed a petition to disbar Coakley from practicing law in the <a href="United%20States%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">United States Circuit Court of Appeals</a>. Coakley failed to appear in court and was disbarred on July 3, 1922.

Legal problems.
In 1914, Coakley was sued by the widower of one of his clients, to recover the full amount of the $15,952 awarded to her in a suit against the <a href="Boston%20Elevated%20Railway">Boston Elevated Railway</a>. Coakley, who defended himself, received a favorable verdict.

In 1923, Coakley was sued by Meyer Berman, a former client who sought to recover $50,000 which he alleged Coakley had obtained from him through fraud. The charges were dismissed on January 8, 1924. Coakley was indicted for perjury in connection with his testimony in the Berman case, however the charges were dropped in February 1924. In 1933, <a href="Thomas%20C.%20O%27Brien">Thomas C. O'Brien</a>, who was district attorney at the time Coakley was charged with perjury, stated that subsequent evidence had shown that Coakley had not committed perjury and that no indictment should have been raised.

In 1924, Coakley and Corcoran were charged with extortion. On July 3, 1924, after nearly 27 hours of deliberation, the jury found Coakley and Corcoran not guilty on all counts. 

In 1926, Coakley was sued by another former client, Oda Pappathanos, who sought to recover money from Coakley that she alleged Coakley had obtained by misrepresenting the amount of money that had been received in the settlement of her claim against a wealthy Maine man. Coakley was found not guilty on July 31, 1926.

On November 14, 1934, a jury awarded $77,433.33 to Francis D. Reardon of Emerson & Co. for failure to pay a $50,000 note owed by Coakley and his son-in-law, Charles L. Murdock, to the company's deceased president, Bartholomew Crowley.

In 1933, with written support from a number of notable individuals, including Cardinal <a href="William%20Henry%20O%27Connell">Cardinal O'Connell</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Francis%20Lillis">Thomas Francis Lillis</a>, <a href="Louis%20J.%20Gallagher">Louis J. Gallagher</a>, <a href="Edwin%20Stark%20Thomas">Edwin Stark Thomas</a>, <a href="William%20Robinson%20Pattangall">William Robinson Pattangall</a>, <a href="Eugene%20N.%20Foss">Eugene N. Foss</a>, Thomas C. O'Brien, <a href="Alfred%20E.%20Smith">Alfred E. Smith</a>, <a href="James%20Roosevelt">James Roosevelt</a>, 65 judges, and 3,470 attorneys. Governor <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Ely">Joseph B. Ely</a> appeared in court on Coakley's behalf. His petition was denied by Judge Fred T. Field on March 28, 1934. Field wrote that Coakley's "deliberate misstatements" regarding his disbarment and his offer to admit guilt in exchange for readmission while also asserting his innocence showed a "lack of respect for the truth inconsistent with fitness for readmission to the bar".

Mayoral campaigns.
In 1925, Coakley ran for Mayor of Boston on a platform of clearing the name of Joseph Pelletier, who died shortly after he was removed for office. Coakley finished fourth behind <a href="Malcolm%20E.%20Nichols">Malcolm E. Nichols</a>, Theodore A. Glynn, and <a href="Joseph%20H.%20O%27Neil">Joseph H. O'Neil</a>, but ahead of Thomas C. O'Brien, <a href="John%20A.%20Keliher">John A. Keliher</a>, William T. A. Fitzgerald, <a href="Alonzo%20B.%20Cook">Alonzo B. Cook</a>, <a href="Charles%20L.%20Burrill">Charles L. Burrill</a>, and Walter G. McGauley. He ran again in 1929. He finished a distant third with 1% of the vote. He ran a third time in 1933, but dropped out of the race, stating that he feared his "candidacy was likely to result in the election of an enemy of the plain people". Coakley's purpose in all three campaigns was to siphon votes away from Curley or his proxy.

Massachusetts Governor's Council.
In 1932, Coakley was elected to the <a href="Massachusetts%20Governor%27s%20Council">Massachusetts Governor's Council</a>. Following Curley's election as Governor in 1934, he and Coakley reconciled, as Curley needed his assistance to secure patronage jobs. During his tenure on the Council, Coakley acted as a prosecuting officer in many removal proceedings brought by Governor Joseph M. Curley against state officials. He was able to secure 2,000 patronage jobs for men from his district on the <a href="Quabbin%20Reservoir">Quabbin Reservoir</a> project. During the administration of Curley's successor, <a href="Charles%20F.%20Hurley">Charles F. Hurley</a>, he was not involved in strategy and procedure. Instead his main role was as a critic of Lieutenant Governor <a href="Francis%20E.%20Kelly">Francis E. Kelly</a>.

Impeachment.
In 1938, Coakley wrote the petition for pardon for <a href="Raymond%20L.%20S.%20Patriarca">Raymond L. S. Patriarca</a>, a mobster who later became the reputed leader of organized crime in New England. The letter contained praise from three priests. One priest had been tricked into signing the letter, another had never been consulted, and the third, a "Father Fagin", did not exist. The Governor's Council approved Patriarca's pardon and he was released after only 84 days in jail.

On December 4, 1940, state representative <a href="Roland%20D.%20Sawyer">Roland D. Sawyer</a> called for Coakley's impeachment, alleging that Coakley had attempted to "thwart" the Special Legislative Pardon-Probe Commission by contacting witnesses, threatening them, and advising them to commit perjury. On June 9, 1941, a special House committee found that Coakley had used his position and influence to secure pardons in exchange for financial gain and recommended his impeachment. The findings were based on the pardons of Patriarca, Maurice Limon, and Frank W. Porter. On June 13, 1941, the House voted 144 to 75 in favor of impeachment.

Coakley's impeachment trial was the first in Massachusetts since 1821. Attorney General <a href="Robert%20T.%20Bushnell">Robert T. Bushnell</a> and state representative <a href="Benjamin%20Priest">Benjamin Priest</a> conducted the prosecution. Senator <a href="Joseph%20B.%20Harrington">Joseph B. Harrington</a> and attorney <a href="William%20H.%20Lewis">William H. Lewis</a> served as defense counsel. The trial lasted six weeks. On October 2, 1941, the <a href="Massachusetts%20Senate">Massachusetts Senate</a> found Coakley guilty on 10 of the 14 articles on impeachment. The Senate voted 28 to 10 to remove Coakley from office and 23 to 15 to bar him for life from holding a place of "profit or honor or trust" in the Commonwealth.

Later life.
Following his impeachment, Coakley ran for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>. In the Democratic primary he finished fourth out of four candidates with 7% of the vote.

During his final years, Coakley appeared less frequently in the public eye. By 1946 he was complaining about his poor financial state, however he was still able to keep a suite at the Parker House, a townhouse in <a href="Brighton%2C%20Boston">Brighton</a>, and a cottage in <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a>. He spent the final five years of his life in <a href="Buzzards%20Bay%2C%20Massachusetts">Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts</a>, where he died on September 18, 1952.

James William Robertson

James William Robertson was the first <a href="mayor%20of%20Queenstown%2C%20New%20Zealand">mayor of Queenstown, New Zealand</a>.

He was born in St John's, <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a>. His father owned a sawmill and he worked in the lumber trade. He was drawn to the <a href="Victorian%20gold%20rush">gold rush</a> in <a href="Ballarat">Ballarat</a>, Victoria, Australia. He set up with others and they spent three years using a water race, flume, galvanised piping and other methods. Eventually Robertson and some others travelled to the <a href="Shotover%20River">Shotover</a> near <a href="Queenstown%2C%20New%20Zealand">Queenstown</a> and saw the gold mining opportunities there. He set up a company with Dan and Frank McBride and Thos Hicks. They were timber millers at Kinloch, ship builders (including the Antrim), they built wharves at Queenstown, Frankton and Kingston. They owned land including large areas of the Frankton Flat. <a href="Bendix%20Hallenstein">Bendix Hallenstein</a> was a close business partner, and would become the second mayor of Queenstown. 

Robertson was elected mayor of Queenstown three times, and was elected as a representative of the Lakes District in the <a href="Otago%20Provincial%20Council">Otago Provincial Council</a> but sat for only one session. 

Robertson and Co. operated a sawmill at the 'Head of the Lake' (<a href="Glenorchy%2C%20New%20Zealand">Glenorchy</a>) near Queenstown and the company had a lumber yard in Beach Street, Queenstown. In 1865 he applied to establish a flour mill near Kawarau Falls with <a href="Bendix%20Hallenstein">Bendix Hallenstein</a>. They met government opposition with approval of the mill, the chief objection was that it would interfere with water rights. It became the topic of discussion at the Queenstown Improvement Committee meeting in September 1865. In May 1865 it was Robertson and Hallenstein who the Town Committee turned to, to plan the building of a new schoolhouse. 

In July 1866 a public meeting of electors was held in the <a href="Eichardt%27s%20Hotel">Queen's Arms Hotel</a> for the purpose of nominating and hearing candidates for the office of Mayor. Robertson won the nomination receiving 14 votes, Bendix Hallenstein received 13 votes and Dennis G Macdonnell received 9 votes. Robertson contested the election with a Mr W. Fuller of the Scandinavian Company, a new arrival. Queenstown's first mayoral election took place on Saturday 21 July 1866 with polling booths at Eichardt's Queen's Arms Hotel, and M'Larn's Prince of Wales Hotel. Two bank officials oversaw the polling, and rate-payers were allowed to vote. At half-past four o'clock the returning officer, R. Beetham, Esq., gave the results; Robertson-40, Fuller-29, and he pronounced Mr Robertson the first duly elected Mayor of Queenstown.

He was the <a href="Mayor%20of%20Queenstown%2C%20New%20Zealand">mayor of the Queenstown borough</a> from 1866 to 1869. The flour mill was eventually opened in July 1867. Mrs Robertson cracked a bottle of champagne at the opening ceremony. It was named the Brunswick Flour Mill as Robertson was from Brunswick (in modern day Canada) and Hallenstein was from <a href="Brunswick%2C%20Germany">Brunswick</a> (in modern day Germany). On 19 February 1868 his wife gave birth to a son at Queenstown. 

He died in 1876. Robertson Street in <a href="Frankton%2C%20Otago">Frankton</a> may have been named after him, although the mill was managed by another James Robertson, whose house was on the flat to the south of the Kawarau Falls. 

A turbine at the mill supplied electricity to the mill until 1926 when the Kawarau Falls dam was built. The turbine was later erected as a memorial near the end of Bridge Street, but in 2017 was moved to allow construction of the new two lane Kawarau Falls Bridge.

M. Ann Chapman (1937–23 May 2009) was a <a href="limnologist">limnologist</a>, one of the first New Zealand women scientists to visit Antarctica, and the first woman to lead a scientific expedition to Antarctica. <a href="Lake%20Chapman%20%28Antarctica%29">Lake Chapman</a>, in Antarctica's <a href="Ross%20Dependency">Ross Dependency</a>, was named for Chapman. Chapman spent most of her teaching career at the <a href="University%20of%20Waikato">University of Waikato</a>.

Early life and education.
Chapman was born in <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a> and studied at <a href="Southland%20Girls%27%20High%20School">Southland Girls' High School</a> and <a href="Otago%20Girls%27%20High%20School">Otago Girls' High School</a>. She graduated with a Masters of Science at the <a href="University%20of%20Otago">University of Otago</a> in 1960; her thesis was on the taxonomy and ecology of New Zealand freshwater <a href="ostracods">ostracods</a>. She worked at the Sydney Water Board in Australia before moving to Scotland to study toward a PhD at the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a>, which she completed in 1965. 

Career.
She worked at the University of Glasgow and the <a href="University%20of%20Auckland">University of Auckland</a> before being appointed as a senior lecturer at the University of Waikato in 1970 and promoted to Reader in 1975. She remained at the University of Waikato until her retirement in 1996.

In 1971, Chapman led a three-week scientific expedition to Antarctica, which made her one of the first women on the continent and the first woman to lead an Antarctic expedition. <a href="Lake%20Chapman%20%28Antarctica%29">Lake Chapman</a>, near Granite Harbour in Antarctica's Ross Sea Dependency, is named after Chapman.

Chapman and <a href="Vida%20Stout">Vida Stout</a> founded the New Zealand Limnological Society in 1967 (now the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Freshwater%20Sciences%20Society">New Zealand Freshwater Sciences Society</a>).

She co-authored the "Guide to the freshwater Crustacea of New Zealand", published in 1976, with Maureen Lewis. An updated version was published in 2011, which Chapman had been working on prior to her death.

Retirement.
Following her 1996 retirement, a special conference session was held in her honour, which resulted in a special section in the "New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research" published in 1999. In the foreword to the special issue, Chapman was recalled as being "very relaxed" with a "healthy disrespect for minor rules and regulations that bedevil large institutions, and willing to turn a blind eye to student pranks".

Chapman's final years were plagued with ill health, but she converted her nursing home room into an office and continued to write, including working on a draft of an updated version of the freshwater Crustacea guide.

After working as a senior project manager with <a href="SAP%20SE">SAP SE</a> software, Clements identified an unmet need for early stage funding for food and beverage start-ups. In 2014 she launched a food crowdfunding platform called fundafeast, which failed.

In October 2016, Clements launched a new version, named "PieShell" as a tribute to her mother's pie business. The site launched with four campaigns that included a hot dog truck and a ketchup product. In mid-2017, PieShell was hosting around 30 campaigns. 

PieShell requires anyone wanting to launch a campaign on the site to first pledge to another active campaign; this is to foster a sense of community. A campaign is initially hosted on a private page, and must raise 25% of its fundraising target from people with whom the people running the campaign have shared the link; once that milestone is reached, the campaign is made visible and open to the public. People who give money can receive rewards from the campaign. 

The venture was financed in part by a <a href="GoFundMe">GoFundMe</a> campaign and initially operated out of a <a href="Spacious">Spacious</a> coworking space. The site makes money by keeping 6% of the funds raised in a campaign.

Vegetarian symbols.

Packaged food products sold in <a href="India">India</a> are required to be labelled with a mandatory mark in order to be distinguished between vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The symbol is in effect following the "Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Act of 2006", and got a mandatory status after the framing of the respective regulations ("Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulation") in 2011. According to the law, vegetarian food should be identified by a green symbol and non-vegetarian food with a brown symbol.

V-label.
The V-label, a V with a leaf, originated with the <a href="European%20Vegetarian%20Union">European Vegetarian Union</a>. The V-Label is a standardized European vegetarian label from the EVU with the aim of easy identification of vegetarian products and services.

Vegan symbols.

Seedling emoji.
On internet forums and social networks, the seedling emoji 🌱 is sometimes used to symbolize veganism or vegan products.

Veganarchy symbol.
The <a href="Veganarchy">Veganarchy</a> symbol, first introduced in print in Brian A. Dominick's "Animal Liberation and Social Revolution" pamphlet in 1995, combines the Circle-V with the Circle-A of <a href="anarchist">anarchist</a> symbolism.
Flag.
The vegan flag is a <a href="Glossary%20of%20vexillology%23Flag%20identification%20symbols">civil flag</a> intended to represent veganism. The flag consists of three blue and green triangles forming the letter V, the first letter in the word "vegan". 
Inspired by the LGBT <a href="rainbow%20flag">rainbow flag</a>, the flag was created in hopes of uniting animal rights organizations and activists. The flag was designed by Gad Hakimi, an <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i designer and vegan activist, in cooperation with a group of other graphic designers and activists from several countries. As part of a project involving a vegan superhero, Hakimi discovered that there is variation in in colors used to symbolize veganism. He opened a network group including activists and designers from around the world who designed the flag collaboratively. 
Originally, some members of the group suggested that animals should be featured on the flag, with red colours featuring prominently to symbolize the blood of slaughtered animals. However, the group eventually chose to make the flag about human-animal equality, not about animals themselves.
The colors white, green and blue were chosen to represent the natural habitats of animals: sky, land, and sea. The letter V is an inverted pyramid intended to symbolize the ability to do the impossible.

The <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> news website "<a href="Stuff.co.nz">Stuff.co.nz</a>" criticized the flag as too similar to the <a href="Red%20Peak%20flag">Red Peak flag</a>, which was rejected in the <a href="New%20Zealand%20flag%20referendums%2C%202015%E2%80%9316">New Zealand flag referendums, 2015–16</a>.

George E. McNeill

George Edwin McNeill (1836-1906), was an American mill worker, labor leader, and writer. McNeill is best remembered for a pioneering study of the American labor movement, "The Labor Movement, or, the Problem of To-day," published in 1892.

Biography.
Early years.
George Edwin McNeill was born August 4, 1836, in <a href="Amesbury%2C%20Massachusetts">Amesbury</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. McNeill worked in various Amesbury textile mills from childhood, going to work in the Amesbury Woolen Company at the age of ten. This lead McNeill to participation in an 1851 strike, when he was a boy of just 15. Strikers demanded a shortening of the working day to 10 hours at the mill, which the owner, the Salisbury Company, refused. When McNeill and the other workers abandoned their posts, mill owners terminated the employment of all, hiring a new crew of 50 Irish immigrants to operate the machinery of the facility.

Needing to find a new line of employment after termination in the strike, McNeill apprenticed as a shoemaker, learning that craft and moving to <a href="Boston">Boston</a> in 1856.

Career.
In Boston McNeill became politically active, joining the <a href="Sons%20of%20Temperance">Sons of Temperance</a> and serving multiple times as an officer in that organization. He also became involved in the movement to institute the <a href="8-hour%20day">8-hour day</a>, co-founding the Grand Eight Hour League in Boston in 1863. This organization would change its name in 1868 to the Boston Eight Hour League. McNeill would serve as president of the Eight Hour League for eight years, taking part in that capacity in the successful lobbying of the state legislature for passage of a 10-hour day law in Massachusetts.

McNeill was the founder of the <a href="Working%20Men%27s%20Institute">Working Men's Institute</a> in Boston, and worked with abolitionist <a href="Wendell%20Phillips">Wendell Phillips</a> and Massachusetts Governor <a href="William%20Claflin">William Claflin</a> to establish the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor, the first labor bureau in the United States. Upon that body's formation he was named deputy chief by Governor Claflin.

McNeill became involved with the <a href="Sovereigns%20of%20Industry">Sovereigns of Industry</a> and was elected Massachusetts State Secretary of that organization. He was also involved in pioneer labor newspapers throughout the Northeastern United States, including the "<a href="New%20York%20Labor%20Standard">New York Labor Standard</a>," the "Fall River Labor Standard," and the Boston "Voice," among others. He was also the founder of the "Boston Labor Leader."

In 1874, McNeill served as a delegate to a labor congress in <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, for which he wrote a declaration of principles which was later adopted by the <a href="Knights%20of%20Labor">Knights of Labor</a>. He would himself join the Knights in 1883, assuming a prominent role in the leadership of District 30, the largest division of that organization. In 1884 he was elected Treasurer of District 30.

During this era there there were few job safety rules and no provision for state workmen's compensation in the event of on the job accidents; insurance was frequently expensive and impossible for the working class to obtain. Consequently, in 1883 McNeill founded the Massachusetts Accident Company, designed to provide low cost insurance to factory workers in the state.

McNeill became directly involved in electoral politics in 1886, running as a labor candidate for Mayor of Boston.

McNeill studied the world of organized labor extensively and was the editor of and a contributor to the 1892 book, "The Labor Movement, or, the Problem of To-day," regarded as one of the first comprehensive histories of the American labor movement.

A <a href="Christian%20socialism">Christian socialist</a>, McNeill was an active member of the Episcopal Christian Socialist Church of the Carpenter in Boston, becoming a senior warden of that body in 1891. He was a staunch <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> in politics and was active in the 1896 Presidential campaign to elect <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>.

McNeill was also a poet of some renown and published a 1903 volume of his literary work.

Death and legacy.
On Thursday, May 17, 1906, McNeill was suddenly stricken by intestinal pain and was rushed to the hospital in <a href="Somerville%2C%20Massachusetts">Somerville, Massachusetts</a>. An emergency operation was conducted, but McNeill was unable to survive the trauma, and he faded and died on May 19, 1906. McNeill was 69 years old at the time of his death.

Numerous leaders of the American labor movement were in attendance at his funeral, with the eulogy delivered by <a href="Samuel%20Gompers">Samuel Gompers</a>, President of the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Labor">American Federation of Labor</a>.

Calthwaite Hall, near <a href="Penrith%2C%20Cumbria">Penrith</a> in <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a> is a house of historical significance and is listed on the English Heritage Register. It was built in 1837 for Thomas Dixon Esq and was the home of many notable people for the next 150 years. It was now a venue for weddings and other special events and also provides accommodation.

Early residents.
Thomas Dixon (1799-1846) built Calthwaite Hall in 1837. His father also called Thomas Dixon bought the Calthwaite estate in 1791 from the Duke of Devonshire. It seems that there was a house here at this time which was altered by Thomas’s father as a book written in 1811 refers to “Calthwaite Hall, the improved mansion of Thomas Dixon.” 

Thomas was a solicitor who had a business in <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a>. In 1830 he married Mary Jane Parker who was the daughter of Christopher Parker, a wealthy landowner who owned Petteril Green. When he built the new Calthwaite Hall in 1837 he employed the famous landscaper <a href="William%20Sawrey%20Gilpin">William Sawrey Gilpin</a> to lay out the gardens. A description of the property was contained in a Directory of 1847. It stated.

Thomas sold the Hall in 1843 and the advertisement for the sale is shown. It was bought by William Hammond Ambler from <a href="Bishop%20Auckland">Bishop Auckland</a>. He sold it in 1848.

It was in the occupation of a series of tenants until the 1880s when it was bought by Joseph Harris.

Later residents.
Joseph Harris (1859-1946) bought Calthwaite Hall in about 1885. He is shown in the 1891 Census living there with some of his family and a butler, cook, maid, two housemaids and a kitchen maid. He was born in 1859 in <a href="Greysouthen">Greysouthen</a> <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>. He was part of a wealthy family who were long established land and colliery owners in this area. He went to school at Aldin House, Slough. In 1895 he was the High Sheriff of Cumberland. 

He married Hope Knowles (1873-1947) in 1896 and the couple had three children. In 1901 he commissioned the famous architect Sir <a href="Robert%20Lorimer">Robert Lorimer</a> to build Brackenburgh. The 1901 Census shows Lorimer who is listed as a visitor at Calthwaite Hall. Brackenburgh was completed in about 1903 and the family moved there and rented Calthwaite Hall to various tenants. One of the first was <a href="Charles%20Howard%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Carlisle">Viscount Morpeth</a>.

Viscount Morpeth whose full name was Charles James Stanley Howard, 10th Earl of Carlisle (1867-1912) rented Calthwaite Hall in about 1905 as his country residence. Charles was born in 1867 in <a href="London">London</a>. His father George James Howard owned <a href="Castle%20Howard">Castle Howard</a> and <a href="Naworth%20Castle">Naworth Castle</a>. He went to Oxford University and obtained a BA in 1889. In 1894 he married Rhoda L’Estrange and the couple had four children. He fought in the Boer War and was a Member of Parliament. He inherited his father’s title in 1911.

After the Howard family left Hubert Lawrence (1859-1939) was the tenant for many years. He was a wealthy East India Merchant who married late in life at the age of 53. He was interested in sporting and social activities. He lived at Calthwaite Hall with his wife Mary until his death in 1939.

In about 1950 the Pattinson became residents of Calthwaite Hall and remained there for many years until recently when it became wedding venue and accommodation facility.

James Thompson (American politician)

James Thompson is a US army veteran and civil rights attorney in Witchita, Kansas, and an American politician. He received major attention during his 2017 congressional campaign, in which he shocked American politics by receiving 46% of the vote as a Democrat in a traditionally very Republican district.

Bibliography.
James had a difficult childhood, in which he spent some times in homelessness. He later joined the US Army, an experience he says "changed his life". He retired from the military in the presidential honour guard. He then attended the Wichita State University, where he went on to earn his J.D. in Law.

James currently lives with his wife, and has one daughter.

Congressional Campaign.
James Thompson was a candidate in <a href="Kansas%27s%204th%20congressional%20district%20special%20election%2C%202017">Kansas's 4th congressional district special election, 2017</a>, opposing the republican candidate <a href="Ron%20Estes">Ron Estes</a>. In the <a href="2016%20US%20Presidential%20Election">2016 US Presidential Election</a>, Donald Trump won this district by 27 points. As such, the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> (DNC) estimated that a democrat had no chance to win in this district, and invested little effort into winning it. James Thompson had to rely on small donations to run his campaign. James Thompson was also endorsed by <a href="Our%20Revolution">Our Revolution</a>. In the week before the election, polls showed Estes's lead narrowing, and a possibility of a victory for Thompson. The Estes Campaign started putting more efforts into advertising at this point, and vice-president <a href="Mike%20Pense">Mike Pense</a> and president <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> made a robocall for constituents of the 4th districts to make sure they vote for Estes.

He accumulated 46% of the vote but lost to the Republican candidate, who received 52.2%. His score was surprisingly high for a Democrat in this congressional district, which was considered to be a safe Republican seat before the campaign. 

Significance.
Anti-Trump Backlash.
According to Mediaite, "The closeness of the contest will be interpreted as a warning shot from voters as the 2018 midterms approach and Democrats energized since Trump’s election as president".

Significance to Berniecrats.
According to <a href="Kyle%20Kulinski">Kyle Kulinski</a> of Secular Talk, James Thompson's campaign success calls into question the DNC's strategy of running centrist (<a href="Blue%20Dog%20Coalition">blue dog</a>) democrats in the most conservative district. He argued that that "the only reason Estes won is because he was propped up by big money", and that "grassroots populists" like James Thompson had a chance of winning in other republican districts the national democrats already gave up on.

Mercantile Movements Division (Royal Navy)

The Mercantile Movements Division originally known as the Convoy Section was a component part of <a href="Admiralty%20Naval%20Staff">British Admiralty, Naval Staff</a> department that coordinated, organised and plotted all <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Merchant Navy</a> <a href="Convoys%20in%20World%20War%20I">convoys</a>, routing and schedules from 1917 until 1920.

History.
Responsibility for the convoy system was administered by the Admiralty as early as 1914. A specific Convoy Section of the Naval Staff was originally established 25 June 1917 as part of the <a href="Anti-Submarine%20Division%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Anti-Submarine Division</a> with the appointment of an "Organizing Manager of Convoys" the Convoy Section coordinated with the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Shipping%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Shipping</a> who was responsible for <a href="Merchant%20shipping">Merchant Shipping</a> and the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Naval Intelligence Division</a> to organise all convoy, routings and schedules. Although planning of routes for all convoys including there escorting vessels was usually supervised by the <a href="Assistant%20Chief%20of%20the%20Naval%20Staff">Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff</a> as he was responsible for trade protection and anti-submarine operations.

In September 1917 the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> dually became responsible for the control of the ships of the <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Merchant Navy</a> together with the movements of the British Fleet. It established the Mercantile Movements Division under the control of a Director of Mercantile Movements to administer this arrangement. However, in the case of convoys a different system had to be devised, This was owing to the difficulty of transmitting information and the problems it caused unless complete control over any convoy when it was finally at sea had to come under jurisdiction of the Admiralty when this was agreed to the movements of convoys for the majority of there journey would then be directed by the Mercantile Movements Division and convoys were usually “plotted” from day to day.

In order to avert as many problems as possible certain alternative measures were adopted, for example convoys when travelling at night without lights had to be diverted of one another. In order to achieve this use of wireless telegraphy was employed to transmit course changes to convoys, particularly if they came within close 'proximity' of each other. They were also directed to avoid certain areas where it was known German <a href="U-boat%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">U-boat's</a> were operating. Other measures put in place involved altering agreed destination of some ships as they approached home waters.

As convoys approached from the <a href="North-East%20Atlantic">North East Atlantic</a> and U.K. home waters, usually being the <a href="Celtic%20Sea">Celtic</a>, <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish</a>, <a href="North%20Sea">North</a> Sea's and <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, they would then be within the strategic responsibility of the Commanders-in-Chief, of the <a href="Coast%20of%20Ireland%20Station">Coast of Ireland</a>, <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20Plymouth">Devonport</a>, <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, and the Commander of the <a href="Dover%20Patrol">Dover Patrol</a>, at that point they were taken in charge by one or other of them. Port staff would keep a record of all movements of ships passing through or working within in each Command, this enabled area Commander-in-Chief to action operational requirements where they deemed necessary. During the <a href="interwar%20years">interwar years</a> the division was disbanded as a distinct entity and its previous functions were amalgamated within the <a href="Tactical%20Division%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Tactical Division</a>. In 1939 at the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20Two">World War Two</a> the <a href="Trade%20Division%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Trade Division</a> assumed overall responsibility for planning, control and protection of all British merchant shipping from the Tactical Division until 1945.

The opera's subtitle alludes to the play's subtitle, "Aleluya erotica en un prologo y tres escenas" ("An erotic lace-paper valentine in a prologue and three scenes"). It is in German "Vier Bilder eines erotischen Bilderbogens in der Art eines Kammerspiels von Federico García Lorca" (Four images of an erotic valentine in the way of a chamber play by F. G.

Music.
Lorca had described his text as ever-changing between lyric and grotesque elements, and as fragmentary.

Ceinture 21 to 35

Ceinture 21 to 35 were a class of fifteen French 0-6-0T locomotives of the "Syndicat d'Exploitation des Chemins de fer de Ceinture de Paris." built in 1899 for pulling suburban passenger trains. 

The locomotives were built in 1899 by the <a href="Chemins%20de%20fer%20du%20Nord">Chemins de fer du Nord</a>'s Hellemmes and La Chapelles Workshops based on the design of the <a href="Chemins%20de%20fer%20de%20l%27Ouest">Chemins de fer de l'Ouest</a>'s <a href="Ouest%203531%20to%203602">3501 to 3602 series</a> (later État 30-101 to 30-202).

The Nord made several changes: the use of a Belpaire firebox, higher boiler pressure (), Adams safety valves, smaller driving wheels () and Nord-type sandboxes.

In 1934 at the dissolution of the "Syndicat" they passed to the Nord who renumbered them 3.901 to 3.915. Six were scrapped in 1936, leaving nine to pass to the <a href="SNCF">SNCF</a> at nationalisation in 1938. The SNCF renumbered them 2-030.TB.1 to 2-030.TB.9.

The remaining locomotives were scrapped between 1939 and 1953. None were preserved.

He was a regular starter for his team as they participated in the Northern Tohoku University Baseball League. In his 3rd year, he won all of his starts, and grabbed the league's title for best pitcher with an untarnished ERA of 0.00. The following year, he finished with a 0.45 ERA, won the league MVP and best nine award, and helped his team win the championships. He left the league with a 12-1 win-loss record.

Along with fellow draftees <a href="Kento%20Itohara">Kento Itohara</a> and <a href="Y%C5%ABsuke%20%C5%8Cyama">Yūsuke Ōyama</a>, Taiki joined the main roster's spring training camp. His 150 kph fastball was highly regarded by coaches, so he remained with the main roster until the camp ended. However, due to his lackluster performance during the pre-season games (3 games, 6.55 ERA), he was sent back to the farms before opening day..

He debuted on May 21 match against the Yakult Swallows in Meiji Jingu, where he pitted against fellow uni-drafted rookie Tomoya Hoshi. While he gave up 4 earned runs including 2 home runs and didn't grab the win, Hanshin won the match when they took back the lead on the 7th.

Playing Style.
With an overhand delivery, he throws a a <a href="four-seam%20fastball">four-seam fastball</a> averaging 145 kph (tops out at 151 kph), a <a href="forkball">forkball</a> clocked at low 130s, an occasional <a href="curveball">curveball</a>, and a solid <a href="slider">slider</a> that ranges from 120-140kph. His fastest pitch ever recorded was a 153 kph fastball, thrown during spring camp training.

Trivia.

Francis Thornton (Soldier)

Lt. Francis Thornton of Rolling Hill (October 22, 1747 – November 18, 1808) was a planter and soldier during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Thornton served as cornet of Lee's Legion of Light Dragoons commanded by <a href="Henry%20Lee%20III">Major-General Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee</a>. Thornton went onto serve as a Lieutenant in the Charlotte County Militia in the later part of the Revolution. Thornton was the son of <a href="William%20Thornton%20%28Virginia%20burgess%29">William Thornton</a> a Burgess for Brunswick County, Virginia and a great-great-grandson of <a href="William%20Thornton%20%28immigrant%29">William Thornton</a> who arrived in Virginia from England as late as 1646 settling in <a href="Gloucester%20County%2C%20Virginia">Gloucester County, Virginia</a>. Thornton was commonly known as "Frank Thornton" as indicated in the historical record and often referred to as "Francis Thornton of Rolling Hill" to differentiate him from his cousins Francis Thornton of Fall Hill and Francis Thornton of Society Hill. Thornton was a distant cousin of Presidents <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> and <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>.

Early life and education.
Thornton was born in <a href="Gloucester%20County%2C%20Virginia">Gloucester County, Virginia</a> to William Thornton a prominent Colonial Burgess and Judge and Jane Clack, the granddaughter of the Rev. James Clack. His parents were first cousins and benefited greatly not just the primogeniture status that settle a comfortable size estate upon William Thornton but also from an estate passed matrilineal from Peter Sterling, a seventeenth century surgeon with landholdings in Gloucester County, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland. By 1753, Thornton's family removed to Brunswick County, Virginia where is father gained significant economic and political control. Thornton's formal education is not known, however inferred information from legal documents and the historical record indicate he received a formal education and was fully literate. Thornton married and set up his own household by 1769 obtaining land settled upon him in what is today Charlotte County, Virginia.

American Revolution.
Thornton was commissioned as cornet in <a href="Lee%27s%20Legion">Lee's Legion</a> of Light Dragoons on April 21, 1778 serving until January 1, 1779. The majority of his period of service in the Continental ranks was training and foraging, his troop was involved in the retaliatory skirmish known as the "Battle of Edgar's Lane" on September 30, 1778 near Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. Thornton resigned his commission at the beginning of 1779, likely for needs of his family and plantation. In April of 1780 Thornton took the Oath of Allegiance and mustered in as 2nd Lieutenant of the Charlotte County Militia. The Militia formed two companies which marched south to join <a href="General%20Gates">Horatio Gates</a> in the failed <a href="Battle%20of%20Camden">Battle of Camden</a> in South Carolina. Thornton appears to not have been among those militiamen captured by the British in the aftermath of the campaign. Thornton's company joined <a href="Nathanael%20Greene">General Greene's</a> army and partook in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guilford%20Courthouse">Battle of Guilford Courthouse</a>. His company returned to Virginia following the battle and he was discharged of his services that year.

Family.
The name of Thornton's first wife is not known. No surviving primary sources record her identity and their is some dispute as to who she was. Thornton's great-grandsons Cecil Miller Armistead and Henry Venable Armistead recorded that their great-grandmother was a "Miss Wyatt". Thornton's great-granddaughter Lola Jane Carr Bates wrote a brief family history in 1913 in which she recorded his first wife as a "Miss Lacy" and his second as Lucy Ligon. Bates research has proved to have errors, the marriage recorded in her history between "Frank Thornton" and Lucy Ligon has shown in the historical record to have occurred in 1873 between Thornton's great-grandson also known as Frank Thornton and Lucy Daniel Ligon of Charlotte County, Virginia. What exists in the historical record provides evidence that the information provided by the Armistead brothers in the late 19th century is likely to be correct. Thornton was involved in a number of land transactions and legal actions with the Wyatt family and John Wyatt of Charlotte County, Virginia served as witness to his will and one of his executors. Thornton's second marriage was recorded October 15, 1801 to Anne Pettus. 

Children of Francis Thornton:


Later years.
In the post Revolutionary period, Thornton was a prominent and successful planter in Charlotte County, Virginia. His farm complex was surveyed by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources in 1997. The main house burned in 2016 and does not survive. Thornton died November 18, 1808, his estate was disputed amongst his children and not settled until 1826. 

Ancestry.
Thornton was a cousin of U.S. Presidents <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> and <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> through his great-grandfather <a href="William%20Thornton">William Thornton</a>. Both presidents were matrilineal descendants of William Thornton. Thornton was a second cousin of North Carolina Chief Justice <a href="Thomas%20Ruffin">Thomas Ruffin</a> through Capt. James Clack and his wife Mary Sterling.

Security researchers demonstrated that the toy itself was insecure and could be trivially accessed via Bluetooth. The personal records of over 820,000 owners of the toy were stored in an insecure <a href="MongoDB">MongoDB</a> database. Attackers also replaced the database with a ransom demand pointing to a <a href="Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> address.

Banting was raised in the Perth suburb of <a href="Tuart%20Hill%2C%20Western%20Australia">Tuart Hill</a>. She made a memorable debut for Western Australia as a 14-year old in the Under 15s, in a match in which the WA team defeated New South Wales. At the 2012 Under 18 national titles, she scored 86 runs for WA, including 26 in the fifth-place final against South Australia.

After making her Fury debut in 2014–15, Banting was selected in the Shooting Stars squad to tour to Dubai in March–April 2015. She then became the Fury's number one keeper, ahead of veteran <a href="Jenny%20Wallace">Jenny Wallace</a>, for its 2015–16 <a href="Women%27s%20National%20Cricket%20League">WNCL</a> campaign, and also kept wickets for the Scorchers in four matches during its inaugural <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Women%27s%20Big%20Bash%20League%20season">WBBL|01 season (2015–16)</a>.

Dagny Berger

Dagny Berger née Hansen (1903–1950) was Norway's first woman aviator. She was granted her certificate by the <a href="Royal%20Aero%20Club">Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom</a> in September 1927.

Biography.
Born on 16 September 1903 in <a href="Asker">Asker</a>, Dagny Hansen was the daughter of the carpenter and later farmer Otto Hansen Berger (1864–1932) and Olava Petrine Eriksen (unmarried). Her name was changed from Hansen to Berger in 1910 when her parents bought the Berger Gård farm in <a href="B%C3%A6rum">Bærum</a>. When she had finished her schooling, Berger was employed as a housemaid, a common practice at the time.

In 1923, Berger became one of the first Norwegian women to take her driving licence. She took part in car racing events in Finland. Her first car was a two-seater <a href="Willys%20Overland">Willys Overland</a>. A keen driver, she had difficulty in covering the costs of motoring as a maid. As a result, she began to sell books and watches before working in a fruit and cigar shop in <a href="Stabekk">Stabekk</a>.

She became interested in flying after reading about female aviators in other countries. After being refused access to the military flying school at <a href="Kjeller">Kjeller</a> in the spring of 1927, the following June she began training at the <a href="de%20Havilland">De Havilland</a> flying school at <a href="Stag%20Lane%20Aerodrome">Stag Lane Aerodrome</a> near <a href="London">London</a> where she learnt to fly the <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">DH60 Moth</a>. On 27 September she received her certificate, No. 8160, from the Royal Aero Club.

Back in Norway, she attempted to open her own business for sightseeing and passenger flights but there was little interest in passenger flights in Norway at the time. Instead, from 1929 she worked as a governess in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Nice">Nice</a>. She returned to Norway in 1933, working first in a restaurant before setting up a travel bureau. It closed in 1949.

Dagny Berger lost her life on 10 May 1950 when she was accidentally drowned in <a href="Bygd%C3%B8y">Bygdøy</a>. She was only 46. A street in Bærum, Dagny Bergersvei, is named in her memory.

Berenice Wyer

Annie Berenice Crumb Wyer was a <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> lecturer, pianist, song lyricist and composer.

Early life.
Annie Berenice Crumb was born in October 1876 in Connecticut to Ellen V. (née Peck) and Desevignè Starks Crumb, but spent most of her childhood in Missouri.

Crumb attended successively <a href="Forest%20Park%20%28St.%20Louis%29">Forest Park</a> University and Hosmer Hall (under Louise McNair), her musical education during all this time being under the guidance of Ernest Kroeger, and included pianoforte playing, harmony, counterpoint, and exercises in writing in the strict forms, including canon and fugue. She then supplemented her education in later years by a systematic study of musical form, history, biography and folklore music.

After five years of study in St. Louis, Crumb went to New York, where she became one of two pupils of <a href="Franz%20Rummel">Franz Rummel</a>, one of the greatest pianists of his day. When Rummel went to Holland and Germany for a tournée, she went to Boston and became a pupil of <a href="Carl%20Baermann">Carl Baermann</a>, who was recognized as the leading pianist and teacher.

Career.
After four years of studying under Baermann, Berenice Crumb made her debut at <a href="Steinert%20Hall">Steinert Hall</a>, Boston, giving a pianoforte recital. The critics were unanimous in recognizing her work as that of a high-class artist. Mr. Baermann invited an old friend, who was a severe critic, to hear her recital in Steinert Hall, Boston, but he declined. "I never listen to pupils' recitals," he declared. However he was coaxed to attend and afterwards sent him this message: "This young lady is a genius. I kiss her finger tips." A tour abroad followed the recital in Boston, with a year's study under Heinrich Barth, in Berlin.

In May 1904, Wyer performed at the piano at the General Federation of Women's Club, in St. Louis.

In 1911 Wyer lectured before the Piano Club of Kirkwood, gave lecture recitals in St. Louis, which were valuable not alone to every serious student of music, but as a help to concert-goers toward an intelligent appreciation of the great musical works.

Her field was cantillation, the combining of spoken words and music. In this she collaborated with Ethan Allen Taussig, at first using the stage name of "Felix Weidelmann". The unusual success of Wyer and Taussig in their recitals was mainly due to the perfect adjustment and balance of spoken words and music, thus giving the presentation a complete organic unity. Their repertoire included several of the best known works in this field, as well as several novelties, like "<a href="Enoch%20Arden%20%28Strauss%29">The Enoch Arden</a>" and "<a href="The%20Courtship%20of%20Miles%20Standish">Myles Standish</a>". Other shorter cantillations were "King Robert of Sicily", "The Witches' Song", Bergliot.

In 1914 Wyer put to music the tragedy of "Paolo and Francesca" by <a href="Stephen%20Phillips">Stephen Phillips</a>, a theme of poets from <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> to <a href="Gabriele%20D%27Annunzio">Gabriele D'Annunzio</a>. This cantillation, like her earlier work, "Miles Standish", was built upon the "leit motiv" idea, each principal character having its own musical phrase, which recurs under different guises as the emotions vary in the progress of the story. "Paolo and Francesca" was performed at the Social Union, Amherst, on February 5, 1920, with Adele Hoes Lee, reader, and Wyer, piano.

Together with Taussig, Wyer performed at the St. Louis College Club, <a href="Shurtleff%20College">Shurtleff College</a> (Alton), the Wednesday Club, and for an entertainment in honor of the National Federation of Women's Clubs.

Wyer was the composer of "Chivalric Poem" (ballade in C sharp minor for piano), "Serenade", "Etude in D Minor" (for organ), "Lento Assai" (for organ), "Meditation" (for organ), "Of Romance" (ballade in C sharp minor for piano). 
Wyer composed several art songs, among them "I Have A Rendezvous With Death", "Requiescat", "To Ships", "Remembrance", "The Mocking Bird", "Spring Fantasie", "Twilight in the Garden". Noteworthy were a setting from <a href="Paul%20Verlaine">Paul Verlaine</a>'s "The Sky Above The Roofing Lies", and one from <a href="Charles%20Baudelaire">Charles Baudelaire</a>'s "Tropic Memories".

Personal life and family.
Back home from her European tour, on June 11, 1901 Berenice Crumb married Dr. Harry Gage Wyer (June 27, 1870, <a href="Woburn%2C%20Massachusetts">Woburn, Massachusetts</a> - January 15, 1961, <a href="Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts">Brookline, Massachusetts</a>), the son of Edwin F. Wyer and Abbie A. Farrar, of <a href="Kirkwood%2C%20Missouri">Kirkwood, Missouri</a>. Dr. Wyer was a general practioner who first attended <a href="Phillips%20Academy">Phillips Academy</a>, Andover and then graduated from <a href="Harvard%20Medical%20School">Harvard Medical School</a> (class 1896, A.B.; M.D. 1900), and was a resident at St. Louis's hospital. Crumb and Wyer met in Boston while attending college, and after finishing her musical course in Boston she returned to St. Louis to do concert work for two years. Wyer followed her and they married in St. Louis. They had three children, Beatrice (later Holder), Richard F. (Harvard, Class of 1928) and Harold E. (November 13, 1913 - December 21, 2013) (<a href="Bowdoin%20College">Bowdoin College</a>, Class of 1937).

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Harry Gage Wyer became an Army Medical Corps Major as surgeon. After the war, Dr. Wyer went to work at William Beaumont Hospital, El Paso, Texas. Wyer was Professor of Military Science and Tactics at <a href="Harvard%20Medical%20School">Harvard Medical School</a> in 1927, giving courses on medicomilitary subjects for students who were candidates for the Medical Officers Reserve Corps. In 1941 Dr. Wyer was professor of Medico-Military Science at <a href="University%20of%20Vermont">University of Vermont</a>. In 1941, Maj. Harry Gage Wyer, who at 71 years old was one of the Army's oldest company commanders, received the praise of his superior officer for the "fine spirit which has fired American medical officers since the war independence." Wyer, who at the time was living in Brookline, returned to active duty for <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> when Army examiners reported him fit. He became a commander of Company B, declining an office assignment. He ended the war as Liutenant Colonel.

The Harold and Faith Wyer Scholarship Fund, established in 2007 in support of scholarships to Bowdoin undergraduates, was founded by Judith L. Wyer (died 2013), in honor of her parents, Harold and Faith B. Wyer (1918-2009). When Harold Wyer was a young man he developed an enthusiasm for short-wave radios. He built his own sets, qualified for commercial broadcasting, and while in the U.S. Navy during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> served as a radio technician and a member of the Naval Reserve Radio Division. While at Bowdoin College, he joined Theta Delta Chi fraternity, and was the assistant manager of the swim team and a member of the rifle team. After college he worked for General Electric Co. and Bethlehem Steel Co.

They first appeared in the late 1960s, after a Soviet decree was approved on 24 September 1968 to reform research and development structures; by 1980 there were 250 NPOs in the Soviet Union.

NPOs were established to consolidate research and production activities into a single entity. They were meant to bridge the technological gap between design bureaus and production plants, as new designs were often developed without considering the technical capabilities of the production facilities, leading to long delays between the start of development and serial production.

They are usually headed by a research or design organization. Though they exist in many sectors, they are most common in electrical engineering, electronics, aviation, instrument-making and chemical industries.

This <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Java">invasion</a> happened in 1293. In Sekar inscription, it is written that main production foundries of Cetbang is in Rajakwesi, Bojonegoro, whereas the black powder is produced in Swatantara Biluluk.

Usage in Majapahit Era.
Majapahit Kingdom dominated the Nusantaran archipelago because technologies to cast and forge bronze and ability to mass-produce them in local buildings. Majapahit also pioneered manufacture and usage of firearms in large scale as part of warfare. The usage of cannons is widely used by Majapahit navy, <a href="Piracy">pirates</a>, and other neighboring kingdoms in Nusantara.

The size of cetbang used by Majapahit navy varies from 1 meter to 3 meter in length. Three meter long cetbang usually used by larger ship in Majapahit Navy (see <a href="Junk%20%28ship%29">Jung</a>).

German Radio Intelligence Operations during World War II

German Radio Intelligence Operation during World War II were <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> operations that were undertaken by German Axis forces in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. In keeping with German signals practice since 1942, the term "communication intelligence" () had been used when intercept units were assigned to observe both enemy "radio and wire" communication. When the observation of only enemy "radio" communication was undertaken, the term "radio intelligence" (). The term "intercept service" () was also used up until 1942.

Introduction.
Towards the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, about 12000 troopers of the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a> were engaged in intercepting the radio traffic of an increasingly powerful adversary. With the decline of the information gained by <a href="Military%20intelligence">intelligence</a> through <a href="Aerial%20reconnaissance">aerial observation</a>, <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> interrogations, and reports from enemy agents, communication intelligence became increasingly important. As a result of communication intelligence, German commanders were better informed about the enemy and his intentions than in any previous war. At the same time that this form of electronic warfare was being waged in World War II, there was another aspect which also gained steadily in importance, namely the more technical high frequency war between opposing <a href="Radar">Radar</a> systems. This consisted of the use of <a href="Microwave%20transmission">Microwave transmission</a> for the location and recognition of enemy units in the air and on the sea, and the adoption of defensive measures against them, especially in air and submarine warfare. A third aspect of this electronic warfare, was the "radio broadcasters war", in which <a href="British%20propaganda%20during%20World%20War%20II">propaganda</a> against Germany, in which propaganda experts tried to influence, by means of foreign language broadcasts over increasingly powerful transmitters.

All three aspects of this modern "cold war of the air waves" were carried on constantly even when the guns were silent.

Radio Intelligence Operations.
In addition to the intelligence gained from interception of routine radio traffic in peacetime and the activity intercepted during maneuvers, the political and military events which preceded <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> offered abundant material for interception. The reason for this was the increased traffic between nation states and the larger number of messages, transmitted by communications equipment in an evolving field. During this period, the German signals intelligence organizations and the specialists employed therein gathered an enormous amount of information.

The activities of the Reichswehr intercept service from 1933 to 1939 centred around the various international crises that arose.

Austrian Revolt of 1934.
In 1934, at the time of the Austrian <a href="Austrian%20Civil%20War">revolt</a>, Munich was given the task of monitoring all <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n communications traffic including internal communications. In its earliest stage, the monitoring and capture of intercepts was intended only to thoroughly acquaint the <a href="Reichswehr">Reichswehr</a> cipher bureau personnel with Austrian traffic. However, after the revolt began, warrants for the arrest of political offenders appeared in the <a href="customs">customs</a> and <a href="police">police</a> traffic, thus giving the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> information concerning the fate of its partisans across the border. At the same time, the intercept service monitored Italian communications and through its discovery that the Italians were massing a multitude of <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> at the <a href="Brenner%20pass">Brenner pass</a> brought about the timely withdrawal of Germany from the affair.

Occupation of the Rhineland 1935.
Ever since 1930, the <a href="Munich">Munich</a> and <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> intercept stations were monitoring French traffic, during the summer months, at the time of the <a href="Allied%20occupation%20of%20the%20Rhineland%23French%20forces">occupation of the Rhineland</a>, for suitable intercept sites for use against France. The participants were disguised as workmen and armed with <a href="passports">passports</a>. After sites had been selected, the construction work was completed with the help of trustworthy civilians. Several weeks before the <a href="Remilitarization%20of%20the%20Rhineland">Remilitarization of the Rhineland</a>, an intensive monitoring of France was ordered. As the result of the intelligence, German troops marched in without fear of reprisal.

The Abyssinian War 1933-1936.
From 1933 to 1935, during the period of the <a href="Second%20Italo-Ethiopian%20War">Abyssinian War</a>, intercept stations of the Army High Command, monitored Italian traffic without cessation. During the Abyssinian War, the intercept stations and the Wehrmacht cipher bureau were able to follow all Italian traffic very closely because of one exception, it was in possession of all Italian codes. The strength, organization, and locations of the Italian peace-time army was accurately known, and it was possible to keep abreast of the movements of each unit. Italian officers, from Commander-in-Chief, <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, down to the youngest <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>. Locations, strength, and armament of the Italian Colonial Troops were also known in detail.

The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939.
From 1936 to 1939, the Munich and Stuttgart intercept stations monitored both factions during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. To facilitate this task, and advanced intercept station was created on the <a href="Wendelstein%2C%20Bavaria">Wendelstein</a> in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. From the traffic intercepted, it was realized that intercept sites in Spain itself, were indispensable, if an impressive job were to be done. Accordingly, when the Legion Condor was founded, a signals intelligence company was added to it, with personnel count eventually reaching approximately 230 men. With the company, Signals Intelligence took to the field for the first time. However, a mistake was made in placing the unit in the hands of officers, who were opposed to the very existence of the signals intelligence apparatus, and who had an unfavourable effect on the work. In spite of this, the unit quick assumed its role as the most important instrument of intelligence to the Legion Command, the more so because the signal procedures of the Communists was considered very primitive.

The monitoring of the Spanish Civil War was an opportunity to conduct a "war by proxy" against the Soviet Union, as the Republican Armies communications equipment was of mostly soviet in origin and design.

Czechoslovakia 1938.
For a long time during the interwar period, the entire radio net traffic of <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> was considered easy to intercept and evaluate. It was observed by fixed listening posts and intercept companies in <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a> and <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and subsequently also by stations in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. Towards the end of May 1938, one of the key radio stations in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, attached to the Czechoslovakia <a href="War%20Ministry">War Ministry</a>, suddenly transmitted a brief unusual message, which was believed to be an order for mobilization. This message was immediately followed by changed in the radio traffic characterized by the use of new <a href="frequency">frequencies</a> and <a href="call%20sign">call sign</a>s, and by regrouping of radio nets which had been prepared for the event of mobilization. During the next few days, very primitive, simple radio nets appeared along the border and then disappeared again when the tension was relax, whereupon the entire radio net resumed its original characteristics. The Intercept Control Station was able to report that the mobilization order had been revoked.

During the middle of 1938, the Czechoslovakia war ministry repeated the same procedure as happened in Spring 1938. Again another announcement for mobilization order was repeated by radio and within a few minutes the message was forwarded to Berlin. The same primitive radio nets appeared along the border with almost the same call signs on the same radio frequencies.

German signal intelligence considered it a practical object lesson in how to run an inept radio operation. The reason for the two partial mobilizations by Czechoslovakia. The Professor of History, <a href="Igor%20Luke%C5%A1">Igor Lukeš</a>, who has studied this event at length, states that it was a possible deception operation by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, where disinformation was fed to the Czechoslovakia, causing the partial mobilization. The reason that <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> feared not war but a diplomatic arrangement between the western allies and Hitler leading to the collapse of Czechoslovakia. Certainly at that time Hitler had no plans to invade Czechoslovakia, although it seems the mobilization seemed to cause a change of mind.

Polish Campaign 1939.
Polish radio communications were well known to the Intercept Control Station, as a result of long observation during the interwar period, and were intercepted from points in Silesia and <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a>. During the period in the summer of 1939, the intercept service and cipher bureau observed not only the regular traffic but a large number of field messages which increased daily and was far out of proportion to the known organization and radio equipment possessed by the <a href="Polish%20Armed%20Forces%23World%20War%20II">Polish Army</a>. As was later confirmed after the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">Invasion of Poland</a> in September 1939, the purpose of this was to camouflage Polish radio communications by using three call signs and three frequencies for each station. Intelligence officers engaged in the evaluation of traffic and D/F data were unable to derive any detailed tactical results from the intercepted messages. It was impossible for officers to determine if polish efforts to disguise their efforts were to simulate stronger forces than they possessed. In any case, the lack of radio silence in the assembly area was a grave mistake.

In 1939, German intercept was still mostly immobile. Intercept companies were mostly motorized bu there was no close cooperation between them, and the army group and HQ. The Polish radio communication system failed after the second day of the campaign, when it attempted to take the place of the wire landlines destroyed by bombing. Perhaps as a result of the intercept successes they had achieved in the 1920s, they had restricted peacetime radio activity to a minimum. As soon as they ramped up radio communications, their communication nets collapsed completely. It was unable to keep pace with the Polish retreat, and were seized by a kind of panic. Clear-text messages revealed that some stations would not transmit, lest they be bombed. The lack of information meant that the leading source of information regarding the situation became the German <a href="Wehrmachtbericht">OKW communique</a> () This mistake was correct by the OKW in 1940.

A Commander of Intercept Troops East () was left in occupied Poland to continue monitoring the Soviet Union from the intercept posts in <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>/<a href="Zelenogradsk">Cranz</a> and <a href="Strzegom">Striegau</a> with the 3rd/7 and 3rd/18 intercept companies.

Soviet Union 1939-1940.
After the conclusion of the Polish Campaign, the intercept company FAK 610 (<a href="Signal%20Intelligence%20Regiment%20%28KONA%29">KONA 6</a>), stationed in <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galacia</a> region, in the <a href="Sanok">Sanok</a>-<a href="Jaros%C5%82aw">Jaroslav</a>-<a href="Sandomierz">Sandomir</a> area was charged with intercepting radio traffic from the officially friendly <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> units, in eastern Poland, while the Soviet Union was undertaking the invasion of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>.

Using their previous experience had provided the personnel of the unit with excellent training that enabled them to become rapidly skilled in this new types of work. The intercept company was not engaged in <a href="cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a> but solely on the basis of D/F reports and evaluation of traffic intercepts handled by the numerous stations, the staff were able to deduce that a large number of units were in the area, but had no way to determine their organizational structure or Order of Battle. All that could be determined was whether the units belonged to the army, air force, or the NKVD, whose radio intercepts were distinguished by a different call sign, than that used by the regular armed forces. For several months during the period of regrouping, everything was in a state of flux. The soviet radio traffic was considered well organized and efficiently handled. Then the company intercepted messages from areas which were not actually assigned to it. When the USSR occupied the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic states</a> of <a href="Estonia%23Soviet%20occupation">occupied</a> Estonia, <a href="Soviet%20occupation%20of%20Latvia%20in%201940">Latvia</a> and <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> (<a href="Occupation%20of%20the%20Baltic%20states">Occupation of the Baltic states</a>) and when they subsequently attacked <a href="Winter%20War">Finland</a>, their <a href="Shortwave%20radio">Shortwave radio</a> transmissions from those areas were very well received by FAK 610 in southern Galicia, even better in areas further north. This was considered a discovery of great technical importance for the German intercept service. It could not have been arrived at by simple calculation, since it resulted from physical conditions.

A large number of messages were received from the Baltic states and the Finish <a href="Theater%20%28warfare%29">theatre</a> of war, so that in the final stages of evaluation it was possible to determine the Soviet <a href="order%20of%20battle">order of battle</a>. At <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> size, withdrawal was ascertained on the basis of data including numbers, names of officers and place names. Subsequently, the same units, with identifiable turned up on the Finnish front on easily identified locations, and were able to be tracked at other locations, e.g. <a href="Eastern%20Poland">Eastern Poland</a>. Some units vanished, which indicated they had transferred to the interior of Soviet Russia.

The radio communication of the Soviet Army in 1939-1940 was efficient and secure under peacetime conditions, but during war time, it offered weak spots to enemy intercept services and was a source of excellent information for the German intelligence service.

German Campaign in the Balkans.
The <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a> organization for mobile warfare was still incomplete; results were jeopardized at first by the great distances between intercept stations and the target areas, and later by defective signal communication which delayed the work of evaluation.

The Commander of Intercept Troops Southeast, whose HQ, that was a <a href="regiment">regiment</a>, was located to the east of <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> in <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, was responsible to <a href="Field%20marshal">Field marshal</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20List">Wilhelm List</a>, the <a href="12th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">12th Army</a> commander. He was responsible for two fixed intercept stations in <a href="Graz">Graz</a> and <a href="Tulln%20an%20der%20Donau">Tulln an der Donau</a> and two intercept companies. His sphere of action comprised the entire <a href="Balkans">Balkan Peninsula</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and the British forces in Greece and the Middle East.

Until late in 1940, radio interception against Greece and the Near East was carried out only as a secondary task with insufficient resources by the Tulln station. The great distances, for instance, some 780 miles between <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and <a href="Athens">Athens</a> and the 1440 miles between Vienna and <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, were a significant factor, whereas, for comparison, radio intercept operations between Münster and London is only 312 miles. The value of the results was in inverse proportion to the distances involved.

In the beginning of 1941, when it was planned to enlarge the intercept service against Greece, especially after the landing of British Forces, described above, except for the <a href="Graz">Graz</a> station, were transferred to Romania. In February 1941, Major <a href="Fritz%20Boetzel">Fritz Boetzel</a>, the Commander of Intercept Troops, Southeast and his evaluation centre were stationed in Bucharest. From a location near this city, the "Tulln station" covered Greece, giving its main communication requirements to intercepting British communications emanating from there and the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. One of the intercept companies also located in the vicinity of Bucharest observed <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> in addition to British radio traffic in Greece. The other intercept company, located in <a href="Bac%C4%83u">Bacău</a>, (150 miles north of Bucharest) has to carry out intercept operations against <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Soviet Russia</a> and the Romanian police, whereas the Graz station, whose main attention was directed at Yugoslavia and Italy, intercepted traffic of the Romanian and <a href="Rend%C5%91rs%C3%A9g">Hungarian police</a>.

Before the outbreak of hostilities in the Balkans, the Germans detected Greek army units in the northeastern corner of the country, <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> operations around <a href="Patras">Patras</a> and Athens, and British ground forces in <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>. The also intercepted messages from the British border troops in the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Transjordan">Emirate of Transjordan</a>.

After the entry of German troops into <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Bulgaria%20during%20World%20War%20II%23Axis%20Powers%20.281941.E2.80.931944.29">Bulgarian</a>, the above units, except the Graz station was transferred to that county, and the intercept company in Bacau also covered Greece. The results were similar to those formerly obtained. It was not yet possible, however to break Greek ciphers, because of an insufficient number of intercepted messages, so the German units had to be content with traffic analysis. It was possible to break the British field cipher in <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a> though.

Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Attack</a> upon Greece on 6th April 1941, brisk radio traffic was intercepted and evaluated. The disposition of Greek forces in northern Greece was revealed and could be traced. West of the River <a href="Vardar">Vardar</a> in the British Expeditionary Force sector, the German intercept units detected three radio nets comprising fourteen stations, representing an armored unit northeast of <a href="Veria">Veria</a>, which was subsequently transferred to the area south of <a href="Vevi">Vevi</a>, a British division north of <a href="Katerini">Katerini</a> and another division west of <a href="Demetrios">Demetrios</a>. It was confirmed that these forces has remained for several days in the areas reported. On 8th April 1941, the following British message in clear text was repeatedly read:

In the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>, the intercept units followed the movement of a British regiment from Palestine to Egypt. Th first indication of this was a message of a <a href="Paymaster">Paymaster</a> in the British military government ordering a certain agency to be particularly careful to prevent the departing regiment from taking any <a href="Filing%20cabinet">Filing cabinet</a>s along with them, since there were needed by the military government office. Thereafter, the regiments movements could be clearly traced.

Radio intelligence against Yugoslavia produced an excellent picture of enemy positions. Three (temporary groupings of army-sized units, where the command of one of its composite units formed the grouping's command structure) and one <a href="corps">corps</a> from each were located near <a href="Ni%C5%A1">Niš</a>, <a href="Skopje">Skopje</a> and <a href="Stip">Stip</a> and later at <a href="Veles">Veles</a>.

Very little radio traffic was heard in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. By the middle of April 1941, German radio intelligence located Greek troop units between the River <a href="Haliacmon">Haliacmon</a> and the <a href="Albania">Albania</a>n border, and also followed the withdrawal of a British armored unit from the vicinity of <a href="Vevi">Vevi</a> to the <a href="Kozani">Kozani</a> area, and subsequently to Eleftochorion and subsequent to <a href="Trikala">Trikala</a>. The withdrawal of British <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">divisions</a> and a few days later, further withdrawals to the area of <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a> were observed.

In the middle of April, the Commander of Intercept Troops Southeast moved to the <a href="Salonika">Salonika</a> area with the "Tulln station", elements of the Graz station and one intercept company. The other intercept company was released for service in Russia.

Greek radio traffic diminished rapidly and ended on 21st April 1941. German intercept units continued to follow the traffic of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece%23British%20Expeditionary%20Force">British Expeditionary Force</a> in Greece until it disappeared from the air after the final embarkation in late April 1941. The intercepting of British traffic from <a href="Crete">Crete</a> and the <a href="Aegean%20Islands">Aegean Islands</a> was continued. During subsequent British operations in the <a href="Dodecanese">Dodecanese</a> Islands, for instance the occupation of <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, the enemy often transmitted important situation reports in the clear.

Norway and Denmark 1940.
The mobile operation of an intercept platoon in the in the <a href="Norwegian%20Campaign">Norwegian Campaign</a> in 1940 suffered from all the defects inherent in inadequately prepared improvised operations. A few radio operators were picked from each of six different units in the West, but no translators or cryptanalysts. The equipment was also inadequate. Later, there was no shipping space to move the platoon up in time and close enough to the German operations staff and the enemy area which was to be covered, nor was the platoon given any data or instructions.

In its first operation, which was carried out with the assistance of the Husum fixed intercept stations, the platoon intercepted only coastal defense messages in <a href="Plaintext">Plaintext</a> from <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> concerning ship movements. No army radio traffic was heard. Even these messages ceased on 9th April 1940. Because of the great distance only a few Norwegian coastal stations were heard. Up to 8th April, this traffic was normal, but on the night of 8-9th April, it increased to a point of wild confusion. Normal army radio traffic was observed in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. After the platoon's first move, to <a href="Als%20%28island%29">Als</a> on the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>, Norwegian Army messages were also intercepted, as well as traffic between Swedish and Norwegian radio stations. It was not until 24th April, i.e. eleven days after the operations had commenced, that the intercept platoon was moved up to <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> and thus employed in the vicinity of the German operations staff.

The Norwegian Army stations usually transmitted in <a href="Plaintext">Plaintext</a>. Radio stations traffic in central and southern Norway was intercepted, but few of the messages were of any tactical value.

Radio messages between Great Britain and Norway were more important. The Admiralty station transmitted encrypted orders to the naval officers in the command of the strategic towns of <a href="Harstad%20%28town%29">Harstadt</a>, <a href="%C3%85ndalsnes">Åndalsnes</a> and <a href="%C3%85lesund">Ålesund</a>. Although these messages could not be solved, they provided clues to the most important debarkation ports of the British Expeditionary Force. In particular, they confirmed the landings near Harsdadt, which had hitherto been merely a matter of conjecture.

Germany intercepted the field messages of the British units which were advancing from the <a href="%C3%85ndalsnes">Åndalsnes</a> area by way of <a href="Domb%C3%A5s">Dombås</a>, <a href="Otta%2C%20Norway">Otta</a>, <a href="Hamar">Hamar</a> to <a href="Lillehammer">Lillehammer</a> in the direction of <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>. The used code names for all their <a href="Military%20call%20sign">call signs</a> and signatures. The messages themselves could not be solved. However, since their code names were learned after a short time from captured documents, the <a href="Command%20hierarchy">Chain of Command</a> and enabling Germany to clearly recognize the composition of units.

<a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> radio stations were frequently heard transmitting to Norwegian stations, and handled mostly official and business messages. Norwegian radio messages were then relayed from Sweden to Great Britain.

When in the middle of May, a unit of German command staff was transferred to the city of <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>, with an intercept platoon, and found especially favourable receiving conditions near the city, which was approximately 1500 feet above sea level. A large Norwegian radio net regularly transmitted air reconnaissance reports, information on the composition and commitment to mobilization of the Norwegian 7th Division, a second field <a href="Brigade">Brigade</a> that was formed by General <a href="Carl%20Gustav%20Fleischer">Carl Gustav Fleischer</a> to fight in northern Norway against the invading Germans.

Two radio stations continued to operate east of the island of <a href="Vega%2C%20Norway">Vega</a> in the rear of the German <a href="2nd%20Mountain%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">2nd Mountain Division</a>, which was advancing to relieve <a href="Narvik">Narvik</a>, until they were knocked out as the results of intercepts. The majority of the radio stations which were observed were in the Narvik area, or to the north of the city. The <a href="Alta%20Battalion">Alta Battalion</a> was often mentioned as being in action. Additional stations of other radio nets were identified in <a href="Kirkenes">Kirkenes</a>, <a href="Vard%C3%B8">Vardø</a>, Harstadt, <a href="Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a>, <a href="Alta%2C%20Norway">Alta</a> and <a href="Honningsv%C3%A5g">Honningsvåg</a>. At the end of hostilities on 9th June, all Norwegian traffic stopped within a few hours. Messages from British and French units were also picked up, as well as traffic from the <a href="Poland">Polish</a> mountain units. For the purpose of avoiding confusion with internal French traffic, a temporary teletype line to the commander of the German intercept troops in France was created, so that any radio transmissions from France would be recognized and tuned out.

In order to furnish the <a href="Kampfgruppe">Kampfgruppe</a> Dietl in Narvik with radio intelligence of a type specific for local importance without loss of time, the intercept platoon was ordered to organize a short-range intelligence section, but as a result of the development of the situation, this section never saw actions. Instead, intercepts of interest to Kampfgruppe Dietl were forwarded to it through <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> by telephone and <a href="Teleprinter">teletype</a>. During the 7th and 8th of June all non-Norwegian traffic stopped, which confirmed the withdrawal of the Allies from Narvik.

The traffic between Great Britain and Norway, which has already been intercepted near <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, was now observed in larger volumes from <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>. Most of the traffic was between <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> (possibly <a href="Prestwick">Prestwick</a>) and <a href="Bod%C3%B8">Bodø</a> or <a href="Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a>. The volumes of messages was very large, with the average word count of 200 letters. Every evening the Germans intercepted situation reports of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Norway%29">Norwegian High Command</a> in Tromsø, orders from the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, mine warnings, SOS calls, government messages to England and Frances, personal messages from <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">King Haakon</a> to <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a> and <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands</a>, and reports of the <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> news correspondents attached to Norwegian units.

On the 25th May, the radio station at <a href="Bod%C3%B8">Bodø</a> was destroyed by German bombers. Scotland called Bodø for twelve hours in vain. Messages then transmitted by the <a href="Vads%C3%B8">Vadsø</a> radio station were immediately intercepted. Germany contained to intercept the traffic between Norway, Sweden and Great Britain.

Both the Trondheim station and the intercept platoon radioed a demand for surrender to the Norwegian High Command in Tromsø. After its acceptance these radio channels were kept in operation until the middle of June 1940, when the platoon was disbanded and its personnel returned to their former units on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Western Front</a>.

British radio traffic was, as usual, well disciplined and offered few opportunities to German radio intelligence intercept. For this reason the intercept platoon endeavoured to work on as broad a scale as large as possible and to intercept a large number of messages, and to probe for soft spots. Since it lacked special equipment and suitable personnel, the British ciphers could not be solved. Therefore, clear-text messages or code names and <a href="traffic%20analysis">traffic analysis</a> had to suffice as source material. Traffic evaluation was based therefore, on procedural aspects of enemy radio operations.

Today it appears incomprehensible why Great Britain seriously impaired the value of well-disciplined radio organization and their excellent ciphers by transmitting call signs and signatures in the clear. Operating mistakes of that kind provided valuable information to the German intercept services, although it was poorly trained and insufficiently prepared. Subsequent experience on other battlefields showed that more extensive and intelligent efforts on the German side would have resulted in even more opportunities for breaking British ciphers.

British-Norwegian radio traffic was typical of the deficiencies which develop during a coalition with a weaker ally. It was carried on according to Norwegian standards and offered a wealth of information to German communication intelligence. The British and Norwegians were apparently unable to use a common <a href="cipher">cipher</a>. On the other hand, the operating efficiency of British radio communications procedures was high. The Norwegian personnel appeared to have been recruited from the ranks of professional radio operators.

At this point it should be repeated that the use of clear-text messages and code names should be avoided as a matter of principle. If code names were considered indispensable, they should have been frequently changed. A decisive transmission error prominent in traffic between the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> and Norway was the use of call signs in the clear as listed in the <a href="Bern%20Table%20of%20Call%20Signs">Bern Table of Call Signs</a>. By this means alone it was possible to recognise and identify these messages after only a few minutes of listening.

By way of summary, it can be stated that during the Norwegian Campaign, British radio operators did not at all times observe the security measures which would have protected them from interception and evaluation by German intelligence. The results achieved by German radio intelligence during this campaign were quite modest, and understandably so, in view of the shortage of equipment and personnel, which consisted of only one first lieutenant () and 24 enlisted men.

Campaign in the West 1940.
Prior to the beginning of the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29%23Battles%20for%20Luxembourg.2C%20the%20Netherlands.2C%20Belgium%20and%20France">Western Campaign</a> on 10th May 1940, the operations and command channel structure of German radio intelligence was divided into four chronological phases, as illustrated in Charts 3, a-d.

Up to January 1940, the fixed intercept stations were under direct <a href="Oberkommando%20des%20Heeres">OKH</a> jurisdiction with regard to long-range intelligence covering France, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and Great Britain. Following instructions from OKH, Intercept Evaluation Centre #3 , operating from <a href="Army%20Group%203%20%28Germany%29">Army Group 3</a> HQ in <a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main">Frankfurt am Main</a>, which was then responsible for operations in the West, ordered the mobile intercept companies to intercept Belgium and French traffic emanating from the border region. The intercept companies which became available for reassignment at the end of the Polish campaign were sent to the west.
For operations, the HQ of intercept troops with each army group was assigned one evaluation centre (NAAS) and two intercept companies; the fixed intercept station at <a href="Euskirchen">Euskirchen</a> had been temporarily motorized as an intercept company. The <a href="M%C3%BCnster">Münster</a> and <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> fixed intercept stations continued to co-operate with the commanders of intercept troops (the Münster station with Army Group B, and the Stuttgart station with <a href="Army%20Group%20C">Army Group C</a>). It was intended to move them forward as soon as possible.

Prior to the start of major operation the information obtained by radio intelligence from the northern sector held by the British and French forces was not particularly valuable because of the great distance involved, for instance 210 miles between <a href="Lille">Lille</a> and Münster, and because of its largely technical character. Thus, all intercept units were thoroughly familiar with the French systems as a result of the many messages which had been copied. The intercept units of <a href="Army%20Group%20B">Army Group B</a> were also familiar with the <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> and <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> systems. As early as December 1939, Germany <a href="cryptanalysis">decoded</a> a special cryptographic system used by French command in radio messages to the armies and military district headquarters. It has been used contrary to regulations prior to the start of the war on September 1939. Germany was able to solve this system due to the radio station guilty of the violation, which was later reprimanded and thereupon repeated the same messages in the proper system. Their contents revealed a certain amount of organizational information, for example, the fact that the French <a href="2nd%20Light%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28France%29">2nd Light Cavalry Division</a> and 3rd Cavalry Division had been reorganized into the <a href="1st%20Armored%20Division%20%28France%29">1st Armored Division</a> and 2nd Armored Division and were due to move into their assembly area northeast of <a href="Paris">Paris</a> by 1st January 1940. However, this type of incomplete information could generally be considered only as a supplement to and confirmation of other intelligence concerning the Allies. It was not possible to deduce the Allies order of battle from radio intelligence alone.

Nevertheless, Germany could identify the probable concentration areas of the French and British armies from the practice messages sent by armthe field radio stations, although the boundaries of <a href="army%20group">army group</a>s, <a href="Army">armies</a>, <a href="corps">corps</a> and <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> could not be established with any certainty. Greater clarity prevailed about the the fortified area behind the <a href="Maginot%20Line">Maginot Line</a> in the south. Allies forces stationed near the Franco-Swiss and Franco-Italian borders were not observed according to any regular plan. Spot-check intercepting failed to pick up the French <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28France%29">Tenth Army</a> in the location were it was presumed to be by the German command. However, radio intelligence did indicate the presence of the French <a href="Sixth%20Army%20%28France%29">Sixth Army</a>.

Intercepted radio messages from the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> enabled Germany to conclude that the following units had been transferred to the Continent:


As well as several divisions of the second and third waves, the exact number and numerical designations of which could not be ascertained.

The intercepted Belgian and Dutch messages permitted only one conclusion, namely their preparatory were directed against Germany exclusively. Belgian traffic was characterized by good radio discipline, whereas the Dutch were more careless.

The missions which OKH gave to the army group HQ concerning radio intelligence were merely supplemented by the latter. Army Group B and Army Group A were requested to give priority to intelligence pertaining to the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> as well as the the French 1st and 7th Armies. Special value was attached to ascertaining at an early date whether the French <a href="Seventh%20Army%20%28France%29">Seventh Army</a> would immediately march into <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>.

At first the fixed intercept stations were ordered to cover the more remote areas beyond the French border. The <a href="Oberkommando%20des%20Heeres">Oberkommando des Heeres</a> was guided by the idea of retaining most of the long-range intelligence in its own hands, and of having the intercept companies concentrate more on short range intelligence. To be sure, this intention was not clearly was not clearly expressed in the orders. It also soon became evident that the two fixed intercept stations did not suffice for long range intelligence.

During the first few weeks the main efforts of radio intelligence were concentrated on the area facing Army Group B.

Immediately after the opening of hostilities, Dutch and Belgian radio traffic increased suddenly in this area. From <a href="Plain%20text">Plain text</a> messages sent by the <a href="III%20Corps%20%28Netherlands%29">III Corps Netherlands</a> close to <a href="%27s-Hertogenbosch">'s-Hertogenbosch</a>, which were supplemented by plain text radio reports from the <a href="Dutch%20II%20Corps">Dutch II Corps</a> consisting of the <a href="Dutch%202nd%20Infantry%20Division">Dutch 2nd Infantry Division</a> and <a href="Dutch%204th%20Infantry%20Division">Dutch 4th Infantry Division</a> near <a href="Rhenen">Rhenen</a> at the <a href="Grebbe%20line">Grebbe line</a>, Germany learned on the 11th May that the Allies had decided to withdraw into "Fortress Holland" (<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Battle of the Netherlands</a>). Germany also learned from intercepted traffic from Belgian, which was supplemented by plain-text messages from the Belgian <a href="6th%20Infantry%20Division">6th Infantry Division</a> that was part of the <a href="Belgian%20II%20Corps">Belgian II Corps</a> near <a href="Beringen%2C%20Belgium">Beringen</a> that the Belgians intended to offer strong resistance behind the <a href="Albert%20Canal">Albert Canal</a>.

On 10 and 11 May, French radio traffic in the <a href="Poperinge">Poperinge</a> - <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a> - <a href="Kortrijk">Kortrijk</a> area. and the British traffic in the <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>, enabled Germany to realize that elements of the French <a href="Seventh%20Army%20%28France%29">Seventh Army</a> and apparently also elements of the British Army had advanced into Belgian territory. Moreover, we were able to deduce from the characteristics that the British <a href="1st%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%20Division">1st Armored Division</a> had moved from <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> to <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a>. As early as 12th May, a message from the HQ station of the French 7th Army was solved which indicated that the latter intended to defend the <a href="Dyle%20%28river%29">River Dyle</a> positions. Direction finding revealed the landing of French units on the former island of <a href="Walcheren">Walcheren</a>.

As the result of the surrender of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Army">Dutch Army</a>, the interception of Dutch radio traffic would be discontinued on the 15th May.
During the battle for the Dyle positions, the Germans picked up the command nets of the French First and Seventh Armies, whose HQs were plotted on <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a> and <a href="Valenciennes">Valenciennes</a> on the 17th May, although from the radio messages transmitted within these nets to the subordinate corps and divisions, it was possible to determine only the total number and not the designations of these units. Only on a few occasions could such designations be picked up from messages carelessly radioed in the clear, e.g. when the French 54th and 72nd Divisions were detected on 19th May as belonging to the same corps in the <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a> - <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> area

It was equally impossible to ascertain the divisional designations within the British Army, the headquarters of which was found to be in <a href="Hazebrouck">Hazebrouck</a> on 23 May. However, by the end of May, the presence of twelve divisions had been traced, which included in addition to the regular divisions, the <a href="56th%20%28London%29%20Infantry%20Division">1st London Division</a>, <a href="12th%20%28Eastern%29%20Division">12th</a>, <a href="23rd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">23rd</a>, <a href="45th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">45th</a>, <a href="50th%20%28Northumbrian%29%20Infantry%20Division">50th</a> and <a href="51st%20%28Highland%29%20Division">51st</a> Divisions.

No more Belgian command radio traffic was observed after 19th May, when the Franco-British forces in the north under General <a href="Gaston%20Billotte">Gaston Billotte</a> were threatened by a double envelopment in the Valenciennes - <a href="Cambrai">Cambrai</a> - <a href="Maubeuge">Maubeuge</a> - <a href="Mons">Mons</a> area. After 22nd May, Germany was able to plot the withdrawal of French and Belgian units from the <a href="Ghent%E2%80%93Terneuzen%20Canal">Ghent Canal</a> and <a href="Scheldt">Scheldt</a> River westward from the Bruges - Ghent - <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a>.

On that day, the British Army HQ established direct contact with the Ministry of War in London, and the French army group commander exchanged a remarkably large number of messages with the French High Command in <a href="Free%20France">Free France</a>. In spite of intensified efforts, Germany were unable to cryptanalyse the Allies ciphers.

Unusually long encrypted messages, likewise unbreakable, from the French First Army headquarters to an unidentified senior staff located south of the <a href="Somme%20%28department%29">Somme</a> suggested that joint action for attempting breakouts was being agreed on by radio. There breakout attempts then actually took place near Valenciennes, <a href="Arras">Arras</a> and <a href="Cambrai">Cambrai</a>. Plain-text messages sent on the 24th May, in which complaints were voiced about the lack of ammunition, rations and fuel, confirmed that the situation within the pocket was becoming critical. On the 25th May, a decrypted message to the British commander at Calais, <a href="Claude%20Nicholson">Claude Nicholson</a>, confirmed the seriousness of the situation. This same message enabled Germany to locate the <a href="5th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">5th Infantry Division</a> together with the French <a href="68th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28France%29">68th Infantry</a>, near <a href="Nieuwpoort%2C%20Belgium">Nieuwpoort</a> and it also indicated the beginning of the evacuation of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> to <a href="England">England</a>.

On the 26th May, intensive direction-finding operations confirmed the concentration of British, French and Belgian forces in the areas including Ghent, Kortrijk, Valenciennes, <a href="Lens%2C%20Pas-de-Calais">Lens</a>, <a href="B%C3%A9thune">Béthune</a>, <a href="Saint-Omer">Saint-Omer</a> and <a href="Gravelines">Gravelines</a>. Outside this area, no more enemy traffic was heard.

After 28th May, approximately the time of the Belgian capitulation, it was no longer possible to distinguish the various radio nets and to observe and evaluate them systematically. Continued direction-finding operations indicated that the encirclement area has been split up into three pockets: a northern one, east of <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a>, from which mostly British traffic was heard; a central pocket, northwest of <a href="Roubaix">Roubaix</a>; and a southern pocket, southeast of <a href="Lille">Lille</a>. Because of the concentration of a great number of transmitters within one narrow area, it was no longer possible to take accurate bearings. The intermingling of different units was reflected by the confusion which was beginning to spread among the radio operators, who no longer felt bound by any rules, all of which resulted in a situation which in German radio terminology is described as a "call sign and wave-length stew".

Conclusions.
An evaluation of the radio traffic during the first phase of the campaign in the west, with the exception of Dutch traffic, which practically disappeared after five days of fighting, lead to the following conclusions:

Chart 4 contains the radio intercept results which had been obtained up to the time when German Army Groups B and A moved into position for their attack across the Somme and Aisne on 4th and 7th June.

For this operation Army Group B, which had left the <a href="Euskirchen">Euskirchen</a> Fixed Intercept Station in northern France to intercept the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>s traffic, was assigned the 56th Intercept Company of Army Group A, which has been stationed near <a href="Le%20Cateau-Cambr%C3%A9sis">Le Cateau-Cambrésis</a>. Army Group A was assigned the 18th Intercept Company, the third to be released from the East. Thus, each army group again had two motorized intercept companies at its disposal: Army Group B having the 26th and 56th Intercept Companies; Army Group A having the 3rd and 18th Intercept Companies; and Army Group C having the 9th and 57th Intercept Companies.

On the 5th June, when Army Group B crossed the <a href="Somme%20%28river%29">River Somme</a>, radio messages were intercepted which indicated that the enemy was concerned about the impending German attack because of insufficient progress has been made in completing the positions between <a href="Fismes">Fismes</a> and <a href="Moselle">Moselle</a>. On the same day British traffic was heard for the last time on the Continent (until 1944) and brigades of the <a href="51st%20%28Highland%29%20Division">51st (Highland) Division</a> were identified. A <a href="plaintext">plaintext</a> intercept, according to which French troops that has escaped to England from the pocket of encircled forces in the north were to be returned to <a href="Cherbourg-Octeville">Cherbourg</a>, was forwarded to the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>, so that the French could be attacked by air.

On the 16th June, the day following Army Group A's crossing of the River <a href="Aisne%20%28river%29">Aisne</a>, the main radio station of the French <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Armed%20Forces%20%28France%29">Ministry of War</a>, which also served the French High Command, closed down and turned over its functions to the main station at <a href="Tours">Tours</a>, which was then assumed to be the new command post of General <a href="Maxime%20Weygand">Maxime Weygand</a>.

Allies radio traffic from the area between the Oise and River <a href="Marne%20%28river%29">Marne</a> had already stopped on the 12th June. On that day, however, messages were intercepted from the French <a href="Fourth%20Army%20%28France%29">Fourth Army</a>, which had long been sought in vain. Germany continued to carry out direction-finding operations in the <a href="Ch%C3%A2lons-en-Champagne">Châlons-en-Champagne</a> area, but no further details could be ascertained.

A radio message intercepted on 13th June, revealed the decision of the French High Command to retreat behind the River <a href="Loire">Loire</a>.

On 15th June, French radio traffic began to show signs of complete disorganization. HQs called each other in vain, blind messages became more frequent; the percentage of <a href="plaintext">plaintext</a> messages rose; various code designations were used, although it must have been realized that they were not secure. The confusion in radio operations pointed to the growing disintegration of French forces. Radio intelligence of the pursuing German army groups had to restrict itself to following the movements of only the senior staff, particularly of the army HQ. This information is shown in Chart 4.

In front of <a href="Army%20Group%20C">Army Group C</a>, the intercept service had kept the area behind the fortified front under surveillance since 10th May. Its mission was chiefly to find out whether, under the stress of the fighting in the north and centre, units of the French 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th Armies were pulled out of their positions and moved to this part of the front.

About three days before the attack, in order to pin down the units along a fortified front, Germany began to transmit fake messages in conjunction with other tactical deceptions in the area of the boundary between the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> <a href="1st%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">1st Army</a> and <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">7th Armies</a>. These measures simulated the traffic of an improvised army consisting of mobile units under the control of three corps HQs. The deceptive messages apparently caused concern, when on 10th May the volume of traffic increased noticeably from the area of the French 3rd and 4th Armies. There was no indications of any weakening of the fortified front until this traffic was discontinued.

Not before 28th May was it clearly established that a mobile division of the French Second Army has been moved out of position and transferred to the west. On the basis of its transmission characteristics, its movements could be followed as far as the <a href="Montdidier%2C%20Somme">Montdidier</a> area. On the other hard, it was impossible to trace the location of the French <a href="Fourth%20Army%20%28France%29">Fourth Army</a>, which on the following day, ceased to transmit from the fortified area. Nor did the radio picture reveal that its sector had been taken over by the adjacent French <a href="Third%20Army%20%28France%29">Third Army</a> and <a href="Fifth%20Army%20%28France%29">Fifth Armies</a>. The withdrawal of the Sixth and Tenth Army HQs, which assumed command behind the lower Somme on 23rd May, was not detected by radio interception, because of the intelligence mission assigned to <a href="Army%20Group%20C">Army Group C</a> had not included coverage of the <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> and <a href="Italy">Italian</a> border. It was not known whether the fixed intercept stations under OKH which were assigned exclusively to <a href="Signal%20Intelligence%20Regiment%20%28KONA%29%23Long%20Range%20Intelligence%20Company">long-range intelligence</a>, obtained any information.

When Army Group C commenced operations on the <a href="Saar%20front">Saar front</a> and crossed the <a href="Upper%20Rhine">Upper Rhine</a>, the intercept companies were given the mission of keeping track of those French units in the intermediate area which were capable of carrying out mobile operations. Along the fortified front the Allies on the whole observed excellent radio discipline, which continued until Germany attacked on the <a href="Marne%E2%80%93Rhine%20Canal">Marne–Rhine Canal</a> ran into the Polish <a href="1st%20Grenadiers%20Division%20%28Poland%29">1st Grenadiers Division</a> and the 2nd Divisions. As a result of the advance of the army on the left of <a href="Army%20Group%20A">Army Group A</a> (Chart 4), the area covered by the three intercept companies was rapidly narrowed down, so that soon the same difficulties were encountered as during the observation of the northern pocket. Here too, the results of radio intelligence were not as effective as those obtained by ground reconnaissance. Nevertheless, it was possible to detect in time, around 15th June, the assembly of French forces near <a href="Vesoul">Vesoul</a> which led to the attempted break-through onto the <a href="Langres%20Plateau">Langres Plateau</a>.

As the encircled area became narrower, there appeared the same demoralization of radio traffic as had been observed in the northern pockets and during the pursuit in the <a href="Loire%20%28department%29">Loire</a>. 

After 20th June, when the French High Command requested an <a href="armistice">armistice</a>, there was no longer any possibility of systematic radio intelligence in front of the three German army groups, as the the Allies no longer possessed a well-defined command structure. 

After the campaign in the West, captured documents, cipher devices and machines, radio equipment of all types, confirmed and supplemented the picture, which Germany had pieced together from the radio traffic of <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="France">France</a> armies, and permitted them to make a fairly accurate evaluation of the security of the Allies systems. Except for their effective cryptographic systems, the Allies had made no attempt to achieve adequate radio secrecy. Under these circumstances the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> intercepted messages did not have to solved, since German radio intelligence could score valuable and strategic successes by carefully observing transmission characteristics on those frequencies employed by the allies and by plotting the location of these units.

German radio intelligence would have been denied these successes if the Allies stations had changed their frequencies, call signs, and operating signals at irregular intervals and if they had observed the cardinal rule of communication secrecy, namely, that one should use radio only in the following cases: 

Colonel <a href="Kunibert%20Randewig">Kunibert Randewig</a> believed that the Allies' radio operations during the campaign in the west gave the impression that these rules has not been taken seriously.

The trade at border haats is permitted to be carried out in Indian Rupees/Bangladesh Taka and on barter basis, and data of such trade is maintained by the Haat Management Committee of the respective border haat. As per data furnished by the concerned State Governments, cash trade equivalent to Indian Rupees 1686.62 lakhs was carried out at the said four border haats in the five year period ending 2015-16.

There are no border haats in operation along the Bhutan and Myanmar borders.

In addition to the four functional border haats, Government of India and Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh have approved six more border haats-two in Tripura at Palbasti and Kamalpur and four in Meghalaya at Bholaganj, Nalikata, Shibbari and Ryngku.

Government of India has also executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Government of the Republic of Union of Myanmar on establishment of border haats along their border.

The border haats aim at promoting the wellbeing of the people dwelling in remote areas across the borders of two countries, by establishing traditional system of marketing the local produce through local markets.

The Trade Division was a division of <a href="Admiralty%20Naval%20Staff">British Admiralty, Naval Staff</a> department that was responsible for all matters in relation to Trade Defence from 1914 until 1928 and then again from 1939-1961.

History.
Before to 1909 responsibility for Trade Protection lay with the Trade Division that was then part of the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Department%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Naval Intelligence Department</a> until August 1909 when following restructuring within that department the division was abolished. In February 1913 discussions took place to enquire about the setting up of a Trade Branch as part of the <a href="Operations%20Division%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Operations Division</a> of the <a href="Admiralty%20War%20Staff">Admiralty War Staff</a>.

Buenos Aires Rowing Club is an <a href="Argentina">Argentine</a> <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> sited in <a href="Tigre%2C%20Buenos%20Aires">Tigre, Buenos Aires</a>, 30-km distance from the <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> autonomous city. Founded in 1873 and originally headquartered in the capital city, BARC is the oldest <a href="rowing%20club">rowing club</a> of Argentina.

Apart from rowing, other sports held by the institution are <a href="canoe%20racing">canoe racing</a>, <a href="association%20football">football</a>, <a href="swimming%20%28sport%29">swimming</a>, <a href="tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="artistic%20gymnastics">artistic gymnastics</a> and <a href="roller%20skating">roller skating</a>.

History.
Background.
<a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29">Rowing</a> was introduced in Argentina by <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> immigrants in the 1870s. A group of enthusiasts joined the <a href="port%20of%20Buenos%20Aires">port of Buenos Aires</a> with <a href="Tigre%2C%20Buenos%20Aires">Tigre</a> (then named "Las Conchas") in about 3 hours. The first rowing clubs were Buenos Aires Rowing Club (established in 1873) and the Club de Regatas La Marina (1876), both located in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">the capital city</a> while the first official <a href="regatta">regatta</a> was held on December 8, 1873, with representatives from different countries taking part of it. President <a href="Domingo%20Sarmiento">Domingo Sarmiento</a> was one of the notable personalities that attended the event.

Despite of being a difficult access place, Tigre had optimal conditions to the practise of rowing. Because of that, the BARC members set a precarious box there to storage their boats to be used on weekends.

The practise of rowing spreaded with the establishment of a third club, Rosario Rowing Club (sited in the <a href="Rosario%2C%20Santa%20Fe">homonymous city</a>) in <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Province">Santa Fe Province</a>, 1887.

The <a href="Yellow%20fever%20in%20Buenos%20Aires">yellow fever epidemic on Buenos Aires</a> and the development of the <a href="rail%20transport%20in%20Argentina">railway network in the country</a> were two factors that substantially influenced rowing clubs originally established in Buenos Aires to set their locations in Tigre, where they soon moved.

Fifteen years after being formed, the British-origin members of BARC separated from the institution to form their own institution, Tigre Boat Club (the first of that district) in 1888. In December 1901, the Argentine Rowing Association ("Asociación Argentina de Remo") is founded, with the six clubs existing by then: Buenos Aires Rowing Club, Club de Regatas La Marina, Tigre Boat Club, Club de Remo Teutonia (founded by the <a href="Germany">German</a> community), Campana Boat Club and <a href="Club%20de%20Regatas%20Bella%20Vista">Club de Regatas Bella Vista</a>.

Consolidation.
On December 6, 1873 (six days after the first regatta was held), the rowers that had took part of it met in the coffeehouse "Gymnasium" sited on Florida and Corrientes Avenue in Buenos Aires with the purpose of establishing a club. Supported by the British Consul in Argentina, they founded the "Buenos Aires Rowing Club" which became the first rowing club in the country. The BARC founder also agreed to accept all the rowing enthusiasts as members, including non-British citizens.

An old ship ("Sunny South") was the first seat of BARC until a neighbor, Leonardo Pereyra, donated a land bordering <a href="Matanza%20River">Matanza River</a> and a wood shack was built there. In 1876 the club built another shack in <a href="Tigre%2C%20Buenos%20Aires">Tigre</a>. In 1885 the club acquired a 1,600 m2 land in the same region where a building would be constructed at a cost of $ 10,000.

In 1895 the seat in Riachuelo moved to Dársena Sur (<a href="La%20Boca">La Boca</a>), where the club remained until 1902 when it moved to a shed given by the Municipality of Buenos Aires that had been formerly used as <a href="slaughterhouse">slaughterhouse</a>.

The main seat in Tigre was inaugurated in 1911. The building was refurbished and expanded in 1913. The main facade was modified to a <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian architecture</a> style.

OMNI Entertainment System

The OMNI Entertainment System was an <a href="Electronics">electronic</a> stand alone game system produced by the MB Electronics division of the <a href="Milton%20Bradley%20Company">Milton Bradley Company</a>, released in 1980.

The system, which played primarily <a href="trivia">trivia</a> question games, used <a href="8-track%20tape">8-track</a> <a href="tape%20cassette">tape cassette</a>s for game cartridges. The game system function was entirely self-contained with its own <a href="Monaural">Monaural</a> speaker and four 2-character <a href="seven%20segment%20display">seven segment display</a>s to show points as well as when the game required input. Up to four Players each interacted with the game with a row of 11 mechanical buttons. Buttons were primarily labelled 0-9 with the final button showing an asterisk-like symbol as an Enter key. Each button was also labelled with colours in rainbow order fading from yellow, to red, to blue, to green, as well as with clusters of letters. Button zero on the left doubled as the "Go" button. The system heavily leveraged the audio format of the 8-track cassette for gameplay, but additionally included binary encoded data containing information on scoring and the correct answers on non-audible channels, making the Omni a programmable system. The system could freely change between playing audio (or reading data) from either the left or right audio channel. The system could also play regular music 8-track cassettes, although not in stereo.

Gameplay.
Each 8-track tape contained four game programs, and the system featured a channel selector dial on the top to chose which program to play. After inserting a tape and adjusting volume via a slider on top next to the channel selector, each player participating would need to press enter. Subsequently, players would be asked questions played back from the tape. Players would then be asked to answer as quickly as possible (indicated by dashes on the display), by selecting the correct colour, number, or spelling out a word and pressing Enter. Players were then awarded typically between 1 and 4 points, with typically the first player receiving an additional point for answering first. The Jeopardy cartridge varied from this scoring system, following along the lines of the <a href="Jeopardy%21%23First_two_rounds">Jeopardy scoring system</a> from the first rounds of a game. After all players answered, the correct answer would be revealed and the points on the displays updated. At the end of the game the winning player would be indicated. Occasional music interludes (such as in the Password Plus game) would occur while the tape played to the correct location to continue gameplay. Occasionally the display of the player with the leading score would also flash.

R v Larsonneur

R v Larsonneur (1933) was a case heard in the Court of Criminal Appeals of <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a> that has been used to illustrate the applicability of "<a href="actus%20reus">actus reus</a>" to <a href="Strict%20liability%20%28criminal%29">strict liability</a> offences.

Facts.
Larsonneur, a French national was given permission to enter the United Kingdom with a number of conditions on her staying. After her arrival, these conditions were changed and she was ordered to leave the United Kingdom before 22 March 1933. She complied with the order and went to the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a>. She was subsequently deported from Ireland and was forced to return to <a href="Holyhead">Holyhead</a> on the 21 April 1933. On arrival, she was arrested and charged with breaching the <a href="Aliens%20Order%201920">Aliens Order 1920</a>, which made it a criminal offence to be found in the United Kingdom.

Appellate decision.
The appellant's lawyer, Marston Garsia, argued that "the mere fact of being found in the United Kingdom after the time of her departure therefrom had expired was not in intself an offence, unless it could be proved in addition that she landed in the United Kingdom in contravention of Art. 1. Here the evidence showed that she had not landed at all, but that she had been landed by a superior force over which she had no control".

<a href="Gordon%20Hewart%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hewart">Lord Hewart</a> CJ dismissed the appeal and sided with the Crown who argued that how Miss Larsonneur got to the United Kingdom "makes no difference at all".

Criticism.
The decision to apply strict liability has attracted critique as it gives rise to criminal liability even when one's actions are involuntary. A similar set of facts occurred in the case of <a href="Winzar%20v%20Chief%20Constable%20of%20Kent">"Winzar v Chief Constable of Kent"</a> (1983).

Litchfield County Jail

The 1812 Litchfield County Jail is a former correctional facility in <a href="Litchfield%2C%20Connecticut">Litchfield, Connecticut</a>. It is the town's oldest public building and a former jail.

History.
The facility, controlled by the Connecticut state government, historically held inmates convicted of minor offenses, and it had a capacity of 120 prisoners. Bill Ryan of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that Litchfield Jail "is part of the lore of Litchfield" and that "For generations, the reputation of the jail was that of a country club of penal institutions where the living was positively easy."

The prison held British people during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. In the early 20th century an addition was built joining Litchfield Jail to the First National Bank of Litchfield, an 1816 structure.

In a period before the 1990s the state began allowing violent prisoners into the facility, and it reached capacity. A prisoner escaped the prison, stabbed a guard, and held a man from the State of New York as a hostage, so the state government removed the violent prisoners and made it a drug treatment center for male inmates in 1992. The prisoner capacity was reduced to 30. <a href="Governor%20of%20Connecticut">Governor of Connecticut</a> <a href="Lowell%20P.%20Weicker%20Jr.">Lowell P. Weicker Jr.</a> ordered the facility closed for financial reasons in 1993.

It was converted into the McAuliffe Manor, a substance abuse treatment center for women operated by Naugatuck Valley HELP Inc., holding women who were convicted of drug-related crimes who would have otherwise been sent to Connecticut state prisons. In 2009 the contract between Naugatuck Valley HELP Inc. and the state expired, leading to the closure of McAuliffe Manor.

In 2010 the state government put the jail on the market. The municipal government refused multiple offers to take the former jail for free on the grounds of the costs and potential risks of owning the facility. In 2013 the state government sold the facility for $130,000 to Russell Barton, a businessperson and real estate investor from the area.

<doc id="54778935" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54778935" title="Our Lady of Consolation">
Our Lady of Consolation

Starting in the 2nd century, Catholics venerated Mary as Our Lady of Consolation, one of her earliest titles of honor. The title of Our Lady of Consolation, or Mary, Consoler of the Afflicted, comes from the Latin "Consolatrix Afflictorum". It is found in the <a href="Litany%20of%20Loreto">Litany of Loreto</a>.

Augustinians.
The origin of this invocation is derived from the Augustinian monks who propagated this particular devotion. In 1436 the Confraternity of the Holy Cincture of Our Lady of Consolation was founded in Bologna, Italy. It was based on an Augustinian tradition which hold that <a href="Saint%20Monica">Saint Monica</a> in the fourth century, was distraught with anxiety for her wayward son, Augustine, and that Mary gave her a sash which the Virgin wore, with the assurance that whoever wore this belt would receive her special consolation and protection. Along with Augustine, and Monica, Our Lady of Consolation is one of the three patrons of the Augustinians. The "Augustinian Rosary" is sometimes called the "Corona (or Crown) of Our Mother of Consolation".

In the 1700s members of the Augustinian Order introduced devotion to Our Lady of Consolation to the island of Malta. On December 1, 1722 the Prior General of the Augustinian Order Fr Thomas Cervioni issued the Decree for the erection of the Confraternity of Our Lady of Consolation in the church of St Mark, run by the Augustinians at Rabat, although the devotion had been practiced for some time before. By this time the custom of asking for the final blessing before death in the name of Our Lady of Consolation was very popular, and the monks were given a dispensation to leave the monastery at any time to confer it. Processions in Our Lady's honor were suspended during the French occupation of 1798 to discourage the gathering of crowds. The feast day is celebrated on the last Sunday of October with pyrotechnic displays by Our Lady of Consolation Fireworks Factory.

Turin.
An ancient story relates St <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Vercelli">Eusebius of Vercelli</a> brought back an icon of Our Lady of Consolation when he was returning from exile in Egypt in 363. This icon was presented to the city of Turin. Later St Maximus, Bishop of Turin, established a small shrine to house the icon in a church dedicated to St Andrew. The icon became the object of great veneration, and the church became the <a href="Santuario%20della%20Consolata">Santuario della Consolata</a>. <a href="Giuseppe%20Allamano">Giuseppe Allamano</a>, rector of the Santuario della Consolata founded the <a href="Consolata%20Missionaries">Consolata Missionaries</a> in 1902; they brought to devotion to Africa. At the age of nineteen <a href="Joseph%20Marello">Joseph Marello</a> of Turin contracted typhus. He attributed his recovery to Our Lady of Consolation and went on to found the <a href="Oblates%20of%20St.%20Joseph">Oblates of St. Joseph</a>.

There are several versions of the image of Our Lady of Consolation. The original one is in Turin at the <a href="Santuario%20della%20Consolata">Santuario della Consolata</a>. A star on her shoulder is characteristic of almost all the images. The traditional depiction of Our Mother of Consolation in Augustinian houses shows Mary holding the child Jesus on her lap. Jesus and Mary both hold the Augustinian cincture in their hands.

In France the dioceses of Vannes, Valence, Montpelier, Laval, Nantes, Périgueux, Tours and many others, possessed churches or chapels dedicated to Mary under this title. In 1652, <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20X">Pope Innocent X</a> encouraged devotion to Our Lady of Consolation by establishing a <a href="confraternity">confraternity</a>.

Luxembourg.
The cult of Our Lady of Luxembourg, Comforter of the Afflicted, was initiated by the Jesuits in 1624 and led to the election of Our Lady as the protectress of the City in 1666 and of the Duchy in 1678. After the destruction of the old pilgrimage chapel at the time of the French Revolution, the statue of Our Lady of Luxembourg was moved to St. Peter church, today's Cathedral in Luxembourg City. Statues depicting her can be found in niches in buildings throughout the city of Luxembourg. From there the devotion was adopted by the English <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Benedict">Benedictine</a> nuns of <a href="Cambrai">Cambrai</a>.

United States.
Immigrants from Luxembourg transposed the cult of Our Lady of Consolation to the United States.

Germany.
Another center of veneration and pilgrimage, which also adopted Our Lady, Comforter of the Afflicted is Kevaeler in Germany, not far from the Dutch border. In 1642 a copperplate engraving, representing Our Lady of Luxembourg, was installed in a sanctuary erected the same year. It is one of the best visited Catholic pilgrimage locations in north-western Europe. <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> visited in 1987.

England.
There is a shrine of Our Lady of Consolation in West Grinstead, in the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton in England. The Shrine Church dates from 1876 and is the first Shrine in honour of Mary to be established in England since before the Reformation. There was in the Church of St. John the Baptist at Perth, an altar inscribed to "St. Mary of Consolation".

With the approval of the Archbishop of Turin in northern Italy, the new church was affiliated to the original sanctuary of Our Lady of Consolation, and a painting, closely resembling the miraculous Shrine Painting in the <a href="Santuario%20della%20Consolata">Santuario della Consolata</a> of Turin, enriched with similar indulgences and privileges, was brought to West Grinstead. The Shrine Statue was <a href="Canonical%20coronation">canonically crowned</a> by the Papal Delegate, Bishop Butt, on behalf of <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a>, in July 1893.

The Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Consolación is located in Táriba, Venezuela. The Augustinian church of Our Mother of Consolation in the Shiroyama district of Nagasaki is also named in her honor.

Feast day.
The feast of Our Lady of Consolation is one of the solemnities not inscribed in the General Roman Calendar, but which are observed in particular places, regions, churches or religious institutes. Augustinians observe September 4; the Benedictines July 5.

The popular girls name "Consuela" is derived from this title.

<doc id="54779079" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54779079" title="Filmzene.net">
Filmzene.net

In 2004 Filmzene.net was founded and is <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>’s first and only website that exclusively deals with film music. The site is run by fans, who are passionated by their love for film music.

History.
The beginning:

In 2003 a group of film music loving friends decided that they will develop a much needed, niche, Hungarian website that would specifically focus on the film music genre, but in a way everyone can relate to. They did this, back then, because most websites which discussed films, completely or almost completely left out (one sentence here or there, many times without naming the composer) any references to and/or discussion of the film’s music, despite it being one of the indispensable ingredients to a movie. The website primarily focus’ on symphonic, electronic and other instrumental film music, but there is also write ups about many a film soundtrack.

The goals of the editors was to develop a website that is constantly updated and is a place to learn about film music and its composers and producers, in the hopes that more people will get to know and love the genre. The editors are passionate about introducing the composers to audiences. The website not only features an ever-expanding artistic biography section, but many a time an interview made with said composer. In the spirit of diversity, on Filmzene.net you can find interviews with; organists, conductors, producers, record company executives, and others who may be attached to the genre in some way.

Filmzene.net is a website which is entirely nonprofit, where the editors have been consistent, who are – and where the content is – not affiliated with any film distribution company, or any other organization. The content editors do not describe themselves as film music critics, they are everyday lovers of the genre, who got into this to share their opinions, but who have found that this site has since grown past expectations. Every week the number of introductory articles grows, besides the classics they introduce many new releases, but they regularly write articles about an artist’s lifetime achievements, from today’s, the near past’s and from the Golden Age of Cinema’s talents.

From concept to today:

“December 25th 2003 - the test version of the site goes live.” This sentence could be found on the domain during the test run, which was only visible to the editors. For months, they worked on perfecting the site. During that time the design and the concept was decided upon. In the beginning of July in 2004, 23 biographies and 48 critics were uploaded to Filmzene.net. The “under construction” banner was removed and the site went live. The columns are constantly being updated and more columns were added along the way. 
Columns include film soundtracks, biographies and news and besides these articles about known film composer’s non-film works and their concerts in Hungary and abroad, work done by artists close to the movie music genre, record company executives and studios, and many more.
The next step was to talk to the artists working in the music industry. Thanks to this, since the starting efforts, it was made possible that regular published interviews have become an integral part of the website, as are articles about old and new albums.
Filmzene.net has interviewed such known artists as; <a href="Brian%20Tyler">Brian Tyler</a>, <a href="David%20Arnold">David Arnold</a>, <a href="Graeme%20Revell">Graeme Revell</a>, <a href="John%20Debney">John Debney</a>, <a href="John%20Ottman">John Ottman</a>, <a href="John%20Powell%20%28film%20composer%29">John Powell</a>, <a href="Lisa%20Gerrard">Lisa Gerrard</a>, <a href="Mark%20Isham">Mark Isham</a>, <a href="Marvin%20Hamlisch">Marvin Hamlisch</a>, <a href="Mychael%20Danna">Mychael Danna</a>, <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a> and <a href="Ramin%20Djawadi">Ramin Djawadi</a>.

To date, 2017, there are 1,300 reviews, 60 interviews, and 140 biographies published on the site. There are 55 articles about the collaborations between the composers and the directors of a film, 50 about the music of movie franchises and TV shows. The Legends of Film Music column has writings about 22 composers. There are discussions about 6 studios and 13 record companies. Content also included on the site is 6 short histories of the awards given out to film music creators and the list of nominees and winners.

Septimus (horse)

Septimus (4 April 2003 – December 2010) was an Irish <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> racehorse and <a href="Horse%20breeding%23terminology">sire</a>. In a racing career which was frequently interrupted by injury he won eight of his thirteen races between September 2005 and November 2008. He showed very promising form as a juvenile, winning the <a href="Beresford%20Stakes">Beresford Stakes</a> and finishing third when favourite the <a href="Racing%20Post%20Trophy">Racing Post Trophy</a> and went on to win the <a href="Dante%20Stakes">Dante Stakes</a> by eight <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a> in an abbreviated three-year-old campaign. At four he won the <a href="Mooresbridge%20Stakes">Mooresbridge Stakes</a> and was then stepped up in distance to take the <a href="Lonsdale%20Cup">Lonsdale Cup</a> and the <a href="Doncaster%20Cup">Doncaster Cup</a>. In his final season he won the <a href="Curragh%20Cup">Curragh Cup</a> and the <a href="Irish%20St%20Leger">Irish St Leger</a>, taking the latter event by thirteen lengths. He was rated the best horse in the world over extended distances in both 2007 and 2008. He was retired to stud but had fertility problems and died in 2010 after complications resulting from a <a href="gelding">gelding</a> operation.

Background.
Septimus was a bay horse with a large white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">star</a> and three white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Leg%20markings">socks</a> bred in Ireland by the Barronstown Stud in partnership with Orpendale, a breeding company associated with the <a href="Coolmore%20Stud">Coolmore Stud</a> organisation. In September 2004 the <a href="yearling%20%28horse%29">yearling</a> was consigned by Barronstown to the Goffs sales and was bought for €220,000 by Coolmore's bloodstock agent Dermot "Demi" O'Byrne. He was sent into training with <a href="Aidan%20O%27Brien">Aidan O'Brien</a> at <a href="Ballydoyle">Ballydoyle</a>. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of his ownership changed from race to race: he was sometimes listed as being the property of Derrick Smith, whilst on other occasions he was described as being owned by a partnership of Smith, <a href="Michael%20Tabor">Michael Tabor</a> and <a href="Susan%20Magnier">Susan Magnier</a>.

He was from the eighteenth crop of foals sired by <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20%28horse%29">Sadler's Wells</a>, who won the <a href="Irish%202000%20Guineas">Irish 2000 Guineas</a>, <a href="Eclipse%20Stakes">Eclipse Stakes</a> and <a href="Irish%20Champion%20Stakes">Irish Champion Stakes</a> in 1984 went on to be the <a href="Leading%20sire%20in%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Champion sire</a> on fourteen occasions. His dam Caladira who was bred and owned by <a href="Aga%20Khan%20IV">Aga Khan IV</a> won on her racecourse debut and finished unplaced on her only subsequent start. She was a great-granddaughter of the British broodmare Run Honey (foaled 1946) whose other descendants have included <a href="Aloma%27s%20Ruler">Aloma's Ruler</a> and <a href="Cirrus%20des%20Aigles">Cirrus des Aigles</a>.

Racing career.
2005: two-year-old season.
Septimus began his track career in a seven <a href="furlong">furlong</a> <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> on 10 September on <a href="Leopardstown%20Racecourse">Leopardstown Racecourse</a> in which he was ridden by <a href="Wayne%20Lordan">Wayne Lordan</a> and won by half a <a href="Horse%20length">length</a> from his stablemate Arabian Prince. He was then moved up sharply in class for the <a href="Group%20races">Group 2</a> Beresford Stakes over the same distance at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh</a> on 9 October and started <a href="Fractional%20odds">4/6</a> favourite against five opponents. Ridden by <a href="Seamie%20Heffernan">Seamie Heffernan</a>, he tracked the leaders before taking the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from Rekaab. After the race he was offered at odds of 25/1 for the following year's <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a>.

Two weeks after his win at the Curragh, Septimus was sent to England and moved up in class and distance for the Group 1 <a href="Racing%20Post%20Trophy">Racing Post Trophy</a> over one mile on <a href="Going%20%28horse%20racing%29">heavy ground</a> at <a href="Doncaster%20Racecourse">Doncaster Racecourse</a>. He was made the odds-on favourite but looked to be outpaced in the final stages and finished third to <a href="Palace%20Episode">Palace Episode</a> and Winged Cupid.

2006: three-year-old season.
On 23 April Septimus began his second season with a trip to France for the <a href="Prix%20La%20Force">Prix La Force</a> over 2000 metres at <a href="Longchamp%20Racecourse">Longchamp Racecourse</a> in which he was well-fancied, but never looked likely to win and finished seventh of the nine runners behind Barastraight. On his next appearance he contested the Dante Stakes (a major trial race for the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a>) over ten and a half furlongs at <a href="York%20Racecourse">York Racecourse</a> on 18 May. Racing on soft ground and partnered by <a href="Kieren%20Fallon">Kieren Fallon</a> he started 13/8 favourite ahead of Palace Episode and four other colts. After tracking the leaders he went to the front a quarter of a mile from thefinish and drew right away from his opponents to win by eight lengths from the <a href="Michael%20Stoute">Michael Stoute</a>-trained Best Alibi. Fallon commented "I'm happy he's got this race under his belt and he deserves it. This horse is very fluent so we could take him anywhere... the way he went away from them there with his ears pricked, you'd have to be impressed".

On 3 June Septimus joined <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%20%28horse%29">Horatio Nelson</a>, <a href="Dylan%20Thomas%20%28horse%29">Dylan Thomas</a> and Mountain in a four-horse Ballydoyle entry for the Epsom Derby and started the 17/2 fourth choice in the betting. He was towards the rear of the field from the start and came home twelfth of the seventeen finishers behind <a href="Sir%20Percy">Sir Percy</a>. The colt subsequently had injury problems and missed the rest of the season.

In the <a href="2006%20World%20Thoroughbred%20Racehorse%20Rankings">2006 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings</a> Septimus was given a rating of 116, making him the 105th best racehorse in the world.

2007: four-year-old season.
After an absence of over eleven months, Septimus returned in the Group 3 Mooresbridge Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 7 May 2007. Ridden by Heffernan he was made 4/1 second favourite behind Mustameet, a six-year-old whose wins included the <a href="Royal%20Whip%20Stakes">Royal Whip Stakes</a> and the <a href="Gladness%20Stakes">Gladness Stakes</a> whilst the other runners included Championship Point (<a href="Predominate%20Stakes">Predominate Stakes</a>), Fracas (<a href="Derrinstown%20Stud%20Derby%20Trial">Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial</a>) and Grand Passion (<a href="Celebration%20Stakes">Celebration Stakes</a>). Septimus raced in second place behind Championship Point before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from Fracas. Following the race O'Brien said "He did that very well - he's a very tough horse. Considering he's been off the track since the Derby that was great as he came back from that race a bit sore. I think he could be a serious horse in the autumn". At Epsom on 1 June the colt returned to the highest class for the <a href="Coronation%20Cup">Coronation Cup</a> in which he led for most of the way before finishing second to his stablemate <a href="Scorpion%20%28horse%29">Scorpion</a> with Sir Percy and <a href="Sixties%20Icon">Sixties Icon</a> finishing in sixth and seventh place.

More than eleven weeks after his run at Epsom Septimus returned to the track an was moved up in distance for the Group 2 Lonsdale Cup over two miles at York and started 6/5 favourite against eight opponents including Sergeant Cecil (<a href="Ebor%20Handicap">Ebor Handicap</a>, <a href="Cesarewitch%20Handicap">Cesarewitch Handicap</a>), Distinction (<a href="Goodwood%20Cup">Goodwood Cup</a>), and Percussionist (<a href="Yorkshire%20Cup%20%28horse%20race%29">Yorkshire Cup</a>). Ridden by <a href="Johnny%20Murtagh">Johnny Murtagh</a>, Septimus ranced in third place for mot of the way before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and winning by a neck from Balkan Knight. Murtagh was again in the saddle when Septimus returned to Yorkshire and started the 11/10 favourite for the Doncaster Cup over two and a quarter miles on 14 September. Ditinction and Balkan Knight were again in opposition but his most serious rivals appeared to be Allegretto (Goodwood Cup) and Geordieland (<a href="Grand%20Prix%20de%20Chantilly">Grand Prix de Chantilly</a>). Murtagh settled the colt in third place as Finalmente set the pace and opened up a clear lead. Septimus made steady progress, overtook Finalmente approaching the last quarter mile and accelerated away from his rivals to win "easily" by five lengths. After the race Murtagh commented "He's a very progressive horse and has really improved. He showed he has no problem with the trip... he has a bit of speed, and is a class above those stayers at the moment".

In the <a href="2007%20World%20Thoroughbred%20Racehorse%20Rankings">2007 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings</a> Septimus was rated the 17th best racehorse in the world and the best horse over extended distances.

2008: five-year-old season.
Septimus was off the track for nine and a half months before returning in the Group 3 Curragh Cup over 14 furlongs on 28 June 2008 in which he carried 140 pounds and started the odds-on favourite. After racing in fifth place he took the lead approching the final furlong and won by two and half lengths from Mores Wells (<a href="Ballyroan%20Stakes">Ballyroan Stakes</a>) with Peppertree Lane (the winner of the race in 2007) a neck away in third place.

The Irish St Leger on 13 September at the Curragh was expected to feature a clash between Septimus and his seven-year-old stablemate <a href="Yeats%20%28horse%29">Yeats</a>, but when Yeats was withdrawn from the contest Septimus was made the 1/3 favourite. The field did not appear to be a strong one, with the only other runners to start at less than 25/1 being Mores Wells, Hasanka (<a href="Ballycullen%20Stakes">Ballycullen Stakes</a>) and Yellowstone (<a href="Gordon%20Stakes">Gordon Stakes</a>). Heffernan settled the favourite in third place as his stablemate Mikhail Fokhine set the pace from another Ballydoyle outsider New Zealand. Septimus moved up alongide the pacemakers entering the straight, went to the front, and drew away from the field to win "very easily" by thirteen lengths. His win made Aidan O'Brien (who was at the Doncaster St Leger meeting on the day) the first trainer in 73 years to win all five of the <a href="Irish%20Classic%20Races">Irish Classic Races</a>. O'Brien's wife Anne-Marie addressed the press after the race and said "I’m so happy for everyone associated with Ballydoyle, and we’ve been so lucky that the horses have stayed sound. Septimus got his opportunity today and I’m really thrilled".

For his final racecourse appearance, Septimus, who was being described as "the best stayer in the world", was shipped to Australia to contest the <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a> over 3200 metres at <a href="Flemington%20Racecourse">Flemington Racecourse</a> on 4 November. Starting the 6/1 second favourite he was among the leaders from the start but faded badly in the straight and finished lame in eighteenth place. After the race Murtagh commented "I think we need to examine what type of horse to bring to Australia. Septimus wasn’t the right one".

In the <a href="2008%20World%20Thoroughbred%20Rankings">2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings</a> Septimus was rated the 23rd best racehorse in the world and the equal-best horse over extended distances alongside <a href="Conduit%20%28horse%29">Conduit</a> and <a href="Yeats%20%28horse%29">Yeats</a>.

Stud career.
Septimus remained in training in 2009 but did not race again. He was retired to stud at the end of the year and was marketed as a <a href="National%20Hunt">National Hunt</a> stallion. Standing at Coolmore's Castle Hyde stud in <a href="County%20Cork">County Cork</a> he had problems with fertility and managed to get only three mares <a href="pregnant">in foal</a>. He was withdrawn from stud duties and gelded but died from complications arising from the surgery in December 2010.

Golweyn ambush

The Golweyn ambush by <a href="Al-Shabaab%20%28militant%20group%29">al-Shabaab</a> militants against an <a href="African%20Union%20Mission%20to%20Somalia">AMISOM</a> convoy took place on 30 July 2017. Resulting in the death of several <a href="Uganda%20People%27s%20Defence%20Force">Ugandan soldiers</a>, the attack seriously disrupted the control of pro-government forces over the <a href="Lower%20Shebelle">Lower Shebelle</a> region in <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>, eventually leading to the fall of the strategically significant town of <a href="Lego%2C%20Somalia">Leego</a> to al-Shabaab.

Background.
Much of Lower Shebelle, including Golweyn, was conquered from <a href="Al-Shabaab%20%28militant%20group%29">al-Shabaab</a> by <a href="African%20Union%20Mission%20to%20Somalia">AMISOM</a> and the <a href="Somali%20Armed%20Forces">Somali Armed Forces</a> (SNAF) during <a href="Operation%20Indian%20Ocean">Operation Indian Ocean</a> in 2014, and had been secured by the <a href="Uganda%20People%27s%20Defence%20Force">Ugandan military</a> since the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leego%20%282015%29">deadly insurgent attack</a> on the <a href="Military%20of%20Burundi">Burundian garrison</a> of <a href="Lego%2C%20Somalia">Leego</a> in 2015. In 2016, however, offensive operations against al-Shabaab were reduced, allowing the militant group to rebuild its strength. 

Despite al-Shabaab's growing power, mounting casualties among AMISOM <a href="Peacekeeping">peacekeepers</a> and their already long presence in the war-torn country has led to plans to reduce ANISOM's presence in Somalia. Security responsibilities are supposed to be transferred to the <a href="Federal%20Government%20of%20Somalia">Somali government</a>'s military. According to Lower Shebelle's deputy governor Ali Nur Mohamed, however, the SNAF units in his region have been weakened by factionalization, infighting and desertation. Because of that, they are not able to independently hold territory against insurgents, meaning that the presence of ANISOM troops in government-controlled areas of Lower Shebelle is crucial.

Ambush.
On early 30 July 2017, a military convoy consisting of parts of the UPDF's 7th Battalion of the 22nd <a href="Battlegroup%20%28army%29">battlegroup</a> as well as some SNAF soldiers, left Shalanbod. The convoy, which was about of about <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>-strength, was either supposed to conduct a regular patrol on the <a href="Mogadishu">Mogadishu</a>-<a href="Barawa">Barawa</a> Main Supply Route, or transport supplies to the AMISOM/SNAF bases in Lower Shebelle. As the UPDF/SNAF forces entered the village of Golweyn, near <a href="Bulo%20Marer">Bulo Marer</a>, an <a href="improvised%20explosive%20device">improvised explosive device</a> on the road hit the convoy, whereupon heavily armed al-Shabaab fighters launched their assault. A fierce firefight ensued that lasted for about one hour, after which the militants retreated, reportedly taking the bodies of some dead Ugandan soldiers with them.
Although the exact Ugandan casualities are disputed, with the Ugandan military downplaying and al-Shabaab exaggerating them, they were heavier than those of the attackers. According to the Somali government, around 23 Ugandans were killed and numerous wounded, while al-Shabaab managed to take supplies and weaponry from the convoy.

Aftermath: The fall of Leego.
The most important effect of the ambush was to show that the important supply route between Mogadishu and Barawa was insecure and threatened by al-Shabaab. As result, AMISOM felt it had to deploy additional troops along the route in order to resecure it. The force chosen for this purpose was the Ugandan garrison of Leego, a strategically important town and major ANISOM military base. As the international peacekeeping forces were already suffering from manpower shortages, however, the Ugandans could not be replaced by other forces in time. When the UPDF soldiers consequently moved from Leego to Golweyn on 4 July, the former was left completely defenseless. Somali government officials protested this, saying that they had not been consulted and that without the ANISOM garrison Leego would soon fall to the insurgents; this promptly happened, as al-Shabaab immediately occupied Leego unopposed after the Ugandans had retreated.

This was a heavy blow to ANISOM and the Somali government, as Leego had controlled another important supply route from Mogadishu to the regions of <a href="Bay%2C%20Somalia">Bay</a> and <a href="Bakool">Bakool</a>; thousands of pro-government soldiers in these areas were thus effectively cut off and could only be supplied or reinforced by air. On 6 July, the ANISOM high command reportedly assured Lower Shebelle's government that the <a href="Ethiopian%20National%20Defense%20Force">Ethiopian military</a> would soon send new troops in order to reconquer Leego.

Georges Fontenis

Georges Fontenis (27 April 1920 - 9 August 2010) was a school teacher who worked in <a href="Tours">Tours</a>. He is more widely remembered on account of his political involvement, especially during the 1950s and 1960s. A <a href="Anarcho-communism">libertarian communist</a> and trades unionist, he was a leading figure in the <a href="Anarchism">anarchist movement</a>.

Life.
Early years.
Described by one authority as "the son and grandson of militant socialists", Georges Louis Albert Fontenis was born into a working class family in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and grew up in the city's suburbs. As a young teenager he devoured his father's revolutionary socialist and trades union journals and newspapers and other Trotskyite and pacifist literature. He became involved with the during the strikes of June 1936. When he was 17 he joined the Anarchist Union, "discovered" <a href="Mikhail%20Bakunin">Bakunin</a> and <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a>, and started selling <a href="Le%20Libertaire">Le Libertaire</a> on street corners.

Activism and teaching.
<a href="France">France</a> was <a href="Battle%20for%20France">invaded</a> by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> during May/June 1940. Political and trades union activity was banned, with the result that various political organisations, including the <a href="General%20Confederation%20of%20Labour%20%28France%29">Trades Union Confederation (""Confédération générale du travail"" / CGT)</a> itself, "went underground", becoming progressively incorporated into the wider <a href="French%20Resistance">French Resistance</a> movement. Fontenis joined the "clandestine CGT", also participating actively in local syndicalist groups. By this time he was working as a primary school teacher in the <a href="19th%20arrondissement%20of%20Paris">north-eastern part</a> of Paris. He was also involved after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">war</a> with and in a relaunch of another sort of school, the , a revolutionary syndicalist grouping of (sometimes) like-minded activists.

After the teachers' strike in the Seine department in November-December 1947 Georges Fontenis briefly joined the <a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20nationale%20du%20travail">National Labour Confederation (""Confédération nationale du travail"" / CNT-F)</a>, but then returned to the more mainstream in which he continued to press the militant agenda of . After he was arrested by the <a href="Direction%20de%20la%20surveillance%20du%20territoire">security services</a> and his sentencing in 1957, which was part of a broader crack-down on the anarchist movement, he was reinstated into the teaching profession in 1958 and enrolled at the , a large primary school in the western part of Paris. He became a primary schools inspector in a rural zone between 1962 and 1967 and then, in September 1967, a teacher of <a href="Psychopedagogy">Psychopedagogy</a> at the teachers' training academy in <a href="Tours">Tours</a>.

Secretary General of the Anarchist Federation (France).
After the <a href="Second%20World%20War">war</a> ended Georges Fontenis was one of the founders of the <a href="Anarchist%20Federation%20%28France%29">Anarchist Federation</a>. Others included Robert Joulin, Henri Bouyé, <a href="Maurice%20Joyeux">Maurice Joyeux</a>, , <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Lamberet">Renée Lamberet</a>, <a href="Georges%20Vincey">Georges Vincey</a>, and , <a href="Maurice%20Laisant">Maurice Laisant</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Fayolle">Maurice Fayolle</a>, <a href="Giliana%20Berneri">Giliana Berneri</a>, Solange Dumont, <a href="Roger%20Caron">Roger Caron</a>, Henri Oriol et Paul Chery. Over the next few years his life was closely aligned with that of the libertarian movement till 1957. That was the year in which he was arrested by the <a href="Direction%20de%20la%20surveillance%20du%20territoire">security services</a> because of his support for <a href="National%20Liberation%20Front%20%28Algeria%29">Algerian separatists</a>.

In 1946 he was elected secretary general of the <a href="Anarchist%20Federation%20%28France%29">Anarchist Federation</a>. For many in the movement his was a relatively new face which made it easier for him to find consensus because he was not a member of any existing faction. In reality, however, <a href="Anarcho-communism">Anarcho-communist</a> and <a href="Individualist%20anarchism">Individualist anarchist</a> tendencies did not sit comfortably with the federation's priorities. The individualist anarchists, led by the and <a href="Jean-Ren%C3%A9%20Sauli%C3%A8re">Jean-René Saulière</a>, organised a "letter-writing lobby". As <a href="Maurice%20Joyeux">Maurice Joyeux</a> put it, "It was not really a structured group intended to exclude those who thought differently from them from the <a href="Anarchist%20Federation%20%28France%29">Anarchist Federation</a>, but a network of letter-writing across the country which led to an identical set of results. Which is to say they pre-primed the congress in respect of the proposals they set out, outside the congress meeting".

In 1948 George Fontenis teamed up with a group of exiled <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo">CNT</a> and <a href="Federaci%C3%B3n%20Anarquista%20Ib%C3%A9rica">FAI</a> militants to attempt the assassination of <a href="Francisco%20Franco">General Franco</a>. The plan involved purchasing an aircraft, which could not be done successfully by a Spanish passport holder. Fontenis provided his name and nationality for the purchase of a small aeroplane, intended to be used to bomb a pleasure boat occupied by <a href="Francisco%20Franco">the "Causillo"</a> in <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Bay">San Sebastián Bay</a>. The attempt failed. In February 1951 Fontenis was briefly arrested in connection with the affair, but soon released because alleged (but fictitious) links to the plotters could not be demonstrated.

Libertarian Communist Federation (""Fédération communiste libertaire"").
At the start of 1950 a group of militants around and Georges Fontenis set about establishing a communist libertarian group - described by <a href="Maurice%20Joyeux">Maurice Joyeux</a> as a "clandestine party inside the Anarchist Federation", and by another commentaro as "a kind of secret ginger group" - which they called the [[:fr:Organisation Pensée BatailleOrgansation of Battle Planning (""Organisation Pensée Bataille"" / OPB), as a tribute to [[Camillo Berneri]] and his 1936 book "Pensée et bataille". OPB members decided to keep their organisation's existence secret. In May/June 1952, at the Anarchist Federation congress at Bordeaux, they moved to expel [[:fr:Paul Lapeyre|the Lapeyre brothers]], [[Maurice Joyeux]] and [[Maurice Fayolle]]. The bitterness engendered and Georges Fontenis' centrality to the acrimonious affair meant that for many years afterwards he would be singled out for demonisation in the speeches and writings of traditionally more mainstream anarchists. 

At the congress in Paris in May 1953 the libertarian communist faction prevailed. The congress adopted the "Declaration of Principles" project which asserted the libertarian communist objectives of the organisation. Unable to agree on a new name for the relaunched organisation at the time, it was only after a members' referendum in December 1953 that the French "Anarchist Federation" became the "Libertarian Communist Federation", with 11 of the 16 regional groups (comprising between 130 and 160 individual activists) under the direction of the OPB. Groups from [[Asnières]] and [[Bordeaux]] were excluded. The [[Individualist anarchism|Individualist anarchists]] and some of the communist libertarians regrouped separately around [[Maurice Joyeux]] who had found the tactics adopted by the OPB unacceptable, and set about creating a new "breakaway" Anarchist Federation. 

It was also in 1953 that George Fontenis wrote "Manifesto of libertarian communism - essential problems", which has been described variously as "Leninist", "avant gardist" and/or "Bolschevist".. In August 1954 the "Kronstadt" libertarian-communist group published a memorandum condemning the secretive structure and the Leninism of the wider "Libertarian Communist Federation", and were, in 1955, expelled. During 1954 Fontenis himself had increasingly diverted his focus and that of the federation to political and "logistical" support for the [[Algerian nationalism|"Algerian insurrection"]].

In January 1956 the Libertarian Communist Federation submitted a list of ten "revolutionary candidates" for the [[French legislative election, 1956|national legislative elections]]. Georges Fontenis was one. The next year the Libertarian Communist Federation was destroyed by state authorities. Several leading figures in it were arrested and detained as part of an attack on the survival of the "Poujadist Movement". Georges Fontenis was one. The next year he was released as part of a wider amnesty enacted by [[Charles de Gaulle|President de Gaulle]]. There followed a dozen years during which very little was heard either of the libertarian communist movement of of Georges Fontenis.

After the [[May 1968 events in France|"May '68 events"]].
In 1968 Georges Fontenis was a co-founder of the "Communist Libertarian Movement" (""Mouvement communiste libertaire"" / MCL) which shortly afterwards became the "Communist Libertarian Organsiation" (""Organisation communiste libertaire"" . OCL) but then, in the words of one source, "with the growth of a widespread social apathy in the years following 1974", was dissolved in 1976. 

In 1979 he joined the [[:fr:Union des travailleurs communistes libertaires|Union of Communist Libertarian Workers (""Union des travailleurs communistes libertaires"" / UTCL)]]. Georges Fontenis remained a member of the successor organisation, "[[Alternative libertaire]]", but in his later years he wrote less and less. He died at his home at [[Reignac-sur-Indre]] (a little to the south-east of [[Tours]]) on 9 August 2010.

In 1990 he issued his memoirs under the title "L'Autre communisme, histoire subversive du [[:fr:Mouvement libertaire|mouvement libertaire]]" (""The other communism: a subversive history of the [[:fr:Mouvement libertaire|Libertarian Movement]]""). An expanded and re-edited version appeared in 2000, something that happened again in 2008. The title changed, too, becoming "Changer le monde, histoire du [[:fr:Anarcho-communisme|mouvement communiste libertaire]] (1945-1997)" (""Changing the world: A history of the [[Anarcho-communism|Communist Libertarian Movement]] (1945-1997)"")

HomeBiogas

HomeBiogas is a <a href="biogas">biogas</a> company based in <a href="Beit%20Yanai">Beit Yanai</a>, Israel. The company produces and sells anaerobic digesters that convert organic waste into methane gas and liquid fertilizer.

Founding.
In 2007, HomeBioGas cofounder Yair Teller observed small biogas systems in Mexico. Inspired, he traveled to other developing nations to learn more.
Teller, and cofounder Oshik Efrati, acquired many biogas systems from China and India. They installed them locally, quickly judging them to work poorly.
Particularly, Teller and Efrati believed these systems suffered from poor efficiency, unpleasant odors and insect infestations. 

In 2012, Teller and Efrati, now joined by final co-founder Erez Lancer, formally created HomeBiogas.

Partnerships.
Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, in 2014, purchased HomeBiogas units, distributing them to <a href="Umm%20Batin">Umm Batin</a> Bedouin village. Shortly afterwards, the Ministry purchased 25 additional systems and again distributed them to Umm Batin, and another Negev Bedouin village. Similarly, HomeBiogas has also supplied biodigesters to Bedouins in the Negev in conjunction with the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies.

After learning of the Umm Batin program, multiple governments reached out to HomeBiogas. Prominent among them is the Dominican Republic, whose government purchased 50 HomeBiogas appliances in an effort to reduce citizen dependence on wood for heating.

The <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and the <a href="Peres%20Center%20for%20Peace">Peres Center for Peace</a> contracted HomeBiogas to install HomeBiogas digesters in the central West Bank's Jordan Valley in 2015. Approximately 40 digesters were installed, with the European Union providing the 500,000 euros in funding.

Commercialization.
In January 2016, HomeBiogas expanded into the domestic sector, launching an <a href="Indiegogo">Indiegogo</a> campaign. The campaign reached its goal of $100,000 in the first 24 hours, eventually culminating in over $250,000 raised. These first commercial units shipped in May, 2016.

HomeBiogas appliance.
The HomeBiogas system generates biogas by anaerobically fermenting organic matter. Types of acceptable organic matter include meat, dairy, and animal manure, as well. The anaerobic digestion is achieved by bacteria living inside the system. As a result, HomeBiogas runs without electricity. 

As of 2016, HomeBiogas can receive inputs of up to six liters per day of <a href="food%20waste">food waste</a>, or up to 15 liters per day of <a href="animal%20manure">animal manure</a>. Each kilogram may produce 200 liters of biogas, enough fuel for an hour of cooking.

Environmental impact.
Annually, each HomeBiogas system may eliminate up to one ton of organic waste, and six tons of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>.

History of Plymouth, Pennsylvania

<a href="Plymouth%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plymouth, Pennsylvania</a> sits on the west side of Pennsylvania's Wyoming Valley, wedged between the Susquehanna River and the Shawnee Mountain range. Just below the mountain are seven hills that surround the town like the <a href="hills%20of%20Rome">Hills of Rome</a>, and form a natural amphitheater that separates the town from the rest of the valley. The hills are named Avondale Hill, Curry Hill, Turkey Hill (or Cemetery Hill), Levi's Hill, Welsh Hill, Pierce Hill (or Shonk Hill), and Ross Hill. Eight creeks run between the hills down to the river. These are <a href="Harveys%20Creek">Harveys Creek</a>, Jersey Creek, <a href="Coal%20Creek%20%28Susquehanna%20River%29">Coal Creek</a> (formerly Mill Creek, Smith's Creek or Ransom Creek), <a href="Wadham%20Creek">Wadham's Creek</a> (formerly Whittlesey's Creek), <a href="Brown%20Creek">Brown's Creek</a> (formerly Nesbitt's Creek, Cooper's Run or Pine Swamp Creek), Shupp's Creek, and <a href="Toby%20Creek">Toby's Creek</a>. Below the hills, the flat lands are formed in the shape of a frying pan, the pan being the Shawnee flats, once the center of the town's agricultural activities, and the handle being a spit of narrow land extending east from the flats, where the center of town is located.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Plymouth's primary industry was agriculture. However, vast <a href="anthracite">anthracite</a> coal beds lay below the surface at various depths, and by the 1850s, coal mining was the town's primary occupation.

History of Plymouth, Pennsylvania (1753–1972).
The Yankee era (1753–1860).
The Susquehanna Company and early settlement

The origins of <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plymouth</a> (also known as Shawnee and Shawneetown) date back to the creation of the Susquehanna Company in <a href="Windham%2C%20Connecticut">Windham, Connecticut</a>, on June 18, 1753, formed to promote the settlement of certain lands along the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna</a> in what is now <a href="northeastern%20Pennsylvania">northeastern Pennsylvania</a>. This place, called "<a href="Wyoming%20Valley">Wyoming</a>", fell within the bounds of the charter issued in 1662 by <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> to the <a href="Connecticut%20Colony">Connecticut Colony</a>. It also fell within the bounds of the charter issued by the same king in 1681 to <a href="William%20Penn">William Penn</a>, thus setting the stage for a conflict between the two colonies.

In 1754 at <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a>, the Susquehanna Company purchased a deed to a tract of land along the Susquehanna River from the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> (Six Nations) who had long held the land by right of conquest, and in 1769, John Durkee and a group of 240 Connecticut settlers created five townships, surveying their bounds, naming them Wilkesbarre (later renamed <a href="Wilkes-Barre%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wilkes-Barre</a>), Nanticoke (later renamed Hanover), Pittstown (later renamed <a href="Pittston%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittston</a>), Forty (later renamed <a href="Kingston%2C%20Pennsylvania">Kingston</a>) and Plymouth. During the summer of 1770, the settlers began to sub-divide the five townships into lots, and settlement began in earnest in 1772.

Armed men loyal to Pennsylvania twice attempted to evict the Connecticut settlers in what are known as the <a href="Pennamite-Yankee%20War">Pennamite-Yankee War</a>s. Following the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> and ratification of the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a> in 1781, Pennsylvania sued to resolve the conflict with Connecticut. A trial was held at <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton, New Jersey</a> in 1782, and the conflict resolved in favor of Pennsylvania, which was granted full jurisdiction over the Susquehanna Company's lands.

Years of uncertainty ensued for the Connecticut settlers in the <a href="Wyoming%20Valley">Wyoming Valley</a>, until April 1799, when Pennsylvania passed the Compromise Act allowing settlers (in those townships which had been created and settled before the Trenton Decree of 1782) to pay a fee in return for certification of their ownership. Thus, Plymouth landowners who could establish their chain of title retained ownership of their land, but came under the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania. The process took years, but by 1811 most land claims had been resolved. Today, all ownership of land in Plymouth can be traced back to these certified titles.

The Smith Coal Mines

At the beginning of the 19th century, Plymouth's primary industry was agriculture. However, vast <a href="anthracite">anthracite</a> coal beds lay below the surface at various depths. At a few locations these beds were visible in the form of outcrops, and one such location was a gorge created by Ransom Creek (now Coal Creek) located about a mile upstream from the Susquehanna River. Coal could be seen (and accessed) on both the east side (Turkey Hill) and the west side (Curry Hill) of the creek.

Attracted by this outcrop, Abijah Smith came to Plymouth about 1806 from <a href="Derby%2C%20Connecticut">Derby, Connecticut</a>, intending to mine, ship and sell coal. In the fall of 1807, Smith floated an ark down the Susquehanna River loaded with about fifty tons of anthracite coal, and shipped it to <a href="Columbia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Columbia</a> in <a href="Lancaster%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster County</a>. The significance of Smith's shipment went unnoticed until 1873, when Hendrick B. Wright, in his "Historical Sketches of Plymouth", wrote,
"Anthracite coal had been used before 1807, in this valley and elsewhere, in small quantities in furnaces, with an air blast; but the traffic in coal as an article of general use, was commenced by Abijah Smith, of Plymouth."
In 1811, Smith's brother, John Smith, began to mine coal on the west side of the creek. This second mine (often called, erroneously, Plymouth's first coal mine) achieved national fame as a kind of tourist attraction. In 1829, a writer from Wilkes-Barre posted a notice in the "Connecticut Mirror", writing, "among the curiosities of our county (and we have a few) are Smith's Coal Mines, situated in Plymouth township in this county ... it sends a sudden twinge through a fellow, say, to think himself walking under a mountain fifty feet through, with only here and there a pillar to support it ... those who feel desirous of knowing more about this matter, must do as many others have done – go and see for themselves."

Over time, Plymouth's and the Wyoming Valley's coal industry grew steadily. In 1830, the "Baltimore Patriot" reported that "... a greater quantity of Anthracite Coal has been sent down the Susquehanna this Spring than in any former season. The Baltimore Company have sent three thousand tons, and from other mines about seven thousand tons were dispatched, making an aggregate of ten thousand tons."

The North Branch Canal

As late as the 1840s, whenever high water allowed, coal from Wyoming Valley's coal mines was shipped down the Susquehanna River on wooden arks. But by the end of 1830, canal boats began to replace arks as the preferred method of transporting coal and other goods to market. In 1826, the Pennsylvania Board of Canal Commissioners began to survey the route of a new canal, to be called the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Canal">North Branch Canal</a>, to run alongside the north branch (the main branch) of the Susquehanna River from <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland</a> to the <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> border. The work was generally complete by the fall of 1830, and the first load of coal shipped from Wyoming Valley reached <a href="Berwick%2C%20Pennsylvania">Berwick</a> in October.

The canal was a boon to Plymouth's coal operators, who in 1830 included John Smith, Freeman Thomas, Henderson Gaylord and Thomas Borbidge, and encouraged others to open mines, such as Jameson Harvey and Jacob Gould. John Smith's teamsters led teams of horses deep into his mine, turned the team, loaded the wagon and then drove the team to the river bank to load the coal into <a href="Narrowboat">canal boats</a>. Gaylord, whose mine was at the base of Welsh Hill, improved on this method and built a <a href="gravity%20railroad">gravity railroad</a> that ran along what is now Walnut Street, down what is now Gaylord Avenue, to his wharf on the river. A similar branch, called the Swetland Railroad, was built from mines in Poke Hollow down a route which later became Washington Avenue, across Bull Run to another wharf on the river. Freeman Thomas built a railroad from his Grand Tunnel mine to a chutehouse along the river near the entrance to the canal.

The early coal mines in Plymouth supported an ancillary industry, boat building. The arks used to transport goods on the river were built in a basin where <a href="Wadham%20Creek">Wadham's Creek</a> entered the river. After the canal was built, the arks began to be replaced by flat-bottomed canal boats, built in the same basin with a distinctive design, known as "Shawnee boats." Many of the town's young men became boatmen and were well known along the length of the canal for their distinctive call, "Shawnee against the World." George Bedford, writing in 1917, evoked the antebellum charm and character of Plymouth in the 1840s:
There was at that time no evidence in sight of coal mining. At several places on the main street there were small clusters of houses, but all else was highly cultivated farm land, extending from well up on the slope of the mountain to the river's shore ... Taking it all in, there was no more beautiful part of the Wyoming Valley. In the twilight of the summer evenings we were wont to sit at the front of the old home and hear the pleasant and oft recurring sound of the boatman's horn miles away, wafted across the river and giving signal to the keeper of the outlet lock [at West Nanticoke] to make ready for the passage of boats in and out of the canal. Alas, all is changed! Towering <a href="coal%20breaker">coal breaker</a>s and huge <a href="spoil%20tip">culm</a> banks are marked features of the landscape. The canal and its locks, its boats and its boatmen, together with the boatman's horn, have long since passed away.

Years of industrial growth (1861–1900).
The Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad

The <a href="Lackawanna%20and%20Bloomsburg%20Railroad">Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad</a> was incorporated by a charter from the Pennsylvania state legislature on April 5, 1852. The Board of Directors of the railroad included two Plymouth native sons, Henderson Gaylord and William C. Reynolds. The railroad reached Plymouth by 1857, and by June 1860, all of the railroad, from <a href="Scranton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Scranton</a> to Northumberland, were complete. In 1873, the line came under the control of the <a href="Delaware%2C%20Lackawanna%20and%20Western%20Railroad">Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad</a>, which was backed by powerful New York financiers, and which operated several <a href="collieries">collieries</a> along its length, including the Avondale Colliery in Plymouth.

The completion of the <a href="Lackawanna%20and%20Bloomsburg%20Railroad">Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad</a> connected Plymouth to the nation's growing transportation grid, making it easier and cheaper for mine operators to ship large quantities of coal to distant markets. The railroad's arrival led to the rapid transformation of the small agricultural village into a major supplier of anthracite coal. Small mining operations founded by local residents gave way to large, highly capitalized collieries, capable of reaching coal veins deep underground. These large operations attracted foreign labor, first from the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, and then from <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>.

Industrial growth brought the town prosperity, which in turn brought amenities like a central water system, gas and electrical systems, paved streets, sewers, elaborate school buildings and a <a href="tram">trolley</a> system connecting Plymouth's residents to other towns and cities in the Wyoming Valley. On the other hand, industrial growth had disadvantages, including strife between labor and management, and wild swings in the economic cycle. The jobs provided by the coal industry came with the constant risk of death or injury and, for those who survived, chronic health problems. The annals of Plymouth's history include a long list of mining fatalities as well as one of the nation's greatest mine disasters.

Capt. David Schooley's Map of 1864

In 1864, Capt. David Schooley published a detailed map of Luzerne County, including Plymouth Township, two years before the borough was incorporated. The map illustrates the <a href="Lackawanna%20and%20Bloomsburg%20Railroad">Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad</a> running through the town, as well as four branch railroads that connected coal mines either to the new railroad, or to wharves along the river. These branch railroads were (from east to west): The Swetland Railroad, running from Poke Hollow across Bull Run to a wharf on the river; The Gaylord Railroad, running from Poke Hollow, across what would later become Walnut Street, and then down what would later become Gaylord Avenue, to Gaylord's wharf on the river; The Smith, or Reynolds Railroad, running from the Smith mines along Coal Creek to the Smith boat basin along the river; The Jersey Railroad, connecting the Jersey Colliery to the new railroad. The Map illustrates Plymouth just before its mines were taken over by major corporate operators.

The First National Bank

The First National Bank of Plymouth was organized on December 10, 1864, under the <a href="National%20Banking%20Law%20of%201863">National Banking Law of 1863</a>, which authorized banks to handle and distribute national currency. The bank opened its doors for business on February 22, 1865, and was granted Federal Certificate No. 707 in September 1865. The enterprise was started with capital of $100,000.

The bank's earliest directors included the heads of Plymouth's old <a href="Yankee">Yankee</a> families. Smith, Gaylord, Turner, Reynolds, Davenport and Harvey were represented. Notably absent was the Wadhams family. The directors also included a smattering of more recently arrived men, such as the <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>-born William L. Lance, and the <a href="Scotsman">Scotsman</a>, Charles Hutchison. But whatever their family background, all of the directors were involved in the coal business. The bank was formed at a time of transition for the coal industry, when the town's independent mine operators (most of whom were directors of the bank) were handing over the operation of their mines, either by lease or by sale, to a few large corporations — by 1880, the Kingston Coal Co., the Delaware & Hudson Canal Co., the <a href="Delaware%2C%20Lackawanna%20and%20Western%20Railroad">Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad</a>, and the Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. would control most of Plymouth's coal mines.

Initially, the First National Bank's directors met in the MacFarlane Building (which later became the Stegmaier brewery, which in turn became the Golden Quality ice cream store and factory). In July 1865, the bank moved across the street to the corner of Girard and Main streets and for the next fifty years operated on that site out of a simple <a href="Italianate">Italianate</a> building which it shared with a separate residence.

Incorporation of Plymouth Borough
What is now Plymouth Borough was originally a part of <a href="Plymouth%20Township%2C%20Luzerne%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plymouth Township</a>. Plymouth Borough was incorporated in April 1866. According to Samuel L. French, author of "Reminiscences of Plymouth, Luzerne County, Penna.", "...the present Borough of Plymouth was erected by decree of Honorable John N. Conyngham, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, on the 23rd day of April, A. D., 1866, upon the recommendation of the Grand Jury..."

The boundaries of the new borough extended from the line of the No. 11 Lance Coal Breaker on the east to Driscoll Street on the west, about a mile and a half; and from the river on the south to near the foot of the mountain on the north. When first created, the borough was divided into two wards, east and west, the dividing line being Academy Street. Later, these two wards were sub-divided into additional wards. After incorporation, the borough elections were held in the Old Academy where the township elections had previously been held. The first borough election was held in May 1866. Oliver Davenport was judge of the election, and John J. Shonk and Ira Davenport were inspectors. Elijah C. Wadhams was elected as the borough's first Burgess.

Welsh, English, Scottish, and Irish immigration

In the wake of the arrival of the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad in 1857, a large number of <a href="immigrant">immigrant</a>s came to Plymouth to work in the <a href="coal%20mine">coal mine</a>s and, as the population grew, it became more diverse. According to the 1860 census, Plymouth Township had 2,393 residents. Of these, 75% were born in Pennsylvania. Among the other 25% a small number were foreign born: 246 in Ireland, 78 in Wales, 53 in England, 49 in Scotland, and 37 in Germany.

By the time of the 1870 census, the population had grown to 7,736, including 807 born in Ireland, 926 born in Wales, and 713 born in England. In addition to these newcomers, there were 138 Scots, 52 Germans, 39 <a href="Canadians">Canadians</a>, 5 French, and 1 Norwegian. Moreover, many of the 4,635 Pennsylvania-born residents were the children of these immigrants. By 1870, roughly 75% of the town's population was either foreign-born, or the children of foreign-born parents.

Along with these new immigrants and the rapid increase in the population, came an inevitable change in character of the town from a sleepy agrarian village to a rough and tumble mining town. In the mid-1870s, there were numerous crimes and atrocities (often labor related) attributed to Irish secret societies, collectively known as the <a href="Molly%20Maguires">Molly Maguires</a>. A few of these incidents occurred in Plymouth, including shootings and anonymous death threats. As an example, on February 10, 1875, the "Plymouth Weekly Star" published a threatening letter, or "coffin notice", which included the demand that the recipient leave town or else be killed:
A gentleman in the employ of one of our prominent merchants has received the following letter:

"Plymouth, Feby 1, 1875, Mr. ____: youre Days is numbered in Plymouth we will guve you 24 hours to lave and if you don’t lave in that time dath will be youre dom. Leave leav you blackleg ____. No more from me at pres. M. MacGuire.
Mr. Barthe, editor of the "Star", wrote that "the letter is ornamented with a coffin, skull, cross-bone, pistol & dagger. A reward will be paid to any person introducing the writer of the above." Samuel L. French, who was Burgess of Plymouth when this letter was published, mentioned the Molly Maguires in his history, "Reminiscences of Plymouth, Pa.", writing that "one of their number named Dunleavy was mysteriously shot one evening in a saloon on East Main Street, which incident had the effect of putting a quietus on the band in Plymouth."

In addition to quarrels between newly arrived immigrants and the established order, quarrels often arose among the immigrant groups themselves. These were sometimes personal in nature. "The Philadelphia Inquirer", on February 25, 1881, reported one such incident between two mineworkers, one Welsh, the other Irish.
"In a quarrel between James Kelly, a car runner, and A. D. Williams, a miner, at the Nottingham mine, Plymouth, today, the latter struck Kelly a terrible blow with a heavy piece of wood knocking him senseless. The wounded man was taken home and died in the afternoon. Williams was arrested. The quarrel arose out of the division of cars of which Kelly had charge."
The influx of immigrants from the British Isles led to the construction of several new buildings, including St. Vincent's church for the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> congregation, St. Peter's for the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Anglicans</a>, the <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> church for a largely Scottish congregation and several new churches for a variety of Welsh congregations.

The Avondale Mine Disaster
The Avondale Mine Disaster occurred on September 6, 1869, when 108 men and boys died at the <a href="Avondale%20Colliery">Avondale Colliery</a>, located just west of the Plymouth borough line. A fire in the mine shaft, ignited by a ventilating furnace, spread to the <a href="coal%20breaker">breaker</a> which stood over the shaft. The breaker was destroyed by fire, trapping those working in the mine below. All were killed, as were two men who volunteered to enter the mine soon after the fire. One result of the disaster was the enactment in 1870 of a law regulating mining which required employment by the State of mine inspectors, the mapping of all mine works, the creation of two means of egress from every mine, provision for proper ventilation, reporting and investigation of all accidents and the establishment of rules of conduct for employees.

1873 Beers Map

The Plymouth, Pa. Beers map is taken from an atlas of Luzerne County cities, towns, and townships, prepared by D.G. Beers and published in Philadelphia in 1873. The Beers map provides detailed information about the town as it stood fifteen years after the railroad arrived, eight years after the end of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, and seven years after Plymouth Borough was created out of Plymouth Township.

The map illustrates the division of the town into two wards, east and west of Academy Street.

Labor troubles

A bank panic on September 18, 1873, led to a prolonged national depression, and by 1877 there were about three million unemployed, roughly 25 percent of the working population. These circumstances led to the outbreak known as the <a href="Great%20Railroad%20Strike%20of%201877">Great Railroad Strike of 1877</a>. It was the first nationwide strike, one in which Plymouth played a small but interesting part.

The strike began in June 1877 when the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> cut wages by 10 percent. The following month it announced that all eastbound trains from <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> would be doubled in size without any increase in the size of crews. Railroad workers declared a strike, took control of switches and blocked the movement of trains. Meanwhile, on July 13, the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> cut wages, and on July 16 the railroad's firemen and brakemen refused to work. A sympathy strike broke out in Pittsburgh, and troops were sent from Philadelphia. When the troops were confronted by strikers, they fired into the crowd, killing twenty and wounding twenty-nine. Workers broke into a gun factory and seized rifles and small arms and exchanged gunfire with the soldiers throughout the night. On July 22, <a href="Governor%20of%20Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania's governor</a> ordered every militia regiment in the state to report for duty. Samuel L. French, Plymouth's Burgess at the time, recalled,
"In July, 1877, almost immediately succeeding the peaceful enjoyments incident to the centennial celebration of our national independence, the country was startled at the outbreak of very serious rioting by the railroad employees of Pittsburgh. These outbreaks of lawlessness, like an epidemic of a contagious disease, rapidly spread over near the entire state. Railroad traffic was for a time interrupted, employees being assaulted and engines and cars demolished. Local authorities were utterly unable to cope with the situation."

A national strike was on all over the country. On July 25, a general strike was called in northeastern Pennsylvania on the <a href="Delaware%20and%20Hudson%20Railroad">Delaware and Hudson Railroad</a> and the <a href="Delaware%2C%20Lackawanna%20and%20Western%20Railroad">Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad</a> (the line that ran through Plymouth). The mine workers employed by these railroads (many from Plymouth) struck as well. On August 2, three thousand state <a href="militia">militia</a> troops arrived in the <a href="Wyoming%20Valley">Wyoming Valley</a>. Samuel L. French wrote,
"The miners in the anthracite regions of Schuylkill and Luzerne and Lackawanna counties were at the time on strike and soon became infected. A demon like spirit seemed to pervade the masses. In Scranton, Mayor McKune had been violently assaulted, and a posse of the leading citizens had fired upon and killed several of the rioters. A passenger train on the L&B R.R., arriving at Plymouth from Northumberland in the evening was stoned and the train obliged to remain on the siding at the depot. I was Burgess at the time and a committee of representative citizens reported to me, their fears of contemplated incendiarism against certain of the properties located here and connected with mining industries, and requested me to officially invoke protection from the State. I telegraphed the State authorities and soon thereafter a regiment of soldiers was in possession of the town."

"...Brigadier General E. W. Matthews, a former school teacher in Plymouth, was in charge of the troops which invaded the town. In front of the engine of the train which carried the troops was placed a gun, and at Nanticoke several companies were disembarked, and as skirmishers, during the night, proceeded up the road, taking into custody every man caught out of doors. Near a hundred of these night prowlers were thus captured, quite a number in Plymouth, some of whom were carried to Scranton, there to give an account of their actions. The troops remained stationed here, and in the locality for several weeks, the staff officers using the stalled railroad cars for their headquarters."

Polish, Lithuanian, and Slovakian immigration

By 1880, a new mix was added to the population of Plymouth with the arrival of immigrants from <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>. These were welcomed by the mining companies because they worked for low wages, and thus undercut the bargaining power of the increasingly organized Irish and Welsh miners. In the 1880 census, only 86 of Plymouth's residents were born in Poland, 25 in <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, 9 in Hungary, 8 in Austria, and 2 in Russia. Most likely they were all ethnically <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>n, <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>n, and Polish.

In 1885, during Plymouth's great <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> epidemic, it was implied (incorrectly) in the press that the epidemic was caused by the new immigrants' unsanitary living conditions. In fact, the disease was caused by contamination of the town's water supply by the careless behavior of a typhoid-stricken <a href="dairy">dairy</a> farmer living near the town's water system. Ironically, because some of the immigrants lived at the lower end of town (and therefore happened to live close to the source of the water supply), they suffered disproportionately from the tainted water. As they grew ill, their neighbors took notice and the plague was quickly attributed to them and their crowded quarters. Furthermore, the town fathers were blamed for allowing such lax conditions. In June 1885, a reporter for "The Philadelphia Inquirer" wrote:
"The situation at Plymouth is about the same as it has been for a week past. The Hungarian settlement in the lower part of the town is reported to be in a wretched condition. The inhabitants of this colony live huddled together in filth, and it has been made known that as many as twenty persons live — eating, sleeping and cooking — in one room. They refuse to make known to the Relief Committee the number of sick among them. Steps will be taken at once to compel them to live in a different way or to leave the town."
The new immigrants were unwilling (or perhaps unable) to cooperate with the Relief Committee: among the list of 1,153 victims treated at the makeshift hospital in the Central High School, prepared by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Health">Pennsylvania Department of Health</a>, no names of Eastern European derivation are listed.

Like most immigrants, many of the new arrivals were poor and uneducated and, at first, spoke little or no English. They were referred to in the press as "foreigners" and during the early years of their arrival were often made to feel unwelcome. Their function as strike-breakers added to their unpopularity. On February 26, 1890, "The Philadelphia Inquirer" reported:
"The Poles and Hungarians who live in such numbers in Plymouth and vicinity promise to be speedily cleared out. At different times before several hundred have been shipped away to fill the strikers place at <a href="Punxsutawney%2C%20Pennsylvania">Punxsutawney</a> by the agents of the company who are circulating throughout this region and today 300 more were sent off in a special train. They left on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad at 11 o'clock, many of them accompanied by their wives and children and carrying a most miscellaneous collection of goods with them. Each man was supplied with a bottle of whiskey, a big paper of tobacco, and a ticket to Punxsutawney. Another batch is being raised and will leave Plymouth in a day or two."
While some of the Eastern European immigrants were transitory, many more came to Plymouth and stayed, eventually forming a large and important part of the population. By 1890, Plymouth boasted three Roman Catholic churches with Eastern European congregations, St. Mary's (Polish), St. Stephen's (Slovakian), and St. Casimir's (Lithuanian). By the 1920s, these three groups were said to represent 40% of the town's population.

The First Central High School
The first Central High School was built in 1884 by Samuel Livingston French and his Plymouth Planing Mill Co. The school saw its first graduating class in 1886, but was destroyed by fire in February 1905. According to the February 24, 1905 edition of the "Wilkes-Barre Times":
"A serious fire occurred at Plymouth this morning at 12:30, when the Plymouth Central high school was so badly gutted and damaged that it will have to be re-built. The building is located on Shawnee Avenue, only a short distance from the busiest section of that town, it being about 1,300 feet from the Pioneer and Wyoming Valley knitting mills and Shawnee box factory. The fire was discovered at 12:30 and an alarm was rung from Box 26 calling out the entire fire department which quickly responded, but the blaze had gained considerable headway and a sheet of flames could be seen issuing from the top of the building."

"The origin is a mystery. The building is heated by steam supplied by the Parrish Coal Company. There was no fire in the building whatsoever ... Ambrose West's handsome residence, against the building on the west side, and a double block owned and occupied by Daniel R. Davis, against the building on the east side, were in danger, but the firemen confined the blaze within the brick walls of the burning building."

"The higher branches were taught in this building and a large class was to graduate this year. There were 400 pupils attending school there under the instructions of eight teachers. The building was used as a hospital in 1885 when the typhoid epidemic visited that town and scores of people died of the malady . . . At a meeting of Fire Co. No. 1 held at 4 o’clock, a resolution was passed offering the use of the company parlors for a school . . . a number of trustees of the several churches have also offered the use of their church basements for the use of school purposes and it is thought by Monday that matters will be arranged so that all the scholars will be provided with a place to continue their studies."

The Typhoid Epidemic of 1885

The Typhoid Epidemic of 1885 was caused by contamination of the town's water supply. Like the Avondale Mine Disaster of 1869, it aroused the sympathy of the entire nation. The epidemic was eventually traced to a dairy farmer who lived on Mountain Road alongside Coal Creek, the stream that fed the town's water supply. During the Christmas holiday in 1884, he visited his brother, the owner of a cigar store in Philadelphia, and returned home in January ill with typhoid. During his weeks of recuperation, the snow on the ground around his farmhouse became contaminated. At the same time, the water company's reservoirs had become so low, that the company began to pump water, as a substitute source, from the Susquehanna River.

In late March, the weather began to warm and the snow began to melt, so that the stream and one of its reservoirs (known as the Third Water Dam) became contaminated. Furthermore, because of the melting snow, the reservoir began to fill. Hoping to stop pumping river water, the water company's superintendent lit a fire at the exit pipe of the reservoir, allowing water to flow freely downstream and contaminate the town's water supply.

By the week of April 12, between 50-100 new cases were reported daily. By September, 1,104 cases were recorded (out of a population of just over 8,000), including 713 in April, 261 in May, 83 in June, 31 in July, 15 in August and 1 in September. Taking into account unreported cases, the number was probably much higher.

Dr. Morris Stroud French was a physician in Philadelphia at the time of the epidemic, one of several sent to Plymouth to set up a temporary hospital in the Central High School building. After the epidemic, French prepared a report of the hospital's activities, listing all the patients who were treated, the ward where they lived, the length and cost of their treatment, and, when applicable, the date of their death. French recorded 1,153 victims, of whom 114 died. He estimated the cost of the epidemic, including the cost of treatment and lost wages, at about $100,000.

Martin Wilkes and the Polish–Lithuanian Church War

By the time that the 1887 <a href="city%20directory">city directory</a> was published, there were three Roman Catholic congregations in Plymouth: "St. Vincent's Catholic Church", for "English-speaking" (mostly Irish) Catholics, "St. Stephen's Hungarian Catholic Church", (for Slovakians), and "St. Mary's Polish Catholic Church" (for Poles and Lithuanians). St. Mary's congregation was founded in the spring of 1885. The trustees purchased land on Willow Street and built a small wooden church (on the site of the later school building). Although the Poles and Lithuanians spoke different languages, their histories were intertwined, and the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Scranton">Diocese of Scranton</a> assumed the two groups would amicably share the same church and cemetery so long as their parish priest was fluent in both languages. As it turned out, there was an animosity between them. In 1889–1890, these feelings were inflamed by an outspoken parishioner named Martin Wilkes, who came to be known in the national press as "the Polish King". Wilkes was born in Poland and immigrated to the United States in 1873. By the time of the 1880 census, he was working as a coal miner, living in <a href="West%20Nanticoke%2C%20Pennsylvania">West Nanticoke</a>, and by 1889, he had acquired a saloon, gained a small following and proclaimed himself leader of the Poles in Plymouth.

St. Mary's congregation's first priest was Polish. But after he departed, trouble arose when the Diocese of Scranton appointed, not once, but twice, a Lithuanian priest to St. Mary's. The Poles objected on the grounds that their greater number, earlier arrival and greater financial contribution entitled them to preference. The second Lithuanian priest, Father Alexandras Burba, was appointed to St. Mary's on August 22, 1889. Burba spoke Polish and Lithuanian, but was an ardent Lithuanian nationalist; the Polish trustees allowed him to celebrate mass in the church but refused to give him possession of the parsonage. On October 22, Bishop O'Hara arrived from Scranton and sent Father Mack (of the St. Vincent's congregation) to gain access to the parsonage, but when he knocked on the door, he was "met by three guns pointing at him from an upstairs window."

Next, Father Mack went to the Town Hall and got warrants for the arrest of the rebel faction, after which the police arrested three of them. When the rebels reached the town lock-up (in an effort to rescue the prisoners), they encountered constable Michael Melvin and in the ensuing scuffle broke his leg. According to "The Philadelphia Inquirer", "Thousands of people collected on Main Street ... There was some strong talk about lynching Martin Wilkes, the Polish leader. He was finally arrested and lodged in jail. The Polanders still hold possession of the priest's house tonight. The Burgess says he will clear every man out tomorrow if he has to make dead men of them all."

After this episode, Father Burba departed St. Mary's, and the split between the two nationalities became permanent, with the Lithuanians forming their own congregation. The war between the Polish faction and the Scranton Diocese settled into a standstill for the Christmas holidays, but in January 1890, war resumed, and this time the focus was the cemetery on Welsh Hill which the Diocese had created for use by both the Poles and the Lithuanians.

On January 20, 1890, a reporter for "The Philadelphia Inquirer" wrote:
"The Polish church war at Plymouth is on again. The church authorities were about congratulating themselves that the difficulty was settled when they were confronted with a new issue ... Friday, the little son of a leader of the Lithuanian faction died, and yesterday afternoon an attempt was made to bury him in the Polish cemetery ... the Poles were on hand when the funeral procession reached the gates of the cemetery. They were armed with guns, and one of them raised his weapon and told the driver of the hearse if he dared to enter the sacred grounds he would be shot on the spot ... The Lithuanians did not expect to meet with an armed body of men and they had nothing to do but retreat, which they did speedily ... A committee of Polanders went to Scranton last night and had an interview with Bishop O'Hara. The latter said the burial must take place tomorrow and he will invoke the aid of the civil authorities. As the Lithuanians will comply with the Bishop's instructions, trouble is looked for."
After the incident at the cemetery, Martin Wilkes was arrested and jailed in Wilkes-Barre and released on bail. Once released, he swore vengeance against the Lithuanians. According to the "Philadelphia Inquirer", "When Wilkes reached his home in Plymouth, he at once proceeded to carry out his threats. He summoned about twenty of his devoted followers, and arming themselves with shovels and pickaxes, the party left for the cemetery ... arriving there they opened the graves of the two Lithuanian children buried yesterday. The coffins were thrown over the fence onto an adjoining field. One of the bodies was badly lacerated. The pick axes had been driven through it in several places ... The Lithuanians are gunning for Wilkes. They say they will shoot him on sight."

After the incident at the cemetery, Wilkes and seven associates were arrested and taken before Justice Donahue. They were charged with forcible entry, detainer of a cemetery, violating a sepulcher, resisting public officers, felonious shooting, surety of the peace, riot, and affray. In February, Bishop O'Hara installed a Polish priest at St. Mary's, Father S. F. Szymanowski. Wilkes's first encounter with the feisty Father Szymanowski was to be his last, as "The Philadelphia Inquirer" reported on February 21:
"...This evening Wilkes and a half dozen of his followers went to Father Szymanowski's residence. They were received pleasantly by the pastor. Wilkes stated his mission, demanding that the priest surrender the church books, give up the keys of the house and vacate the premises. Before the visitors were aware of it, the priest reached to a bureau drawer, pulled out a revolver, and pointing at the men said: 'Now you fellows have made trouble enough in this congregation. I will have you understand this is my house and I want you to get out at once or I will compel you to.' Wilkes didn't wait to hear any more. He and his party fled. Wilkes and his followers now threaten to burn the building. The priest has stationed himself at the window up stairs, revolver in hand."
On April 26, according to "The Philadelphia Inquirer", Martin Wilkes was "convicted of aggravated assault and battery on Constable [Michael] Melvin. There were eight other indictments against the prisoner." Wilkes served one and a half years in prison. Meanwhile, the Lithuanians had begun to build their own church, completed in December 1890, as well as their own cemetery. Life returned to normal for the Polish congregation, and it no longer appeared in the news. As for Wilkes, he appeared in the newspapers one last time. Having served his sentence, he attempted to obtain a liquor license in Scranton. But Bishop O'Hara had a long memory, and took steps to have the application denied, and thereby managed to have the last word. On April 24, 1890, the "Wilkes-Barre Times", published the following account:
"Many people will recall Martin Wilkes, who created a great deal of trouble among the Polish residents at Plymouth two or three years ago. An effort was made yesterday in the Lackawanna courts to have the license of a successful applicant transferred to Wilkes, but it seems the latter's bad reputation has followed him from Plymouth to Scranton, for the transfer was opposed by Joseph O’Brien, Esq., who was supposed to represent Bishop O’Hara in the case although the identity of his client was not made known. He called George Smith, formerly of Plymouth, who testified that Wilkes kept a place in Plymouth, the reputation of which was bad and that he was refused a license by the Luzerne County court two years ago. He also stated that Wilkes was one of the principals in the Polish church riot and that he ordered Bishop O’Hara out of the house; that he was indicted for selling liquor on Sunday, and that the chief of police had his leg broken while making an arrest in his place. Judge Archibald refused to grant the transfer."
The electric railway and the Carey Avenue Bridge

The Plymouth Street Railway was incorporated on May 14, 1889, and in 1891 its directors built an <a href="electric%20railway">electric railway</a>, or <a href="tram">trolley line</a>, down the middle of Plymouth's Main Street, running from the east end of the borough to a turn-around at the west end of town. That same year, the line was extended along the north side of Ross Hill to <a href="Edwardsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Edwardsville</a>, where transfers could be made to a similar railway that ran across the Market Street Bridge to Wilkes-Barre. When the Plymouth Street Railway was complete, the Wilkes-Barre & Wyoming Valley Traction Co. leased it and operated it along with several other trolley lines. After the Carey Avenue Bridge was completed in the spring of 1895, the Wilkes-Barre & Wyoming Valley Traction Co. built a second railway line across the bridge, providing a second, more direct route to Wilkes-Barre's public square.

Ultimately, the network included the boroughs and townships of <a href="Ashley%2C%20Pennsylvania">Ashley</a>, <a href="Courtdale%2C%20Pennsylvania">Courtdale</a>, Edwardsville, <a href="Forty%20Fort%2C%20Pennsylvania">Forty Fort</a>, <a href="Hanover%20Township%2C%20Luzerne%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Hanover</a>, <a href="Kingston%2C%20Pennsylvania">Kingston</a>, <a href="Larksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Larksville</a>, Miners Mills, <a href="Nanticoke%2C%20Pennsylvania">Nanticoke</a>, Parsons, <a href="Pittston%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittston</a>, <a href="Plains%20Township%2C%20Luzerne%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plains</a>, Plymouth, <a href="Sugar%20Notch%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sugar Notch</a>, <a href="West%20Pittston%2C%20Pennsylvania">West Pittston</a>, <a href="West%20Wyoming%2C%20Pennsylvania">West Wyoming</a>, <a href="Wilkes-Barre%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wilkes-Barre</a>, and <a href="Wyoming%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wyoming</a>. The trolley cars ran until the 1950s and were an important amenity, making it easier for residents to go to work, to shop, to visit friends and relatives, and to spend time at new amusement parks that sprung up along the lines, including Sans Souci Park, located between Nanticoke and Wilkes-Barre.

The Spanish–American War

In 1898, the Ninth Regiment, a state <a href="militia">militia</a> organization founded in 1879 and headquartered in Wilkes-Barre, volunteered to serve in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">war with Spain</a>. On April 27, 1898, two days after Spain declared war, the various companies that formed the regiment (including Plymouth's Company I) met at the Wilkes-Barre armory and marched to the Lehigh Valley railroad station. Enthusiasm for the war was at a high point, and it was estimated that 130,000 people gathered to see the troops off. In May, they made camp at <a href="Chickamauga%20Park%2C%20Georgia">Chickamauga Park, Georgia</a>, where in July an outbreak of typhoid occurred with roughly half of the 1,300 troops contracting the disease, from which 29 men died. The war ended on August 12 while the Ninth Regiment was still camped in Georgia, and on September 19 the regiment returned to Wilkes-Barre. Plymouth's Company I was led by Capt. Harry W. Pierce, First Lieut. Adnah McDaniel, Second Lieut. William F. Powell, First Sergeant George W. Kostenbauder and Quartermaster Sergeant John May. The musicians were John T. Hayward and George N. Van Loon.

The start of the 20th century

December 31, 1900, was the last day of the 19th century. That morning John Kinney, an old man who came from <a href="Tipperary">Tipperary</a> decades before, and Margaret Carey, an infant, were both buried in the Welsh Hill cemetery. William Cleary, the town's correspondent for the "Wilkes-Barre Times", and his betrothed, Mary Lynch, made preparations for their upcoming wedding. That evening, the married couples on Welsh Hill held a New Year reception at Owen's Hall, featuring an "old time" hoop dance. Andy Brennan, the Master of Ceremonies, joked that the new century was the last any of them would ever see. The Plymouth Band performed dance music at the Plymouth Armory, while professor William Lewis's choir performed a midnight High Mass at St. Vincent's church (Nora Heffernan, Margaret Gallagher and John Ryan were the soloists and Joseph Flaherty the organist). On New Year's Day, the Ebenezer Baptist Church held an extended service including a roll call of the members, a song service led by Mary Philips, a student at the Philadelphia Bible Institute, and a <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance</a> address for the children. At Duffy's Hall, the Plymouth Athletic Association held a series of boxing matches. In the grand finale, Hayden from Wilkes-Barre fought three rounds against Wilson of <a href="Danville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Danville</a>, the latter described in the newspapers as the "dark wonder." For those who wanted to memorialize themselves at the beginning of the new century, James Beacham, Plymouth's talented photographer, opened his studio for portraits.

Those who had lived in Plymouth during the previous forty years had much to recall. During that time, Plymouth had nearly reached its ultimate state. Virtually all the streets that would ever be created were now in place, and most of the houses, churches and commercial buildings that would ever be built had now been built. Plymouth's coal mines were established and consolidated in the hands of a small number of operators, and its water system, telegraph and telephone service, electrical lines and gas pipes were fully developed. A trolley system connected the residents to all of the neighboring towns and cities. The next 29 years would be mostly prosperous ones during which the town's residents would enjoy the bounty of the years of industrial growth. Coal production would grow and the population steadily increase in size and wealth. One of the problems that this increase presented was the need to build sufficient school buildings to accommodate the growing population, and the growing number of families who could now afford to send their children to school, rather than to work in the mines.

Years of prosperity (1901–1929).
The Great Flood of 1902

One of the most destructive floods in the history of the Wyoming Valley occurred on Sunday, March 2, 1902, when the waters of the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a> rose and flooded a vast developed area. It was the largest flood since the Great Flood of 1865. Eight deaths were reported in Wilkes-Barre. The temperature suddenly rose, and snow which had covered much of the Susquehanna's watershed melted. At the same time, more than of rain fell within a short period. The combined melted snow and rain caused the river to rise rapidly and the ice to break on February 28. All day Saturday, March 1, the river rose, until Sunday when it crested at above the low water mark.

Wyoming Valley had experienced less extensive flooding a few months earlier, on December 15, 1901, and therefore, residents were more prepared than they might have been. In Plymouth, water covered the streets closest to the river and surrounded or flooded many houses. The railroads were damaged, bridges were swept away and great portions of roadbeds washed out. Wyoming Valley's street car system was paralyzed, and it was a few weeks before cars were run regularly.

Plymouth recovered quickly from the 1902 flood. On March 6, trains began running on schedule to Scranton on the <a href="Delaware%2C%20Lackawanna%20%26amp%3B%20Western%20Railroad">Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad</a>. And by March 8, the first street car arrived in town from Edwardsville. The West family set up an electric pump on Main Street and began pumping out flooded cellars for the town's businessmen. Capt. Theodore Renshaw went to Peter Shupp's old house on Center Avenue and measured the flood's high-water mark and found it to be at street curb level. Renshaw recalled that the 1865 flood had risen above the floor of Shupp's residence, and calculated that the 1865 flood had been 2'-9" higher than the 1902 flood.

The second Central High School

The architect of the second Central High School was <a href="Harry%20Livingston%20French">Harry Livingston French</a>. In 1905, when French was awarded the commission to design the new school, he was already well known to the Plymouth school board: French was a native of Plymouth, descended from an old and distinguished family. In 1900, when the school board commissioned him to design alterations to the Franklin Street School, Harry French had been an architect for only a few years. He graduated from <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> in 1894, but soon after left for <a href="Meeker%2C%20Colorado">Meeker, Colorado</a>, where his brother practiced medicine. French spent sixteen months in Meeker, returning east in the beginning of 1897. By April 1899, his firm, McCormick & French, had won third place in the design competition for the new <a href="Luzerne%20County%20Courthouse">Luzerne County Courthouse</a>. For their efforts, they received a prize of $300. However, in 1905, architect F. J. Osterling of Pittsburgh, the winner of the competition, was forced to resign in the middle of construction. He was replaced by McCormick & French.

Harry French inherited numerous social, business and political connections — his father was Samuel Livingston French, born in Plymouth on September 8, 1839, a great-grandson of Noah Wadhams, Plymouth's illustrious 18th century preacher. Samuel L. French was a veteran of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, having served in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> from 1861 to 1862. Afterwards, he was a politically active <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>. In 1872, he was elected Register of Wills for Luzerne County, and in 1874, became the first clerk of the Orphans' Court. In 1875, he was elected to the first of several terms as Burgess of Plymouth, and held that office during the great labor troubles of 1877. Samuel L. French was also an amateur historian — he wrote a book about the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>, and in 1915 published "Reminiscences of Plymouth", his homage to the antebellum years of his hometown.

In 1880, Samuel L. French became a retail lumber dealer, founding the Plymouth Planing Mill Company, which he ran until 1902. It was this company which built the old Central High School in 1884. The old school, and the new one that replaced it, sat on a bluff overlooking the Parrish Colliery of the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. Both school and colliery sat on land that once was part of the Wadhams estate. After the fire, the school board must have engaged McCormick and French immediately, for it was only one month after the fire that the board met to announce that the architects' plans were accepted, plans for a much larger building than the original. On March 23, 1905, the "Wilkes-Barre Times" reported:
"At a special meeting of the school board held last evening in the office of the secretary, J. A. Opp, held for the purpose of adopting the plans and specifications of the proposed new school building, which is to take the place of the building which was burned down on February 24, it was decided to accept the plans that had been prepared by McCormick and French. The plans are for a building of sixteen rooms, which is twice the size of the old building, and it will be a substantial structure, which will be one of the prettiest buildings in town. The secretary was instructed to advertise for bid, and another meeting will be called on April 12 for the purpose of opening the bids and awarding the contract. A motion was unanimously carried that the sale of bonds be held in the office of the secretary on April 10."
On June 1 that year, the class of "nineteen-five" held its commencement exercises. Fourteen students received their diplomas. Charles H. Kaeufer read an eloquent speech entitled "Memorial of the Central Building".
"Workmen have now removed the last traces of the old school. Whatever will remain of the old building in the future is embedded in the minds and hearts of the boys and girls who have come to maturity during the twenty-one years of its usefulness. The shelter which the building has afforded has resulted in the up-building of character and the implanting of healthy sentiments in the boys and girls of Plymouth. The expenditure has not been in vain. The building has been a fortress against ignorance and superstition. Its memory should be cherished lovingly. Patriotism has been infused, industry fostered, and wickedness condemned. Therefore the influence of the building must be ranked among the permanent possessions of the community."
On the following evening, the Plymouth High School Alumni Association held its fourth annual banquet. Mrs. L. S. Smith, one of the "few surviving members" of the first graduating class (1886), spoke of her memories of the old school, a talk that was followed by a musical presentation and a toast given by the future governor of Pennsylvania, Arthur James.

The summer of 1905 came and went as work began on the new school. On August 18, the "Times" reported that "sills were laid for the new Central School house yesterday." On August 26, pupils were ordered to report to Rooms 7 and 8 of the Willow St. School. The class of 1906 would spend the entire school year in temporary quarters, for it was not until Labor Day, September 3, 1906, that the new building was dedicated. The "Wilkes-Barre Times" sent a reporter:
"Plymouth's handsome new High school was dedicated and formally opened to-day with impressive and appropriate exercises amid the cheers of several thousand people. Prior to the exercises at the school there was a grand parade, in which many secret societies from in and out of town took part, together with bands of music ... The parade formed at the corner of Main and Bridge Streets, moved to Davenport, countermarched to Gaylord and thence to the high school where the exercises were held ... "The progress of the public school" was the subject of an eloquent address by J. Q. Creveling, who began by comparing the present school system with that of years gone by when Plymouth and all its institutions were in their infancy. He spoke of the rapid advancement in the education of America's army of children and of the responsibility resting upon the thousands of men and women employed in the work of fitting them to enter upon life's duties."
The event was organized by the <a href="Junior%20Order%20of%20United%20American%20Mechanics">Junior Order of United American Mechanics</a>, perhaps a union representing the men who built the building. The O.U.A.M. presented the school with a new flag as well as a bible for each classroom. The new building served as Plymouth's high school for only seven years, for on Labor Day, September 1913, another parade and dedication exercise took place, this time to celebrate the opening of yet another new high school building — this one on Main Street. After 1913, the 1906 Central High School was used to educate children in the lower grades.

The third high school building

Plymouth's third high school building was dedicated on September 1, 1913, following a large parade through the town. The parade featured the police force, three fire departments, the school directors, school children on floats, various labor unions and several fraternal organizations. At the ceremony, the Central School children sang "March of our Nation", and after the graduates of the class of 1914 raised the flag, the students and audience sang "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>", accompanied by the school's marching band. The chairman of the dedication ceremony was Harold L. Freeman, and the architect of the new building was his brother, New York's Alfred Freeman, a Plymouth native and graduate of Plymouth High School's class of 1892. The building was built by Perkins and Heffernan, and the plumbing work installed by Doyle Brothers, both Plymouth firms.

The building (which was later added onto) had four rooms on the first floor and four on the second floor plus a large study room. The basement was reserved for the cloakrooms, boiler rooms, lavatories and a room for the School Directors.

William B. Cleary, writing in the "Wilkes-Barre Times Leader", noted that "The new school building is located in the central portion of the town, set back sufficiently from the main street to give it an important position and affords an opportunity to make most attractive grounds."

Plymouth's third high school building was demolished in August 2014. Architectural historian (and former attendee) Michael Lewis commented in <a href="http%3A//www.timesleader.com/stories/One-school-MANY-MEMORIES%2C167688%3Fcategory_id%3D371%26amp%3Btown_id%3D1%26amp%3Bsub_type%3Dstories">The Times Leader</a>: "As far as architecture is concerned, the high school is neither original nor innovative. It is simply one of those solid, serviceable and beautifully constructed school buildings built a century ago, when it seemed that America could build durable and efficient public buildings effortlessly."

The First National Bank Building

In 1915, the First National Bank announced plans to construct a new building designed by architect <a href="Harry%20Livingston%20French">Harry Livingston French</a>. It was completed by August 21, 1915, when a reporter for the "Times-Leader" inspected the building and pronounced it satisfactory:
"The handsome new bank building is thirty-four feet wide and eighty feet long, and rests upon a reinforced concrete slab, sixteen inches thick. It is entirely fireproof in all parts of its construction, all floors, partitions and roof being built of steel and cement. The banking room floor is thirty-one feet wide by fifty-nine feet long, and from floor to ceiling is twenty-four feet high. In the front portion, on the right and left sides of the entrance, respectively, are the president's office and the ladies room. Back of the banking room and on each side of the vault, are the paymaster's room, stair hall, locker room, lavatory, and coupon booths."

"In the center of the rear of the working space is the massive vault, the big circular door weighing fifteen and a half tons, and the vestibule sixteen and a half tons, and the heavy steel lining of the vault forty-eight tons, a total of eighty tons, or one hundred and sixty thousand pounds, the back and sides of the steel vault having a heavy reinforced concrete wall outside."
Visitors on opening day were presented with a postcard image of the new building as well as a souvenir medal with an image of the bank on one side, and on the other, the inscription, "we will accept this on deposit for 50 cents if you open a new savings account of $5.00 or more, leaving it in the bank for 12 months and pay 3 per cent compound interest on your savings."

The First World War

The First World War broke out in 1914, but America remained neutral until it declared war on <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> on April 6, 1917. The <a href="Selective%20Service%20Act%20of%201917">Selective Service Act of 1917</a> was passed on May 18, 1917, and by July a lottery was scheduled so that local districts could meet their assigned quotas of men. District 6 (comprising Plymouth and <a href="Larksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Larksville</a> boroughs) was initially required to furnish 154 men, and many more, men and women, would eventually serve. The war ended when an armistice was signed on <a href="November%2011%2C%201918">November 11, 1918</a>, but "Welcome Home" day in Plymouth was not celebrated until June 30, 1919. That day, a parade formed, with the public school students gathering at Wadhams Street, fraternal lodges on Girard Avenue, soldiers and sailors on Gaylord Avenue, the Polish and Slovak societies on Centre Avenue, and Catholic school children on Eno Street. Participants marched up to the Carey Avenue Bridge and back to Gaylord Avenue where they disbanded. Burgess George E. Gwilliam declared the day to be "one of rejoicing with a cessation of all labor", and banned all cars and trolleys from the streets. After the parade, all four movie theaters opened their doors to veterans free of charge.

By the time of the "Welcome Home" parade of 1919, a fundraising drive was underway to erect a monument to the soldiers and sailors who had served in the First World War. A committee was formed, and <a href="George%20Brewster%20%28sculptor%29">George T. Brewster</a> (1862–1943), a sculptor from New York, was engaged. Brewster had studied at the Massachusetts State Normal Art School, and in Paris at the <a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Beaux-Arts">École des Beaux-Arts</a>. Since 1915, he had been busy creating a large number of statues, busts and relief portraits for the <a href="Vicksburg%20National%20Military%20Park">Vicksburg National Military Park</a>. For Plymouth, Brewster prepared a design of two life-size figures, a soldier and sailor, mounted atop a granite base. In the contract, the sculptor agreed not to duplicate the design anywhere in Pennsylvania. The unveiling was scheduled for November 11, 1919, but the work was delayed and funds ran short. The bronze plaque, listing the names of the fallen, was optimistically dated <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a>, 1920. The dedication finally took place on November 11, 1920, two years after the war's end. Schools and mines were closed for the day, and afterward a parade formed, said to be Plymouth's largest ever. The monument still stands and is the principal public work of art in the borough.

The fourth high school building

Plymouth's fourth high school building, designed by the architect Louis Hancock, was completed in 1925 on a site immediately to the west of the third high school (which then became the Junior High School building). The new building cost $203,000 and was dedicated on February 12, 1925. A few weeks before the dedication, a reporter took a tour of the building, writing that:
"After years of anticipation and debate, the new high school represents the achievement of an ideal. It has advanced Plymouth several years ahead of the status formerly held. Allied with the adjacent recreation field, where athletics are carried out, the school is a complete foundry of young manhood and young womanhood, an inspiration to the spirit that has written the name of Plymouth High School upon the top of the roster of public educational institutions."
Many of the town's residents credited school board member Ward P. Davenport for expediting the construction of the school, for attending to its details and for keeping the costs under control. By the time the school was complete, Davenport was in poor health and retreated to <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City</a> to recuperate. Davenport's health did not improve, and the December 1925 issue of the school's newspaper, the "Shawnee Arrow", made note of his death. By the spring of 1926, the school had been renamed Ward P. Davenport High School, and the stone tablet over the front door with the inscription "Plymouth High School" was replaced with one inscribed with Davenport's name.

Years of retrenchment (1930–1972).
Plymouth Post Office

In November 1933, funds were allocated for a new post office building in Plymouth. The allocation was expedited by two Plymouth natives, Michael E. Comerford, the movie-theater owner, who happened to be the regional representative of the recently created <a href="National%20Recovery%20Administration">National Recovery Administration</a>, and Frank C. Walker, Comerford's nephew, a <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a> ally and the NRA's executive secretary. Among the sites suggested by the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce was the east half of the old railroad depot, across Main Street from the Plymouth high school, more or less where the new post office was built. Construction began in January 1935 and the building was dedicated on November 23, 1935. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was an amateur architect who admired early American architecture, and the new building was designed in the <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> style that was especially popular at the time. An addition, undistinguished but sympathetic to the original wing, was built in the 1960s.

The post office's most interesting feature is a <a href="mural">mural</a> installed in 1938 by the noted artist <a href="Jared%20French">Jared Blanford French</a> (1905–1988) entitled "Mealtime, The Early Coal Miners", one of more than 1,200 works of art commissioned by the U.S. Treasury between the years 1934 and 1943 through a program intended to embellish Federal buildings and encourage the arts during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. French's mural and the town's Soldiers and Sailors monument are the two most significant secular public works of art in Plymouth.

The Great Flood of 1936

One of the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a>'s most damaging floods occurred in March 1936. In the <a href="Wyoming%20Valley">Wyoming Valley</a>, the flood waters covered approximately . Property loss in Plymouth Borough alone was estimated to be about $1,000,000. A large number of Plymouth residents were left homeless, and many volunteers responded to help with rescue and relief efforts. These were coordinated from headquarters set up in the Town Hall building. The Vine Street and Franklin Street schools were converted to temporary dormitories, and the Central School served as a makeshift hospital. The town's three fire companies patrolled the flooded areas during the inundation, and afterward did duty pumping out flooded cellars. After the flood waters receded, Atty. Harold L. Freeman and Mrs. John Q. Mask chaired a fund-raising drive to aid families left destitute by the disaster, while Mrs. Ralph Worthington and Mrs. C. C. Groblewski coordinated donations of clothing made by the Red Cross.

The First National Bank's 75th anniversary

In 1940, Plymouth's First National Bank celebrated its 75th anniversary, and published a pamphlet of the town's and the bank's history. The bank began operating in 1865, and following the Civil War, as America's economy grew by leaps and bounds, Plymouth and the First National grew with it. The bank was a success by one important measure: in 1890, deposits stood at $634,210, and by 1926, (the bank's, and the town's, apogee) deposits had grown to $5,498,200. The bank even survived the Great Depression — while deposits declined, in 1940 they were still a respectable $4,720,702.

The pamphlet's authors, glancing back at the difficult economic times of the previous decade, asked and answered the question of the town's future prosperity:
"Does coal remain here in quantities to guarantee a second era of anthracite prosperity? It does. In the final perfection of production and marketing we find that Glen Alden Company has produced 60 to 75 percent of all Plymouth's fuel contribution. Its engineers look forward to another hundred years of operation."
But neither the bank nor Glen Alden's engineers anticipated the impact of two rival energy sources, <a href="petroleum">oil</a> and <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>, both of them cheaper to extract and to ship than anthracite coal. The anthracite industry received a temporary boost during the Second World War, but by the late 1950s, the industry was all but dead, with the exception of some strip mine operations that continued throughout the 1960s.

The pamphlet's authors cited another example of progress, the construction of "great flood dykes, started after the highest of all river rises in 1936 caused millions of dollars of loss." We read of a "dyke system which will shield the community from such disasters as Plymouth and all of Wyoming Valley suffered from water in 1865, 1902, 1904 and 1936." Unfortunately, the <a href="levee">dike</a> system was unable to withstand the <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">flood waters of 1972</a>, which rose higher than those of 1936, washing over the dikes and dealing a severe blow to an already reeling economy.

As for the bank, it survived only thirteen years beyond its anniversary. In 1953, the Wyoming National Bank of Wilkes-Barre acquired all of its assets while continuing to do business in the Plymouth building. The Wyoming National sold the building after the 1972 flood.

The Diamond Jubilee celebration of 1941

In September 1941, seventy-five years after Plymouth was incorporated as a borough, the town began a five-day celebration at Huber Field, including a pageant with the patriotic theme "America on Parade". Like many American towns, Plymouth had an ethnically diverse population, formed largely by the descendants of Irish, Welsh, Polish, Lithuanian and Slovakian immigrants. Patriotism had an important place in the school curriculum, and the generation that was coming of age in 1941 had been educated to think of themselves as Americans first and foremost. After the Grand Finale of the pageant, according to the Jubilee's promotional pamphlet, the audience was "requested to join with the cast and with the Shawnee Choral Society in the singing of our National Anthem."

While the townspeople celebrated, war was raging in Europe and Asia. The ninth scene of the pageant, "Democracy Defended", was described in the Jubilee's pamphlet as a...
"... tableau of "Peace," following the [First] World War — a war which we fought to "end war". It is presented as a tribute to the brave men and courageous women who gave their all so that Democracy might survive, and in the hope that America may continue to remain honorably at Peace."
The prayer for peace went unanswered: the celebration took place two months before the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, when America was drawn once again into war. Many men and women from Plymouth served in the armed forces during the Second World War.

The writers of the Plymouth Diamond Jubilee pamphlet expressed optimism about the future. In the pageant's tenth scene, "American and Plymouth Today", the Diamond Jubilee Queen, Catherine Oldfield (in later years a Plymouth school teacher known as Catherine Bogdon), delivered her address of welcome "attended by boys and girls, young men and women of Plymouth and vicinity." The scene was described as "symbolic of modern youth, keeping step with the times, moving forward in step with current events. They are the men and women of tomorrow — the destiny of America we love will be in their hands." But owing to the decline of the local economy, many of the young men and women in attendance would have to move elsewhere in order to find work.

The Plymouth Diamond Jubilee celebration of 1941 occurred at an interesting time in the town's history. Still vital, and having survived a decade-long economic depression, the town looked forward to a return to its past prosperity. But unbeknown to the populace, a slow and steady decline would soon begin. Because of the collapse of the anthracite coal industry, the town's population, 15,507 in 1940, would decline to 5,951 by the year 2010.

Plymouth centennial celebration

In 1966, the residents of Plymouth celebrated the 100th anniversary of the incorporation of the Borough of Plymouth. The honorary chairman was the Burgess, Edward F. Burns, and the general chairman was Angelo Grasso. The festivities began on June 11, 1966 with the Centennial Ball, held at the Gaylord Avenue Armory, during which Sandy Smith was chosen to be Miss Plymouth Centennial. A week of parades and parties culminated on June 18, Pioneer and Homecoming Day, with the Grand Parade. In between, the Centennial Committee presented at Huber Field "In Olde Shawnee", a fifteen-episode spectacle produced by John B. Rogers Productions of <a href="Fostoria%2C%20Ohio">Fostoria, Ohio</a>. Many residents, church groups, and civic and fraternal groups participated in the Centennial. During Centennial Week, many women donned old-time costumes from colonial days, and many men grew goatees, moustaches and "mutton-chop" side-burns, which by 1966 had been long out of fashion.

School consolidation 1966–1967

The first Plymouth High School graduating class received their diplomas in 1886, and the last graduating class received theirs in 1966. In the fall of 1966, Plymouth's school system merged with the Edwardsville and Larksville schools to become "Plymouth Area High School", one of three divisions in a consolidated school district called "Wyoming Valley West". In the fall of 1967, the Plymouth Area division combined with the other schools in the district to form a single high school in which freshmen and sophomores attended the Plymouth high school building, and juniors and seniors attended the Kingston high school building. Currently, the <a href="Wyoming%20Valley%20West%20High%20School">Wyoming Valley West High School</a> building is located in Plymouth, south of Shawnee Avenue, near the site of the old Central High School, Plymouth's second high school building (1906), which has been demolished. Plymouth's third high school building (1913) still stands and is now the Main Street Elementary Center. Plymouth's fourth high school building (1925), known as the Ward P. Davenport High School, was demolished after the Agnes Flood of 1972.

Agnes Flood

Unlike earlier floods in the Wyoming Valley, most of which were caused by spring freshets, the 1972 flood was caused by bizarre and unusual weather patterns, including heavy rainfall that began in mid-April. In May almost of rain fell, and in June another fell, so that by late June the Susquehanna watershed was becoming saturated. By Wednesday, June 21, <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">tropical storm Agnes</a> arrived and was hovering over the Susquehanna watershed, dropping up to of rain upstream in a single day. All around the valley, signs of trouble loomed: Main Street in <a href="Shavertown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shavertown</a> flooded, <a href="Harveys%20Lake%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harvey's Lake</a> overflowed, Hunstville Dam was full, a bridge washed out in <a href="Towanda%2C%20Pennsylvania">Towanda</a>. But meanwhile, at <a href="Wilkes-Barre%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wilkes-Barre</a> the river height was only above the low water level. Nevertheless, by 10:00 pm that night the river had quietly risen to , causing <a href="United%20States%20civil%20defense">Civil Defense</a> Headquarters in the Luzerne County Courthouse to evacuate. Plymouth residents were ordered to leave their homes by 2:00 am.

By early morning Thursday, June 22, a widespread evacuation of the valley's flood zone was underway. At 6:00 am, water poured through a dike at Plymouth, and one hour later the river reached a height of , rapidly approaching the limit of the valley's dike system. Countless volunteers passed sandbags from hand to hand in a futile effort to raise the dike level and hold back the water, until at 11:00 am, Civil Defense sounded the alarm calling a halt to all efforts on the east side. At 1:00 pm, water came over the dike at <a href="Forty%20Fort%2C%20Pennsylvania">Forty Fort</a>, after which work stopped on the west side as well.

Telephones no longer worked, electricity was no longer available and sewage systems were incapacitated. The absence of refrigeration led to a shortage of food. <a href="Martial%20law">Martial law</a> went into effect as rescue efforts got underway, and thousands of volunteers descended on the valley to assist with the rescue and then the clean-up. Meanwhile, the water rose higher and higher, finally peaking at at 7:00 pm, Saturday, June 24. At its greatest extent the flood was wide and long. Eventually, the water receded, leaving behind 25,000 homeless residents, and acres of devastation and mud.

On April 20, 1903, acting as Burgess, Thomas shot and killed a mad dog on Main Street. He was tried for <a href="extortion">extortion</a> in connection with a peddler's license that he had issued, a somewhat frivolous charge prosecuted by the peddler, and was acquitted on June 19, 1903. One of his last acts as Burgess was to sign on February 13, 1906, an ordinance creating a regular police force in the borough. On January 25, 1913, when no longer Burgess, Thomas shot and killed his son William, a veteran of the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>. The shooting occurred on Main Street. Thomas was defended by H. L. Freeman and future governor Arthur H. James. He testified in his own defense, claimed the shooting was accidental and was acquitted by a jury on April 10.

Morgan Bevan was born in Wales about 1850, the son of John M. and Elizabeth Bevan. In 1887, Bevan lived with his parents at 30 Ridge (now Cambria) Street. The father died in 1890. In 1900, Morgan Bevan was a bachelor, living with his mother on Cameron Street, working as a "medical salesman" selling <a href="patent%20medicine">patent medicine</a>s. He was elected Burgess as a Republican on February 20, 1906, defeating Bernard Feenan, the Independent candidate, John Jones, the Citizen's party candidate, and Stephen Cusma, the Workingman's and Roosevelt candidate.

David D. Morris (also known as W.D. Morris) was born in Wales about 1847. He was said to have been a veteran of the Civil War. He lost the Republican primary on January 23, 1909 to Thomas Evans. There was so little interest in the Democratic primary that no record was kept, so Morris claimed to have won it in order to stay in the race. In the end, he ran on the Citizens ticket. His campaign was managed by future governor Arthur H. James and was considered to be unusually well run. In the general election held on February 16, Morris drew 1,317 votes to Evans' 989 and became Plymouth's nineteenth Burgess. In February 1911, Burgess Morris ordered all of Plymouth's businesses to close during the funeral services for Rev. T. J. Donahue, the rector of St. Vincent's church. On July 4, 1911, Morris presided over the grand opening of a playground at Cherry Street on the grounds of the Gaylord colliery, donated to the town by the Kingston Coal Co. In July 1912, Morris made national news when he arrested 30 <a href="hobo">hobo</a>es who were loitering in Plymouth, and arranged for them to compete in a baseball game. The losers were arrested and taken to the town lock-up, whereas the winners were given a free dinner and made to leave town. On January 6, 1914, Morris submitted his final monthly report for December 1913 to the town council. Morris was buried in the Shawnee Cemetery with military honors on Memorial Day, 1919.

Samuel U. Shaffer began his political career as Borough clerk in 1879, when Samuel L. French was Burgess.

Shaffer died on March 19, 1929 and is buried in Shawnee Cemetery, Plymouth, Pa.

George E. Gwilliam was born in Pennsylvania in 1883, the son of Welsh-born parents George and Annie Gwilliam. The mother emigrated to the United States in 1854; the father in 1865. Relatively prosperous by 1900, the father owned an insurance agency, while his son, sixteen years old, had the luxury of being "at school" rather than at work in the coal mines. By 1908, George E. Gwilliam had followed his father into the insurance business. In the primary election on September 19, 1917, Gwilliam won both the Republican and Democratic nominations defeating William E. Smith, Thomas Close, William D. Morris and Gomer Reese. Gwilliam won the general election on November 6, 1917 and served as Plymouth's twenty-first Burgess from 1918–1925. He was a fervent Prohibitionist and in August 1920 ordered the saloons of Plymouth to close on Sundays. After he retired as Burgess, Gwilliam remained active in politics and in November 1927 was elected Luzerne County Recorder of Deeds.
William E. "Billy" Smith was born in Wales about 1880, and migrated to the United States with his parents in 1881. As a young man he lost a leg when he leaped from the balcony of the Plymouth Armory. From at least 1908 until 1915, he ran a pool hall and cigar store on Main Street. In 1917, Smith ran unsuccessfully for Burgess. In 1922, he was a Justice of the Peace. In November 1925, Smith ran against John Boney, a Democrat, and Sephaniah Reese, an Independent candidate. Boney, considered a Republican running as a Democrat, did not really campaign and on November 3, 1925, Smith won by a large margin. In October 1933, at the end of his second term, Smith fell ill and Joseph Bialogowicz, a Borough Council member, acted as Burgess. Smith died on October 21, 1933 and for a short time there was a move to appoint his widow Burgess (she would have become Plymouth's first female Burgess) and give her the Democratic and Republican nominations in the November general election, but the appointment and the nominations were given to Charles W. Honeywell instead. To his credit, Honeywell gave his salary for the remainder of Smith's term to Smith's wife. Smith is buried in Fern Knoll Cemetery, Dallas, Pa.

Charles W. Honeywell was born about 1858, probably in <a href="Exeter%20Township%2C%20Luzerne%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Exeter Township, Pennsylvania</a>, the son of Daniel D. and Julia Ann Honeywell. In 1860, the father was a farmer. By 1880, the family lived at Plymouth where the father worked as a shoemaker, and Charles, now 22, worked in a brickyard. In 1887, Honeywell was employed as a manager for J.E. Coursen, owner of a general store, but also employed by the Plymouth Police Department. By 1891, Honeywell was a constable, tax collector and insurance agent with offices at 34 East Main Street. After a long career as a Justice of the Peace, Honeywell became Burgess in October 1933 upon the death of William E. Smith. Smith had won both the Democratic and Republican nominations, and was replaced by Honeywell on both tickets after his death, by agreement of both parties. Owing to poor health, Honeywell served one term and resigned as Burgess in December 1937. Upon his resignation, he was replaced by Samuel J. Brokenshire. Honeywell died on December 28, 1937 and is buried in Hanover Green Cemetery, Hanover Township, Pa.

Samuel John Brokenshire was the last of Plymouth's Cornish-Welsh-born Burgesses. He was born at <a href="Redruth">Redruth</a>, Cornwall, England in 1872, the son of Samuel Brokenshire and his wife, Wilmot Opie, and migrated to the United States sometime between 1874 and 1885. The family settled on Palmer Street near the corner of Jeanette Street, a popular neighborhood for newly arrived Welsh and English immigrants. Samuel Brokenshire Sr. died at Plymouth on July 1, 1888, age 46. In 1891, Samuel Jr. was employed as a driver, boarding with his mother. In 1900, he lived with his mother and worked as a <a href="day%20labor">day labor</a>er. After serving as constable for five years, on June 3, 1907, he was named Plymouth's High Constable. On his 1918 draft registration card, Brokenshire gave his occupation as "high constable" and a note is appended: "right arm amputated below elbow." Brokenshire never married, and from 1910–1930, he boarded with the Andrew Hendershot family on Shawnee Avenue. In the 1910 census, his occupation was given as a <a href="constable">constable</a>. In May 1912 he rescued a child from being run over by a street car. In 1921, Brokenshire made local news when he was called for jury duty. He claimed that his only vacation each year was to attend the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> and was dismissed.

On May 1, 1937, Brokenshire announced his candidacy for Burgess, but Charles W. Honeywell won the election. However, Brokenshire was appointed Burgess in December 1937 when Honeywell resigned. In July 1939, Brokenshire sent the Borough police to stop <a href="Elizabeth%20Gurley%20Flynn">Elizabeth Gurley Flynn</a>, a union organizer for the <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> and a well-known member of the <a href="American%20Communist%20Party">American Communist Party</a>, from giving a speech in Plymouth. In the general election held on November 4, 1941, Brokenshire, running as a Republican, defeated his Democratic opponent (Edward "Starky" Stugenski) by a vote of 3,490 to 2,406. It was Brokenshire's second term. He was elected for a third term in November 1945. In January 1954, Brokenshire began is fifth term as Burgess at the age of 82, Pennsylvania's oldest chief magistrate. Brokenshire died in April 1956.

Horace Cooper was born about 1883, the son of Joshua Cooper, a house builder who lived on Girard Avenue. In 1930, Horace Cooper lived on Wadhams Street, engaging in the same occupation as his father. Cooper was appointed to be Plymouth's twenty-fifth Burgess after the death of Samuel Brokenshire, but failed to win election on his own account in 1957.

Joseph J. Braja was born in Plymouth on June 9, 1915, the son of Jacob Braja and his wife, Hedwig Gilica. He served during the Second World War in the Third Armored Division under the command of General George Patton and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He attained the rank of Staff Sergeant, and was awarded the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> (1945) and the <a href="Purple%20Heart">Purple Heart</a> medals. In the 1957 race for Burgess, seven men vied in the Republican primary for the office, including incumbent Horace Cooper, who was defeated by Donald E. Hosey. Nevertheless, on November 5, Braja, backed by the Democratic boss Ben Mazur, defeated Hosey by 97 votes to become the first member of the Democratic Party to be elected Burgess. He was sworn in on February 6, 1958 and served until 1962. When not serving as Burgess, he was an employee of the Luzerne County Road and Bridge Department. Braja died on May 23, 2003, and was buried in St. Mary's R.C. Cemetery, Plymouth Township.

Donald E. Hosey was born on May 13, 1922, the son of Plymouth political leader and council member I. J. Hosey and his wife, Mary (Mangan) Hosey. Running as a Republican, Hosey was elected Plymouth's twenty-seventh Burgess in 1962, and served until 1966. He was the borough's first ethnically Irish Burgess. Hosey died on December 28, 1990.

Edward F. Burns was born on August 5, 1922, the son of Edward and Rose Burns, and grew up on Plymouth's Church Street. His father was a coal miner. Burns graduated from St. Vincent's High School (1940) and served during the Second World War in the Army Air Forces. He graduated from King's College, Wilkes-Barre, in 1951, and after briefly teaching school in New Jersey, returned to Plymouth, where he worked as a bank employee for many years. Burns was Plymouth's twenty-eighth Burgess. He was also Plymouth's longest serving Burgess, first elected to the position in January 1966 and holding it through consecutive elections until his death on January 19, 1994. As Burgess, he presided over Plymouth's Centennial celebration in 1966, and oversaw the borough's restoration efforts in the aftermath of the 1972 Agnes Flood. Burns's love of his hometown and his relish for the job were evident to all who knew him, and, in return, he was much beloved by his constituents.

Stanley T. Petrosky was born about 1940, the son of Stanley A. Petrosky and his wife, Margaret Harnen. He attended Plymouth's St. Vincent High School, where he was a member of coach Joe Evan's legendary 1957 basketball team, which won the Pennsylvania state championship. Petrosky graduated from Plymouth High School (1958) and King's College, Wilkes-Barre. He was elected to the Borough Council in 1989, and was appointed Burgess in 1994 after the death of Edward F. Burns. Petrosky died in February 2001 and was buried in St. Mary's Cemetery, Plymouth Twp., Pennsylvania

Dorothy Novak Petrosky is Plymouth's thirtieth and current Burgess (2015). She is a lifetime resident of Plymouth and a graduate of Plymouth High School (Class of 1957). She was married for 36 years to Burgess Stanley T. Petrosky, and was appointed to replace him after his death in February 2001. Petrosky was elected in her own right in the general election that same year and is the first woman to hold the office of Burgess in Plymouth.

C. Louise Boehringer

Cora Louise Boehringer (1878 – September 11, 1956) was the first female superintendent of schools in <a href="Yuma%20County%2C%20Arizona">Yuma County, Arizona</a> and the first woman to be elected to office in the state. She has been called "the mother of the Arizona educational system". In 2008 she was inducted into the <a href="Arizona%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Arizona Women's Hall of Fame</a>.

Early life.
Cora Louise Boehringer was born in <a href="Morrison%2C%20Illinois">Morrison, Illinois</a>, the daughter of Jacob F. Boehringer and Louise Greenawald, immigrants from Germany.

Boehringer attended primary school in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. In 1902 she graduated from <a href="Illinois%20State%20University">DeKalb Normal School</a> in <a href="DeKalb%2C%20Illinois">DeKalb, Illinois</a>. She then attended teacher colleges in Illinois and Missouri. She studied and received degrees from <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> (B.S. in education, 1911), <a href="Teachers%20College%2C%20Columbia%20University">Columbia Teacher's College</a> (professional certification in elementary supervision, 1911) and <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">California State University at Berkeley</a> (M.A. in education, 1930).

Career.
Boehringer held several positions as instructor in Illinois and Missouri: director of the Normal Department, <a href="Illinois%20State%20University">Illinois Normal School</a>, <a href="Geneseo%2C%20Illinois">Geneseo, Illinois</a>; director of the <a href="Southeast%20Missouri%20State%20University">State Normal School</a> in <a href="Cape%20Girardeau%2C%20Missouri">Cape Girardeau, Missouri</a>; faculty member at the <a href="University%20of%20Missouri">University of Missouri</a> (1904); organizer of the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20Mississippi">Mississippi Normal School</a> (1907); and superintendent of the Training School for Teachers, <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a> (1912). In this period she wrote for the Missouri State Courses of Study for Rural and Village Schools.

While in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>, Boehringer participated in the <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> movement.

In 1913, Boehringer was elected County <a href="Superintendent%20%28education%29">Superintendent of Schools</a> in <a href="Yuma%2C%20Arizona">Yuma, Arizona</a>, the first woman to hold such an elective office in Arizona, a position she held until 1917. She became president of the Arizona Council of Administrative Women in Education, an organization of female education workers, such as high school principals, department heads, and county school superintendents.

In 1916, 1922 and 1940, Boehringer ran for <a href="Arizona%20Superintendent%20of%20Public%20Instruction">Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction</a>, but was unsuccessful because the school superintendent was on the state Parole and Pardons Board and the majority of voters was not comfortable with the idea that women could decide on the fate of criminals.

In 1917, Boehringer attended the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign">University of Illinois</a> to take journalism courses and became an educational journalist. She then bought the "Arizona Teacher Magazine" and served as its editor until 1939, when she turned over ownership of the magazine to the Arizona Education Association. She was editor of the "Arizona Patent-Teacher Bulletin", the "National Altrusian", and "Arizona Geography", and a free-lance writer on education and pioneer women. She was vice president of the Arizona National League of American Pen Women, for which she organized the Arizona branches in Phoenix and Tucson. She contributed to "Women in the Southwest" and "Biographies in Arizona Historical Review". She was chairman of educational broadcasts for the <a href="Arizona%20Superintendent%20of%20Public%20Instruction">Arizona Department of Public Instruction</a>.

In 1921 and 1922, Boehringer served in the <a href="Arizona%20House%20of%20Representatives">Arizona House of Representatives</a> as a <a href="Arizona%20Democratic%20Party">Democrat</a>. She also served as chair of the Committee on Education, established the State School Board, created per capita funding for schools, and legitimized children born out of wedlock. In 1933 she was appointed director of curriculum for the Department of Education, a position she held for six years. In 1934 she was appointed president of the Arizona <a href="Parent-Teacher%20Association">Parent-Teacher Association</a>.

In 1926 Boehringer was legislative chairman for the <a href="General%20Federation%20of%20Women%27s%20Clubs">Arizona Federation of Women's Clubs</a>. In 1919, she was a founding member of the <a href="Business%20and%20Professional%20Women%27s%20Foundation">Business and Professional Women's Foundation</a>. She was elected first president of the Arizona branch in 1921 and re-elected in 1924. In both positions, she helped working women to network and advocated for equal pay and education.

Boehringer was involved in many other organizations:

Personal life.
In 1912 C. Louise Boehringer moved to Yuma, Arizona, joining her brother, George, and parents who had moved there in 1909, claiming a 40-acre ranch and establishing a dairy farm.

When in 1940 Boehringer lost for the third time in the run for State Superintendent of Public Instruction, she retired from public life and in 1953 she moved to <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> with her sister-in-law.

She died in Seattle on September 11, 1956, and is buried at <a href="Evergreen%20Washelli%20Memorial%20Park">Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park</a>, Seattle.

<doc id="54779418" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54779418" title="Coal Mining in Plymouth, Pennsylvania">
Coal Mining in Plymouth, Pennsylvania

At the beginning of the 19th century, Plymouth's primary industry was agriculture. However, vast <a href="anthracite">anthracite</a> coal beds lay below the surface at various depths, and by the 1850s, coal mining was the town's primary occupation.

Coal Mining in Plymouth, Pennsylvania.
The Smith Coal Mines

At a few locations in <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plymouth</a>, coal beds were visible in the form of outcrops, and one such location was a gorge along Ransom Creek (now called Coal Creek) about a mile upstream from the Susquehanna River. Coal could be seen (and accessed) on both the east side (Turkey Hill) and the west side (Curry Hill) of the creek.

Attracted by this outcrop, Abijah Smith came to Plymouth about 1806 from <a href="Derby%2C%20Connecticut">Derby, Connecticut</a>, intending to mine, ship and sell coal. In the fall of 1807, Smith floated an ark down the Susquehanna River loaded with about fifty tons of anthracite coal, and shipped it to <a href="Columbia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Columbia</a> in <a href="Lancaster%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster County</a>. The significance of Smith's shipment went unnoticed until 1873, when Hendrick B. Wright, in his "Historical Sketches of Plymouth", wrote,
"Anthracite coal had been used before 1807, in this valley and elsewhere, in small quantities in furnaces, with an air blast; but the traffic in coal as an article of general use, was commenced by Abijah Smith, of Plymouth."
Beginning with the fifty tons of coal shipped by Abijah Smith in 1807, Plymouth's and the Wyoming Valley's coal industry grew steadily. In 1830, the "Baltimore Patriot" reported that "... a greater quantity of Anthracite Coal has been sent down the Susquehanna this Spring than in any former season. The Baltimore Company have sent three thousand tons, and from other mines about seven thousand tons were dispatched, making an aggregate of ten thousand tons."

The North Branch Canal

As late as the 1840s, whenever high water allowed, coal from Wyoming Valley's coal mines was shipped down the Susquehanna River on wooden arks. But by the end of 1830, canal boats began to replace arks as the preferred method of transporting coal and other goods to market. In 1826, the Pennsylvania Board of Canal Commissioners engaged John Bennett to survey the route of a new canal, to be called the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Canal">North Branch Canal</a>, to run alongside the north branch (the main branch) of the Susquehanna River from <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland</a> to the <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> border. In early 1827, Bennet reported that the canal was feasible, and in 1828, the state legislature authorized funds for construction. Charles T. Whippo, who had worked on the construction of the <a href="Erie%20Canal">Erie Canal</a>, was engaged to survey the route and supervise construction. The southern portion of the canal, as built, ran for along the west side of the river, from Northumberland to <a href="West%20Nanticoke%2C%20Pennsylvania">West Nanticoke</a>, where a dam at <a href="Nanticoke%20Falls">Nanticoke Falls</a> was built to divert water from the river into the canal. The work was generally complete by the fall of 1830. The first load of coal shipped from the Wyoming Valley reached <a href="Berwick%2C%20Pennsylvania">Berwick</a> in October.

The canal was a boon to Plymouth's coal operators, who in 1830 included John Smith, Freeman Thomas, Henderson Gaylord and Thomas Borbidge, and encouraged others to open mines, such as Jameson Harvey and Jacob Gould. Smith's teamsters led teams of horses deep into his mine, turned the team, loaded the wagon and then drove the team to the river bank to load the coal into <a href="Narrowboat">canal boats</a>. Gaylord, whose mine was at the base of Welsh Hill, improved on this method and built a <a href="gravity%20railroad">gravity railroad</a> that ran along what is now Walnut Street, down what is now Gaylord Avenue, to his wharf on the river. A similar road, called the Swetland Railroad, was built from mines in Poke Hollow down a route which later became Washington Avenue, across Bull Run to another wharf on the river. Freeman Thomas built a railroad from his Grand Tunnel mine to a chutehouse along the river near the entrance to the canal.

The early coal mines in Plymouth supported an ancillary industry, boat building. The arks used to transport goods on the river were built in a basin where Wadham's Creek entered the river. After the canal was built, the arks began to be replaced by flat-bottomed canal boats, built in the same basin with a distinctive design, known as "Shawnee boats." Many of the town's young men became boatmen and were well known along the length of the canal for their distinctive call, "Shawnee against the World."

The Lackawanna & Bloomsburg Railroad

The 1858 Anthracite Map, prepared as part of the First Pennsylvania Geological Survey, illustrates Plymouth's mines and collieries at a moment of transition. The Lackawanna & Bloomsburg Railroad was largely completed and had begun to replace the North Branch Canal as the preferred method for shipping coal. In 1858, most mines in Plymouth were tunnels driven into the hillside above water level, with one exception: a shaft had been sunk in 1856 at the Patten Mine by experienced miners from England and Scotland. It was the first deep mine shaft in Plymouth and the first on the west side of the river—a harbinger of things to come. In 1858, all of Plymouth's mines were run by small local operators. This would soon change as large corporations, some affiliated with railroads, began to take control of much of the town's coal lands. The larger firms would be better able to handle labor disputes, and had the necessary capital to conduct deep shaft mining and operate the mines on a larger, more efficient scale.

The 1858 map (below), illustrates the path of the railroad. Several collieries appear at the west end of Plymouth, including the Harvey Mine, Grand Tunnel, Reynolds (Chauncey), French Tunnel (Jersey Mine), Reynolds (Washington Mine) and the Smith mine operation at the upper end of Coal Creek. The Wadhams mine appears along <a href="Wadham%20Creek">Wadhams Creek</a> above Plymouth Village. A railroad branch line (Gaylord's Railroad) is shown running along Pine Swamp Creek (later <a href="Brown%20Creek">Brown's Creek</a>). One branch of this railroad crossed what later became Bull Run and led to a wharf along the Susquehanna River. Another branch railroad ran down to Henderson Gaylord's wharf, near what is now Gaylord Avenue. The Patten mine and Cooper mine (labeled as Galard) are shown along the creek. East of Plymouth village, John Shonk's colliery, called Rudmandale, appears where the Lance Colliery would later be, and above that, Shupp's Creek and Ross Hill are illustrated just before the Boston Mine was established.

The Susquehanna Coal Company Mines.
The Harvey Mine
Jameson Harvey was born in 1796, the son of Elisha Harvey and his wife, Rosanna Jameson. Harvey's farm, about , was located in Plymouth Township on the east side of the intersection of Harvey's Creek and the Susquehanna River. In 1832, he built a <a href="Federal-style">Federal-style</a> farmhouse and barn, both of which still stand today greatly altered, on what is now McDonald Street. By 1830, probably inspired by his neighbor Freeman Thomas's Grand Tunnel coal mine, Harvey supplemented his farm income by constructing a coal tunnel. Perhaps learning from Thomas's experience, Harvey's tunnel was higher up the hill, and thus a shorter distance from the coal beds. Later, Harvey constructed one of Plymouth's first <a href="coal%20breaker">coal breaker</a>s. His mine was closer than any other to the Nanticoke Dam and the entrance to the North Branch Canal, and when the railroad arrived, it ran right across Harvey's property. These geographical advantages helped make the mine a very successful venture. In 1869, Harvey moved to Wilkes-Barre, and in 1871, he sold his coal lands to the Susquehanna Coal Co., which merged Harvey's mine with the Grand Tunnel into a new operation called the Susquehanna Coal Co. Colliery No. 3.

The Grand Tunnel

Freeman Thomas was an early land owner in Plymouth. In 1809, he acquired several patents for lots in the lower end of the township, calling his estate "Harmony", better known in later years as the "Grand Tunnel". About 1828, Thomas began to dig a tunnel through solid rock into the hillside, hoping to reach the famed Red Ash coal vein. He must have succeeded by 1834, for on the 6th of August that year, he petitioned the courts for the right to build a <a href="gravity%20railroad">gravity railroad</a> from his tunnel to a chute house along the Susquehanna River just above the Nanticoke Dam. The private railroad allowed Thomas to ship his coal to the iron forges in Danbury and to other points south via the newly built North Branch Canal. Thomas died in 1847, and in 1852, William L. Lance, Sr. became a tenant of Thomas's children. Lance operated the mine until 1856, when he assigned his lease to the Mammouth Vein Coal Co. In January 1860, Mammouth abandoned Thomas's chutehouse and built a new one adjacent to the recently built Lackawanna & Bloomsburg railroad. In 1866, the Grand Tunnel Coal Co. operated the mine, and in 1871, the New England Coal Co. operated the mine.

Susquehanna Coal Co. No. 3 Colliery

In 1871, the Susquehanna Coal Company, owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, took control of both the Harvey Mine and the Grand Tunnel, although James Hutchison stayed on as mine boss. After a boiler explosion in 1871, the SCC took down the old Harvey breaker and on July 27, 1872 began operating a new one, considered to be one of the largest in the district. It was designed by Charles F. Ingram, a mining engineer from Wilkes-Barre, and built by James Linskill, a carpenter from Plymouth.

The Chauncey Colliery.
The Chauncey Colliery was located between the Grand Tunnel and the Avondale collieries. It was one of the few Plymouth collieries to remain independent of the large mining corporations. According to one source, the mine was named after Chauncey A. Reynolds of Plymouth who was said to have driven the first tunnel, probably in the late 1850s, although another, earlier source attributes the name to Thomas Chauncey James, a veteran of the War of 1812 and for a time the postmaster of the Grand Tunnel post office. The Chauncey was also known as the Union Mine, and from about 1861 to 1866 the Union Coal Co., in association with Charles Hutchison, operated the mine, working both a shaft and a slope. At the time, capacity was about 50,000 tons per year.

From at least 1869 until at least 1875, the mine was operated by Roberts, Albrighton & Co., and John Albrighton, the mine boss, employed about 100 men. In 1875, a major cave caused a stoppage of work at both the Chauncey and the adjacent Grand Tunnel mine. In 1880, the mine was operated by B. B. Reynolds. In 1881, Thomas P. MacFarlane was the operator and 24,515 tons were shipped. In 1891, MacFarlane still operated the mine. By 1896, Reynolds & Moyer Coal Co. operated the Chauncey.

The last operator of the Chauncey, George F. Lee, was the son of Conrad Lee, from 1865 to 1886 the outside foreman of the nearby Avondale Colliery where George F. Lee was born in 1870. He purchased the Chauncey in 1902, and operated it as the George F. Lee Coal Co and also ran a coal distribution center in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, New York. In 1914, the Chauncey processed about 6,600 tons per month. In 1919, Lee built a new breaker with a capacity of 1,000 tons daily, which began operating on August 25. The breaker, designed by Frank Davenport, an engineer from Wilkes-Barre, was destroyed by fire on January 28, 1923, the loss estimated to be $250,000. The following day, Lee engaged E. E. Reilly of Kingston to build a new breaker. At the end of 1936, the George F. Lee Coal Co. still worked both the Chauncey mine and breaker, producing 38,712 tons of coal, but by 1940, the company was bankrupt and in receivership. In 1940, the Glen Alden Coal Company took ownership of the colliery, and in February 1941 began to dismantle the breaker.

The Avondale Colliery.
In November 1808, Hezekiah Roberts, Jr. obtained patents on five lots in the western end of Plymouth Township, about total. He called his estate "Avondale", and it eventually gave its name to the colliery. After receiving these patents Roberts sold his soon-to-be valuable coal lands, and by 1810 was farming in <a href="Genoa%20Township%2C%20Delaware%20County%2C%20Ohio">Genoa Township, Delaware County, Ohio</a>. In addition to Roberts' , the <a href="Delaware%2C%20Lackawanna%20and%20Western%20Railroad">Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad</a> compiled a large number of lots, including part of Freeman Thomas's Grand Tunnel property. If one includes the Wright family's that comprised the Jersey mine, the DL&W's Avondale holdings included over .

The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western took a circuitous path to ownership of Avondale because its 1854 charter limited its ownership of coal lands. As a result, it used surrogates to acquire coal properties. In 1863, John C. Phelps, a director of the DL&W, leased a portion of the Avondale property from William Reynolds and Henderson Gaylord, Plymouth natives. In 1866, the mine was transferred to the Steuben Coal Co., which in turn became part of the Nanticoke Coal & Iron Co., whose board of directors overlapped with the board of the DL&W. The NC&I built the first breaker at Avondale.

On September 6, 1869, the <a href="Avondale%20Mine%20Disaster">Avondale Mine Disaster</a> occurred, during which a fire in the shaft, ignited by a ventilating furnace, spread to the breaker which stood over the mine shaft. The breaker was destroyed by fire, trapping 108 men and boys in the mine below. All were killed, as were two men who volunteered to enter the mine after the fire. Soon after the disaster, a second breaker was built at the colliery.

In 1914, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western operated both the mine and the breaker. On February 9, 1935, Glen Alden Coal Co. (successor to the DL&W) began to dismantle and demolish the Avondale breaker and to close the mine. In 1936, no coal was produced. However, in December 1940, Glen Alden resumed mining on a limited scale taking coal to the Lance Breaker to be processed.

The Jersey Colliery.
The Jersey was one of Plymouth's oldest mines, a tunnel located at the top of Jersey Road in the hollow between Avondale Hill and Curry Hill, just west of the Plymouth Borough boundary. The mine was located on two lots of about , patented to Ellen Wadhams in 1808 by virtue of the claim of her late husband Moses Wadhams. The mine was established by Joseph Wright, Ellen's second husband, a Quaker who migrated to Plymouth from New Jersey. Wright's stepdaughter, Lydia Wadhams, married Samuel French who became the second operator of the Jersey. French, who was the stepson of Plymouth mine operator John Smith, operated the mine until about 1855, when the Scottish immigrant Robert Love, then a young man in his twenties, took control. Love built a gravity railroad from the mine down to the newly arrived Lackawanna & Bloomsburg Railroad and supplied the L&B with the first coal shipped from Plymouth by rail.

By 1865, the Jersey was operated by the <a href="Delaware%2C%20Lackawanna%20and%20Western%20Railroad">Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad</a> and had an estimated annual capacity of 50,000 tons. In 1871, and in accordance with laws enacted following the 1869 disaster at the adjacent Avondale mine, the DL&W sank an X air shaft at the Jersey to help ventilate the mine. A breaker sat on the hill just below the mine as early as 1885. The DL&W operated the Jersey until 1902, when an underground mine fire broke out. As of 1942, the DL&W's successor, the Glen Alden Coal Co., was still trying to extinguish the fire.

The Nottingham Colliery.
As perfected by 1908, the Nottingham Colliery included the mines established by Abijah and John Smith, and the Washington mine. All four operations have separate histories:

Abijah Smith's Mine

Abijah Smith was born in <a href="Derby%2C%20Connecticut">Derby, Connecticut</a>, about 1763, where he married and fathered numerous children. He worked as a <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a> or harness maker. In 1804, he advertised: "For sale by Abijah Smith, at Derby Landing, Skirting and Bridle leather, of the first quality, May 7, 1804.

It is not known exactly why Smith left Derby for the Wyoming Valley, but one journalist reporting in 1901 related an anecdote that had been passed down through the years. "The story is that Abijah Smith heard through some man, who had been traveling in Pennsylvania, and who passing through Derby on his way home stopped at Smith's blacksmith shop to have his horse shod, about black stone in Pennsylvania that would burn. The result of this conversation was that Smith made a trip to Pennsylvania and eventually located there ... He left Derby in 1806 and in 1807 mined 56 tons of coal in Plymouth, Pa. at the old mine now rented to the Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., and known as the Smith red ash coal."

According to Hendrick B. Wright, in the fall of 1807, Abijah Smith purchased an ark from <a href="John%20Penn%20Arndt">John P. Arndt</a>, a Wilkes-Barre merchant, which Arndt had used for the transportation of plaster. Smith floated the ark from Wilkes-Barre to Plymouth, loaded it with about fifty tons of anthracite coal, and shipped it to <a href="Columbia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Columbia</a>, in <a href="Lancaster%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster County</a>. According to Wright:
"...this was probably the first cargo of anthracite coal that was ever ordered for sale in this or any country. The trade of 1807 was fifty tons ... Abijah Smith therefore, of Plymouth, was the pioneer in the coal business. Anthracite coal had been used before 1807, in this valley and elsewhere, in small quantities in furnaces, with an air blast; but the traffic in coal as an article of general use, was commenced by Abijah Smith, of Plymouth."
John Smith's Mine
In 1805, Hezekiah Roberts, Sr. obtained a patent for of land, called Lot 49, on the west side of Coal Creek, which he sold to William Currie (who gave the place the name Curry Hill). In 1810, Currie sold the mineral rights to Lewis Hepburn (Abijah's Smith's partner), and in 1811, Hepburn sold half of these rights to John Smith, Abijah's brother. In 1816, after Lewis Hepburn died, Hepburn's son Patrick sold Smith the second half of the coal rights.

John Smith operated his mine on the west side of Coal Creek from 1811 until about 1837. A visitor in 1830 described Smith's coal mine as having a thick bed of coal, and found the mine "...extensively wrought, and the scene both without and within is exceedingly imposing. The bed is followed into the mountain, large pillars of coal being left to support the superincumbent weight..." The visitor noted that in some areas Smith had removed all of the coal, leaving only a roof of <a href="slate">slate</a> which then caved in. As a result, Smith modified his technique to leave two feet of coal to form the ceiling.

In 1840, John Smith leased his coal beds to his son, Francis J. Smith, his stepson, Samuel French, and his sons-in-law, Draper Smith and William C. Reynolds. In 1848, Smith sold the coal rights to Lot 49 outright to Reynolds.

Washington Colliery
The Washington Colliery was first opened by John Shay about 1854. Shay built a drift, an <a href="inclined%20plane">inclined plane</a>, and a breaker. Shutz, Shay & Heebner operated the colliery until August 1869, when they sold their rights to Broderick, Conyngham & Co. At the same time, BC&C entered into leases to operate the Nottingham Colliery, the old John Smith mine and the old Abijah Smith mine, and from then on all four mines were operated under common management. On April 1, 1872 BC&C sold their lease to the Lehigh Navigation & Coal Co., and on January 1, 1874, the LN&C sold to the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. which operated the mine as the Reynolds No. 16. By April 1890, the first breaker had been dismantled and a new breaker was in operation. In 1908, the L&W-B abandoned the second breaker and began to process coal from the Washington mine at the Nottingham breaker. In March 1912, the company destroyed the Washington breaker with dynamite.

Nottingham Colliery
The Nottingham Coal Co. of <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> was incorporated on March 21, 1865, and obtained a lease to mine coal from Plymouth's Reynolds family, a lease which would bring the family great wealth. Bryce R. Blair was named superintendent, and proceeded to construct a coal breaker and a shaft, said to pass through of quicksand on its way to the coal beds below.

In August 1869, the Nottingham assigned their lease to the firm of Broderick, Conyngham & Co. In order to create a second means of egress from the mine, as required by the mine safety law enacted after the 1869 <a href="Avondale%20Mine%20Disaster">Avondale Mine Disaster</a>, BC&Co.. drove to the west to connect with its Washington mine. On April 1, 1872 BC&Co. sold their lease to the <a href="Lehigh%20Coal%20%26amp%3B%20Navigation%20Company">Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company</a>, and on January 1, 1874, the LC&N sold the property to the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. which operated the mine as the Nottingham No. 15 Colliery.

In 1936, the Glen Alden Coal Co. operated the Nottingham and produced 263,836 tons of coal. However, in August 1936, Glen Alden demolished the Nottingham breaker, part of a general consolidation of mine operations in the Wyoming Valley. Thenceforth, coal from the Nottingham was processed at the Lance breaker. Interestingly, the lone voice of protest of the Nottingham's demise was the Luzerne County Communist Party, whose presidential candidate, Earl Browder, called upon the community to raise its voice against "this wrecking plan of the coal companies." In December 1936, Glen Alden operated the Nottingham for the first time since the breaker's demolition, and after a subsequent period of idleness, resumed operations at the Nottingham again in 1938. The mine continued to operate into the 1950s. In June 1954, Charles Medura was killed in the mine by a fall of rock, the last of many fatalities at the mine.

The Parrish Colliery.
The Parrish Colliery was a relative late-comer to Plymouth. Its origins can be traced to the sale by the Wadhams family of their homestead farm in 1871 to the Wilkes-Barre Coal & Iron Co. The property was located in the center of Plymouth Borough, between Academy and Girard streets. In 1874, the Wilkes-Barre Coal & Iron Co. became part of the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., which acquired the property, but by some arrangement the mine was operated by the Parrish Coal Co., organized in 1884. The company built a breaker, said to be "a model of neatness," built by contractor Joseph C. Tyrrell and completed in September 1884. On the night of January 25, 1887, the new breaker caught fire and was completely destroyed. Another was built and was operating by July.

By 1914, the mine had reverted to the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. which operated a <a href="coal%20preparation%20plant">washery</a> and breaker. Ash and waste water from the washery were flushed into the Susquehanna River. In June 1914, the company closed the Parrish breaker and began construction of a tunnel under the river to transport coal to the company's breaker in Buttonwood. In 1920, the Glen Alden Coal Co. acquired the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., including the Parrish Colliery, and in July of that year the breaker blew down in a wind and rain storm.

The Dodson Colliery.
The Dodson Colliery was located at Bull Run in Plymouth Borough, and its breaker stood alongside the tracks of the Lackawanna & Bloomsburg Railroad. The Dodson's coal lands ran from Center Avenue on the west to Pierce Street on the east, and thus the Dodson's mining operations took place beneath the central business district of the Borough. The colliery was first developed by Fellows & Dodson, Co., beginning in 1869, and by 1870 a large breaker had been built and a shaft sunk to a depth of .

By 1872, the mine was operated by the Wilkes-Barre Coal & Iron Co. which had recently gained control of nearly all of Plymouth Borough's coal lands east of Academy Street, including the Lance and the Gaylord collieries. In 1872, the company employed 80 men at the Dodson, sank the shaft to a depth of , and began to experience problems with water infiltration. In 1874, the Wilkes-Barre Coal & Iron Co. merged into the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., but by early 1877 this firm was overextended and (temporarily) in receivership.

In 1877, the Plymouth Coal Company, managed by John J. Shonk and John C. Haddock, gained control of the Dodson. In October 1877, the "Wilkes-Barre Times" reported that "work is to be resumed at the Dodson shaft by the Plymouth Coal Co." In 1882, Haddock assumed sole control of the Plymouth Coal Co., and ran the Dodson until his death in New York in December 1914. Haddock had a litigious reputation due to his disputes with neighboring mines, with Plymouth Borough and with Plymouth's Sweitzer family. He disputed freight rates, testifying before the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Commission">Interstate Commerce Commission</a> that the railroads discriminated against small operators.

On July 13, 1899, the first Dodson breaker burned down, and on March 5, 1900, work began on the second breaker. In 1914, Plymouth Borough obtained an injunction preventing the Plymouth Coal Co. from mining, owing to surface subsidence, and for most of that year the mine was idle. In January 1915, the Kingston Coal Co., which operated the adjacent Gaylord Colliery, announced it would buy the Dodson mine.

The Lance Colliery.
In his will of 1834, Jacob Gould bequeathed to his seven children "all the coal mines which are now or may hereafter be found on any part of my landed property ... and that there shall be a reserve made in the division of my real or landed property sufficient for all necessary roads to go to and from said coal mines and sufficient land for to deposite all coal and coal dirt and the like that is necessary, and that each one shall have an equal right to dig or mine coal at anytime, and each one shall be at their proper expense of keeping said coal mine or mines in repair according to what coal they may dig or mine." He further willed that with respect to "the division of all my coal mines ... each daughter is made equal to each son and holding equal rights & interest..." Twenty-four years later, the 1858 Pennsylvania Geological Survey reported that "coal has been wrought languidly for thirty years" at "Gould and Shunk's mine", the operator being John Jenks Shonk, and the mine called Rudmandale, located just west of Shupp's Creek. The small operation eventually became the Lance Colliery, one of Wyoming Valley's largest and most enduring.

Despite its name, the Lance Colliery was controlled by William L. Lance, Sr. for a very short time. About 1865, Lance and his sons bought the Gould Homestead, which ran from the Susquehanna River to State Street, just east of the Plymouth Borough line. The land contained about of coal measures. In order to develop the property by sinking a deep shaft to reach the coal seams, and building a breaker to process the coal, Lance borrowed money from Payne Pettebone, a coal mine operator. Lance overextended himself, and Pettebone aggressively pursued repayment. In January 1871, Lance's friend, Samuel Bonnell, Jr., bought the property at Sheriff's Sale so as to satisfy the debt. Bonnell allowed Lance and his sons to continue to operate the mine. As of 1871, Lance had sunk the shaft , and was in process of sinking a second shaft for emergency egress. However, in July 1871, Bonnell sold the improvements and leased the coal rights to the Wilkes-Barre Coal & Iron Co., and in February 1876, Bonnell sold the property outright to the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. Lance, who moved to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and became a mat manufacturer, spent years in court, suing his old friend Bonnell in a futile attempt to recover the mine.

According to "The Engineering and Mining Journal", in 1879 the Lance Colliery was operated by Charles Parrish & Co., a subsidiary or tenant of the L&W-B. The journal reported that "the mine having been idle for about a year, has again been started up." In 1883, William Lance's old breaker was torn down and on June 30, 1883 the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co. began building a new breaker.

In 1931, the Glen Alden Coal Co., successor to the L&W-B, erected a third breaker. By this time, large coal companies were more concerned about their public image, and Glen Alden made an effort to make the building and grounds attractive. Writing in 1941, a newspaper reporter described the colliery as "beautifully landscaped." In 1936, Glen Alden produced 653,141 tons of coal, and in 1945 produced 489,889 tons of coal.

The Gaylord Colliery.
The Gaylord was opened about 1854 by Henderson Gaylord, who built a private railroad from the colliery across what was then the Nesbit family farm to a wharf on the river near the corner of Gaylord Avenue and Main Street. Gaylord leased the mine to Van Homer & Fellows, then to Eric L. Hedstrum (of <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>). In 1866, J. Langdon & Co. (later H.S. Mercur & Co.) operated the mine. Beginning in 1871, the Wilkes-Barre Coal & Iron Co. and then its successor, the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., operated the mine, but this firm fell into receivership in 1877 and lost their lease. The Gaylord Coal Co., operated by Thomas Beaver and Daniel Edwards, took control of the Gaylord, and later merged with the Kingston Coal Co. 

On March 5, 1879, the breaker at the Gaylord was destroyed by fire. and on June 11, 1879, the "Wilkes-Barre Record" announced that Alanson Tyrrell of Kingston had been awarded a contract to build a new breaker. In August 1879, "The Engineering and Mining Journal" wrote, "the Gaylord Coal Co. is building a new breaker in place of the one burned down last summer, and which is to prepare the coal from the old slope workings, with its tunnel to the seven foot seam, as well as the coal from its new shaft which was sunk by the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Co., when it had it, to the Bennett seam. The new firm contemplates sinking down through the Bennett to the Red Ash seam. The coals from the Seven Foot and the Red Ash will cause it to be a very fine colliery." The prediction proved accurate: in 1887, the Gaylord shaft and slope mined 248,276 tons of coal.

On February 13, 1894, the "Scranton Republican" reported a large cave-in at the Gaylord mine: "We are called upon to detail the awful scenes of another miner horror. Thirteen men who went down to repair some damaged work-lugs in the Gaylord slope at Plymouth are caught by a fall of coal and most probably called to the great beyond, their bodies crushed and very little hope entertained for their recovery for days to come." On February 14, The "Wilkes-Barre Record" reported one hundred men were digging for the entombed miners. Despite these efforts, the situation was hopeless. On February 19 the "Wilkes-Barre Record" reported that ground water in the Gaylord was hindering the rescue. Finally on March 12 the body of Peter McLaughlin was recovered, the first of the miners to be found. By April 6, the last of the bodies was taken out of the mine, that of the foreman, Thomas Picton.

According to the Water Supply Commission of Pennsylvania, in 1914 the colliery was still operated by the Kingston Coal Co., producing about 225 tons of coal per day. Slush and waste water were pumped into three boreholes, rather than into Brown's Creek, and washwater was pumped from the Susquehanna River, 23,000,000 gallons in four months.

In May 1935, the Glen Alden Coal Co. bought the Gaylord mine from the Kingston Coal Co. for $100,000. Glen Alden paid about $40,000 in back taxes owed to Plymouth Township, Plymouth Borough and Larksville Borough. On June 15, 1935, the second Gaylord breaker was demolished with dynamite. By this time, the mine was largely depleted, but in December 1940, the "Sunday Independent" reported that "the old Gaylord mine, now being operated by Samuel Bird, brother of Morgan Bird, is showing signs of being able to absorb additional number of men in the future...[the] Lance [breaker] prepares the coal." In 1945, the Gaylord worked 284 days and produced 26,301 tons of coal, and In January 1955, the Bird Mining Co. stopped mining at the Gaylord.

Hillside Colliery.
Hillside was a minor operation first worked by George W. Shonk and John Barry, operating as the Barry, Shonk & Dooley Coal Co., perhaps on land owned by the Barry family, old settlers on Plymouth Mountain east of Poke Hollow. Coal was extracted by means of a slope dug into the side of the mountain. According to the newspapers, in November 1906, the colliery began "mining on a large scale" and a "breaker ... erected which has a capacity of several hundred tons daily." In 1907, Shonk and Barry sold their interest in the mine to Bright Coal Co., owned by a group of investors from <a href="Scranton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Scranton</a>. The newspapers reported that mining operations would be "carried out on a much larger scale" than before. In 1914, Bright Coal Co. still operated the Hillside. At the time, waste water from the mine was dumped into a tributary of Brown's Creek. In 1917, Bright mined 10,252 tons.

Delaware & Hudson Collieries Along Brown's Creek.
Fuller's Shaft (Delaware & Hudson No. 5)
The former railroad crossing at Plymouth's Bull Run (long disappeared) was originally called Fuller's Crossing, after the mine operator J. C. Fuller. The railroad ran from his mine (and several others), crossed Main Street and continued down to a wharf on the Susquehanna River. Fuller's mine was located just above the Gaylord colliery along what is now Washington Avenue. According to Munsell, the shaft was sunk by the (old) Plymouth Coal Co. and J. C. Fuller in 1858. In 1864, Fuller operated the mine, which produced 23,827 tons of coal, making it that year the fourth largest mine in the Plymouth district. In 1871, operation of the mine was transferred from Fuller to the Northern Coal & Iron Co., a firm owned by the Delaware & Hudson Canal Co. and by 1873, if not earlier, a breaker was operating at the mine.

On April 27, 1907, the No. 5 breaker burned to the ground, causing an "awe inspiring spectacle." At the time, the breaker had been abandoned by the D&H and was being used as a washery by the Rissinger Bros. By 1909, a second breaker was built, intended to process coal from several D & H mines. In 1914, The D&H was operating both the breaker and a washery and waste water from these was dumped into Shupp's Creek, not Brown's Creek, suggesting that the breaker may have been relocated from its original site to a new one farther south. In 1919, fire destroyed the second No. 5 breaker. That year, a new reinforced concrete breaker, called the Loree No. 5 Breaker, was built to process coal from all of the D&H operations in Plymouth.

Swetland Shaft (Delaware & Hudson No. 4)

The Swetland Shaft was located on the northwest corner of the intersection of Vine and State streets in the Poke Hollow section of what is now <a href="Larksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Larksville</a> Borough. According to court records, William Patten and Thomas Fender established this mine in 1851. About 1855, Patten and Fender contracted with an English immigrant, John Dennis (a future Plymouth burgess), to sink a shaft to the coal seams below. It was said to be the first mine shaft on the west side of the Susquehanna River. In January 1857, William Patten died when he fell down the newly constructed shaft. Fender continued to operate the mine, but on February 25, 1860, lost the property at sheriff's sale. Josiah W. Eno built a breaker at the mine in 1857, which he operated until 1861.

A.C. Laning & Co. bought the mine, and subsequently John Jenks Shonk, Payne Pettebone and William Swetland bought the mine. In 1865, J. Langdon & Co. operated the mine. According to Samuel L. French, David Levi, a Welshman, operated the mine, followed by A.J. Davis and Charles Bennett. By 1870, J.C. Fuller operated the mine, and in 1871, the Northern Coal & Iron Co., a subsidiary of the Delaware & Hudson Canal Co., assumed operation of the mine. Michael Shonk was mine boss for both Fuller and the NC&I. By 1873, a coal breaker stood on the site, and in 1901, the D&H dismantled the breaker. As of 1914, coal from the No. 4 shaft was hauled to the No. 5 breaker for processing, although a washery at the No. 4 prepared enough coal to run the colliery boilers. As of 1925, the D&H continued to operate the mine, calling it the Loree No. 4.

Delaware & Hudson Collieries Along Shupp's Creek.
Boston Colliery

The Boston was unique in that the mine and the breaker were originally built about 1-1/4 miles apart from one another. The mine and shaft were located north of State Street where it intersects with Shupp's Creek. A railroad was built from the mine along the creek down to the first Boston breaker, located next to and east of the old Shupp Cemetery at the bottom of Boston Hill. The mine was opened in 1857 by the Boston Coal Co., which leased to the <a href="Delaware%2C%20Lackawanna%20and%20Western%20Railroad">Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad</a> in 1858, and sold to the <a href="Delaware%20and%20Hudson%20Railway">Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.</a> in 1868, subject to the lease of 1858. In 1883, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western mined 4,351 tons, but in January that year the Delaware & Hudson assumed operation of the mine.

On January 16, 1887, the Boston breaker was destroyed by fire. The Delaware & Hudson built a second breaker, this time adjacent to the mine. It was completed by November 1887. In 1909, the second Boston breaker was demolished and coal from the mine processed at the Delaware & Hudson No. 5 colliery.

Delaware & Hudson No. 1 Colliery

The No. 1 colliery was the most westerly of three collieries constructed in the late 1860s along Shupp's Creek by the Northern Coal and Iron Co., located along Main Street on the west side of the creek. The <a href="Delaware%20and%20Hudson%20Railway">Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.</a>, which owned the NC&I, built a railroad branch connecting the No. 1, 2 and 3 collieries to the Lackawanna & Bloomsburg Railroad. By 1872, the shaft was deep and 130 men were working in the Lance and Cooper veins. As of 1914, the Delaware & Hudson continued to operate the mine, dumping waste water into the creek.

Delaware & Hudson No. 2 Colliery

The Northern Coal & Iron Co. built the No. 2 shaft on the north side of Shupp's Creek, west of Nesbitt Street or about east of the No. 1 shaft. By 1872, the shaft was deep reaching the Lawler and Wilkman coal veins. By 1873, the NC&I operated a breaker at the shaft. As of 1914, the Delaware & Hudson Canal Co. was operating a breaker and washery there, dumping waste water into Shupp's Creek.

Delaware & Hudson No. 3 Colliery

The No. 3 Colliery was located along Shupp's creek about a mile east of the No. 2 Colliery. By 1872, a contractor, T.C. Harkness, had sunk the shaft and was driving a tunnel toward the Boston Mine to create a second means of egress. By 1873, the Northern Coal & Iron Co. operated a breaker on the site.

By the year 1893, the <a href="Delaware%20and%20Hudson%20Railway">Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.</a> was operating the colliery, producing 219,044 tons of coal. However, on November 15, 1894, the first No.3 breaker burned. The headline in the "Wilkes-Barre Times" read, "A glorious scene – the whole valley lighted up and glare seen in Scranton – will be re-built at once." In January 1895, the new breaker at the No. 3 was under construction, designed by Abram Shaffer; it began operating on June 1, 1895. According to the newspapers, it was clad in corrugated iron and had a "fine appearance." By 1916, the Delaware & Hudson decided to abandon the No. 3 breaker and run coal from the mine through the company's No. 5 breaker, and on the morning of December 2, the No. 3 breaker was destroyed by fire.

Kingston Coal Company Mines.
In 1864, Waterman & Beaver Co., owned by industrialists from <a href="Danville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Danville, Pennsylvania</a>, sank the No. 1 shaft in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Pennsylvania">Kingston</a>, known as "Morgan's Shaft" after superintendent David Morgan. In 1868, Daniel Edwards, superintendent of W&B's Danville iron mines, replaced Morgan as superintendent. The firm's coal lands spanned the boundary between Plymouth and Kingston townships, and in 1872, the No. 2 shaft and the No. 2 breaker were constructed, both in Plymouth. A railroad branch connected the No. 2 colliery to the Lackawanna & Bloomsburg Railroad. In 1877, the firm's name was changed to Kingston Coal Company. The Plymouth side of the colliery became part of <a href="Edwardsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Edwardsville</a> when it was incorporated as a separate borough on June 16, 1884.

Woodward Colliery.
The Woodward Colliery was located on the eastern slope of Ross Hill up-hill from Toby's Creek. With of coal lands, it was a major colliery, and the <a href="Delaware%2C%20Lackawanna%20%26amp%3B%20Western%20Railroad">Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad</a> took several years to establish it. In 1881, in what was then Plymouth Township, the DL&W began to sink two shafts, the largest of which (at 22 X 55 feet) was sunk to the Red Ash coal vein. By 1883, the DL&W had begun to construct a breaker and to prepare railroad beds for a branch line connecting the breaker to the DL&W's railroad line on the west shore of the Susquehanna River. In September 1883, four men working on the shaft were killed when the platform supporting them collapsed. In 1884, the colliery became part of the newly formed <a href="Edwardsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Edwardsville Borough</a>. By 1888, the colliery was complete, and in July the Woodward began to ship coal. The new mine and breaker had a large capacity: in May 1904, the colliery broke a record, producing 77,383 tons of coal.

In July 1916, the DL&W announced plans to build a new concrete breaker, and to fill in part of Toby's Creek so as to straighten the railroad bed leading to the breaker. By 1917, the new breaker was under construction. The foundation was built by Curtis Construction Co. of New York, and the steel frame built by the DL&W. The facade of the breaker was clad with special high-strength wire glass. The new colliery had its own power plant fueled by coal from the mine. In 1936, the Glen Alden Coal Co., successor to the DL&W, operated the Woodward and produced 858,711 tons of coal. In 1945, they produced 745,586 tons.

She currently is a PhD candidate in Choreography at the <a href="Stockholm%20University%20of%20the%20Arts">Stockholm University of the Arts</a>.

Work as a choreographer.
Eleanor Bauer's work is at the intersection of choreography, dance, text, music and performance. Her productions vary in size and used media, and focus on questioning categories, production methods and ways of thinking performance. In her work, she utilizes the strict codes and concepts of contemporary dance in a shrewd and subtle way, with an expressive directness that tends toward cabaret and vaudeville.

Eleanor Bauer created her first solo production, "ELEANOR!" (Eleanor Bauer/GoodMove, 2005) while still studying at P.A.R.T.S.. Afterwards, a wide range of productions followed, including a trilogy consisting of "A Dance for the Newest Age (the triangle piece)" (Eleanor Bauer/GoodMove, 2011), "Tentative Assembly (the tent piece)" (Eleanor Bauer/GoodMove, 2012) and "Midday and Eternity (the time piece)" (Eleanor Bauer/GoodMove, 2013). This trilogy utilizes three-fold paradigms such as past-present-future and nature-society-spirituality to approach the holistic nature of dance and choreography. From 2013 to 2016, Eleanor Bauer was an artist-in-residence in the Brussels Kaaitheater. In 2013, she launched "BAUER HOUR" (Eleanor Bauer/GoodMove, 2013), an episodic variété show that ran monthly at the Kaaistudios, toured regularly and is featured on Vimeo. In the autumn of 2015, she developed two "PROTO TALKS" (Eleanor Bauer/GoodMove, 2016) with artists in the Kaaitheater: one with choreographer / dancer Michiel Vandevelde and one with choreographer / dancer <a href="Mette%20Ingvartsen">Mette Ingvartsen</a>. In the spring of 2016, she premiered "Meyoucycle ", a concert performance in collaboration with composer / musician Chris Peck and the contemporary music ensemble <a href="Ictus_Ensemble">Ictus</a>. Both "Meyoucycle" and "Tentative Assembly (the tent piece) " were featured at the Brussels Kunstenfestivaldesarts. Eleanor Bauer and Chris Peck are currently working on "NEW JOY", a new musical theater production that will premiere in February-March 2019 at Schauspielhaus Bochum.

Since 2007 the performances of Eleanor Bauer have been produced by Good Move vzw, an organization that she founded for this purpose in Brussels.

Work as a performer.
As a performer Eleanore Bauer has collaborated with the choreographers <a href="Trisha%20Brown">Trisha Brown</a>, Boris Charmatz, <a href="Anne%20Teresa%20de%20Keersmaeker">Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker</a>/Rosas, <a href="Mette%20Ingvartsen">Mette Ingvartsen</a>, Xavier Le Roy en David Zambrano; the visual artists <a href="Matthew%20Barney">Matthew Barney</a> en <a href="Emily%20Roysdon">Emily Roysdon</a>; the music ensemble Ictus and the electronic music duo <a href="The%20Knife">The Knife</a>.

Work as an author and researcher.
Eleanor Bauer also writes about dance. She published in Off Off Off, New York's <a href="Movement%20Research">Movement Research</a> Performance Journal, Maska (Ljubjana), and NDT of <a href="Contredanse_%28organisation%29">Contredanse</a> (Brussels), as well as in various publications of Sarma, Everybody's, Nadine, and P.A.R.T.S.. For the Sarma project "B-Chronicles" Eleanor Bauer took a series of 46 interviews with artists, critics, producers and dramatic advisers from the Brussels dance community, including herself. The interviews formed an inspiration for events and publications by other project staff, were processed into online records containing a photo, bio, abstract, audio and cartographic drawings. In 2008, she participated in "6M1L" (6 Months 1 Location), a collective research residence initiated by Xavier Le Roy and Bojana Cvejic at CCNM Center Choréographique National Montpellier.

Work as a teacher and mentor.
Eleanor Bauer is also active as a lecturer. In that context she created some performances with students: "Parliament Without Words" (Eleanor Bauer, with students of P.A.R.T.S., 2011), "Another Song" (Eleanor Bauer and Sandy Williams, with students of P.A.R.T.S., 2014), "Medium" (Eleanor Bauer, with students of KASK, 2015), "Being Robert Plutchik" (Eleanor Bauer, with students of KASK, 2015) and "OUROBORACULAR" (Eleanor Bauer, with students of DOCH, School of Dance and Circus, 2017) Together with Vlad Ionescu, she coached the production of "Slogan for Modern Times ", a duet made by Kathryn Vickers and Inga Huld Hákonardóttir in 2015 at wpZimmer, an (inter)national residency space for the performing arts in Antwerp, Belgium.

Inspired by all kinds of <a href="Open-source%20model">open source</a> initiatives, she has set up the project "Nobody's Business" together with the choreographer / dancer Ellen Söderhult and the choreographer / dancer Alice Chauchat. Its purpose is to facilitate the collective production and dissemination of knowledge in the performing arts by sharing practices and documentation about it. In the course of 2015 and 2016, "Nobody's Business" organized nine meetings of approximately five days each in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, the United States and Sweden. Eleanor Bauer was involved as a facilitator in four of these meetings: "Nobody's Dance Stockholm December 2015", "Nobody's Dance Brussels January 2016", "Nobody's Dance Milan April 2016" and "Nobody's Indiscipline Brussels November 2016". For the period 2017-2022, Eleanor Bauer is a PhD candidate in Choreography at the Stockholm University of the Arts, where she also lectures. In 2017 she also gives workshops at b12 (Berlin), <a href="ImPulsTanz%20Vienna%20International%20Dance%20Festival">ImPulsTanz - Vienna International Dance Festival</a> and the Practicing Performance - International Dance Festival at The Ohio State University in Columbus.

Other activities.

In 2011, she participated together with choreographer / dancer Daniel Linehan in the Kaaitheater in "Walk + Talk", a programme series by choreographer / dancer Philipp Gehmacher in which choreographers talk about their movement language. She participated in Hannah Hurtzig's "Black Market for Useful and Non-Useful Knowledge" at the In-Presentable Festival in Madrid in 2012. In 2014, she collaborated with composer Chris Peck on "This is Not a Pop Song (II)", for which the music ensemble Ictus asked five composers to write a new work for instruments that are typically for pop music and that has the length of a pop song, but without the pop music. Together with Chris Peck, she is also involved in heart the band/hear the bend, a performance collective including Beth Gill, Jon Moniaci and Chase Granoff, that has been active since 2004. Under the title "Untitled, Untempered, Untamed, "Eleanor Bauer creates solo performances / lectures involving speaking, dancing, singing, hanging out with the audience, relationships with things that belong to the time and place of the performance, and relationships with things that don’t belong to the time and place of the performance. She was also host of the release of the book "Moving Together: Theorizing and Making Contemporary Dance" by the Belgian cultural sociologist Rudi Laermans at the Kaaistudios in Brussels in 2015.

Mandsaur stone inscription of Yashodharman-Vishnuvardhana

The Mandsaur stone inscription of Yashodharman-Vishnuvardhana, also known as the Mandasor stone inscription of Yashodharman's ministerial family, was written in 532 CE, and records the construction of a well by a person named Daksha in Dashapura (modern <a href="Mandsaur">Mandsaur</a>, also often spelled <a href="Mandasor">Mandasor</a>), during the rule of <a href="Yashodharman">Yashodharman</a>. The inscription had already been removed from the well when identified, but the original well may be the one located just inside of the entrance of modern <a href="Mandsaur%20Fort">Mandsaur Fort</a>. 

The builder of the well, named Daksha, is described as the younger brother of Dharmadosha, himself a minister of Yashodharman.

More importantly, the inscription also mentions the victories of local ruler <a href="Yasodharman">Yasodharman</a> (and possibly <a href="Chalukya">Chalukya</a> ruler <a href="Vishnuvardhana">Vishnuvardhana</a>) over Northern and Eastern kingdoms. These kingdoms are not further specified, but it is known that Yashodhaman occupied most of the territories of the <a href="Alchon%20Huns">Alchon Huns</a> or <a href="Hunas">Hunas</a> to the north, and the most of the territories of the <a href="Gupta%20Empire">Gupta Empire</a> to the east following his victories. Only one more Gupta inscription is known after that date, a land grant in the area of <a href="Kotivarsha">Kotivarsha</a> (<a href="Bangarh">Bangarh</a> in <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a>) by the last Gupta emperor <a href="Vishnugupta%20%28Gupta%20Empire%29">Vishnugupta</a>.The victory against the Alchons Huns is also described in the <a href="Mandsaur%20pillar%20inscription%20of%20Yashodharman">Mandsaur pillar inscription of Yashodharman</a>.

<doc id="54779732" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54779732" title="Compagnie des phosphates de Gafsa">
Compagnie des phosphates de Gafsa

The Compagnie des phosphates de Gafsa (, Gafsa Phosphate Company) or CPG is a Tunisian <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> mining company based in <a href="Gafsa">Gafsa</a>, formed in the late 19th century during the French colonial era, and once the largest employer in the country. 
It was merged in 1994 with the Groupe chimique tunisien (CGT) to form the CPG-CGT group. 
Before the revolution of 2011 the company was the fifth largest phosphate producer in the world, but since then strikes and social unrest have caused production to drop by half.

Foundation.
In April 1885 the French amateur geologist Philippe Thomas discovered rich layers of calcium phosphates on the north slope of Jebel Thelja in the <a href="M%C3%A9tlaoui">Métlaoui</a> region of western Tunisia.
Further geological surveys and explorations found significant phosphate deposits to the south and north of the Île de Kasserine.
The government at first offered a concession to exploit the phosphates only on condition of building a port to export the ore and a railway to carry it from the mines.
There was a lack of interest at first.
After work began on expanding and modernizing the port of <a href="Sfax">Sfax</a> the government dropped the port construction requirement and allowed a concession to mine the ore and transport it by rail to Sfax.
The Compagnie de Phosphate de Gafsa et de Chemin de Fer de Gafsa (CPGCFG, Gafsa Phosphate and Railway Company) was formed in 1897 by a group that included the <a href="Saint%20Gobain">Saint Gobain</a> Chemical Company, Mukhtar Hadid Mining Company, Duparchy Company, several major French industrialists and many small investors.
At the same time construction began of a railway line to link Metlaoui to Sfax.

Colonial era (1899–1956).
The first underground mine was opened in the Metlaoui region in 1899. 
By 1900 annual production of commercial phosphate had reached 200,000 tons.
The second mine at Redéyef was opened in 1903 and the third at Moulares in 1904.
STEPHOS (Société Tunisienne d’Exploitation Phosphatier) was created in 1905.
In 1906 the company had a capital of 18 million francs.
Charles Dollfus-Galline was président and baron <a href="Robert%20de%20Nervo">Robert de Nervo</a> (1842–1909) was vice-président.
The M’dhilla mine was opened in 1920 by the Compagnie des Phosphates Tunisien.

In the early 20th century the plentiful phosphate reserves in Tunisia were second only to those of the United States, and the colonial officials were hopeful that they would revive the economy.
Although annual production reached 2 million tons in the early 1930s, the world price of phosphates dropped soon after exports from Tunisia started, and the forecast earnings were never realized.
However, the Compagnie des Phosphates et Chemins de Fer de Gafsa became the largest employer and taxpayer in the <a href="French%20protectorate%20of%20Tunisia">French protectorate of Tunisia</a>.
The Société Filiale Industriel d’Acide Phosphorique et d’Engrais (SIAPE) began operation on 1948.

Post-independence (1956–2011).
After independence, in 1956 the different subsidiaries of the CPGCFG were progressively nationalized.
In 1962 the Compagnie des Phosphates Tunisien de M’dhilla became entirely Tunisian-owned.
In 1969 the Compagnie des Phosphates Tunisien de M’dhilla merged with the CPGCFG.
In 1976 the STEPHOS and CPGCFG merged under the name of CPG, entirely owned by theTunisian government.
The first open pit mine began operation in Kef Schfaier in 1978.
That year the research center was created.
In the early 1990s with <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> support the company mechanized its operations and concentrated on open pit operations.

In 1994 the CTG merged with the Groupe Chimique Tunisien (GCT), based in <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a>, a public company that converts phosphate into products such as phosphoric acid and fertilizers.
The Tunisian Chemical Group (GCT) is the result of the merger of five phosphate processing companies, namely the Société Industrielle d'Acide Phosphorique et d'Engrais à Sfax, the Industries Chimiques Maghrébines à Gabès, the Société Arabe des Engrais Phosphatés et Azotés à Gabès, the Engrais de Gabès and the Industrie Chimique de Gafsa.
A single general director was named for the CPG and its sister company the GCT.
In 1996 CPG and GCT merged their management structure.
<a href="Mohamed%20Fadhel%20Khalil">Mohamed Fadhel Khalil</a> (died 2017), former Minister of Social Affairs (1992–96), was chief executive officer of the company.

The last underground mine, <a href="Redeyef">Redeyef</a>, closed in 2006.
The CPG is the only large employer in Gafsa.
In January 2008 the company announced that it was cutting local employees from 11,000 to 5,000.
The local branch of the workers' union was occupied by a group of well-educated young people, and tents were pitched on the train tracks leading from the phosphate mines.
The protesters were joined by unemployed people, their relatives, trade unionists and even some CPG staff.
The police blocked the roads and opened fire on the demonstrators.
The government imposed a strict censorship on reporting about the events in the Tunisian media, although some news appeared in the international press.
These events were a precursor to the revolution of 2010–11.

In 2006 a partnership was agreed to form Tunisian Indian Fertilizers (TIFERT) as a joint venture owned 70% by CPG-GCT and 30% by two Indian companies, with the purpose of manufacturing phosphate fertilizers, mainly for export.
The two Indian companies, each with 15%, were <a href="Coromandel%20International">Coromandel International</a> and <a href="Gujarat%20State%20Fertilizers%20and%20Chemicals">Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals</a>.
The partnership entered into force in 2011.
In 2008 Tunisia produced over 1 million tons of <a href="phosphoric%20acid">phosphoric acid</a>, 863 tons of <a href="triple%20super%20phosphate">triple super phosphate</a> (TSP) and 1 million tons of <a href="diammonium%20phosphate">diammonium phosphate</a> (DAP).
By 2010 the company was the fifth largest phosphate producer in the world.
That year the company produced 8 million tons of phosphate and accounted for 10% of Tunisian exports and 4% of the Tunisian GDP.

Post-Tunisian Revolution (2011–present).
After the fall of the <a href="Zine%20El%20Abidine%20Ben%20Ali">Ben Ali regime</a> in January 2011 the company ran into difficulties meeting social demands.
Starting in January 2011 strikes and protest movements organized by the <a href="Tunisian%20General%20Labour%20Union">Tunisian General Labour Union</a> (UGTT) caused a 40% decline in production and loss of international markets, particularly in India.
The company also faced competition from expanded phosphate production in Morocco and new producers in Saudi Arabia and Peru, coupled with declining demand in India and China.
The governments made concessions such as cancelling outsourcing and bringing employees of suppliers into the CPG.
This raised the workforce from 8,000 employees to 30,000 between 2010 and 2014.
At the same time, sit-ins by the unemployed of the region handicapped operations.
In May 2015 the managers and agents of the company suspended administrative and social activities, stopped payments and closed the head office.

A 2016 report noted that the two companies of the CPG-GCT group had a shared management structure, and were releasing little information to the public.
The CPG had never published its financial statements, despite being required to do so by law.
The 1953 mining decree and the mining code do not require publication of details of research and extraction contracts.
There was a lack of public information on the composition and functions of the board of directors and associated committees, and information on the work and reports of internal and external auditors was very limited. There was also a lack of transparency about the management and governance practice of subsidiaries.
Facilities.
As of 2016 the company produced filtered and dried phosphate for the market.
The Gafsa phosphate basin in the southeast of Tunisia on the Algerian border had mining, quarrying and enrichment units.
There were seven open pit mines, one underground mine, and seven washing facilities.
There were five mining sectors:
The company also has licenses in Chott El Jerid in the north and Meknassy in the south of Tunisia.

Joshua Bowen Smith

Joshua Bowen Smith (1813-1879) was an <a href="abolitionist">abolitionist</a>, <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a> conductor, and Massachusetts state legislator who made his living as a caterer in Boston.

Biography.
Joshua Bowen Smith was born in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, in 1813, to an Afro-Indian mother and a British father. He grew up in Philadelphia and was educated on a scholarship from a Quaker philanthropist. In 1836 he moved to Boston, where he became the headwaiter at the dining room of the Mount Washington House hotel. There he became acquainted with two influential abolitionists, Senator <a href="Charles%20Sumner">Charles Sumner</a> and <a href="John%20J.%20Fatal">John J. Fatal</a>. For several years he worked for the catering business of H. R. Thacker before starting his own catering business at the age of 36. 

Over the next 25 years he made a small fortune catering commencement dinners for <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a>, as well as various events for the city, local organizations, and the Union army. Through his work he befriended many other local abolitionists, including <a href="William%20Lloyd%20Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, <a href="George%20Luther%20Stearns">George Luther Stearns</a>, <a href="Robert%20Gould%20Shaw">Robert Gould Shaw</a>, and <a href="Theodore%20Parker">Theodore Parker</a>. 

Smith became involved in the Underground Railroad and was a member of the <a href="Boston%20Vigilance%20Committee">Boston Vigilance Committee</a>. He harbored runaway slaves in his home in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, employed them as cooks and waiters, and often gave them money out of his own pocket as well as weapons and supplies. He was a co-founder of the <a href="New%20England%20Freedom%20Association">New England Freedom Association</a>, a fugitive slave assistance group founded by African Americans.

Smith's catering business suffered a fatal blow in 1861 when Massachusetts Governor <a href="John%20Albion%20Andrew">John Albion Andrew</a> refused to reimburse him for services provided to the <a href="12th%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Infantry">12th Massachusetts Regiment</a> over a 93-day period. Andrew claimed he could not pay the bill because the legislature had not approved the funds, yet he managed to pay all the other caterers who were in the same situation. Smith sued the state in 1879 and received some compensation, but not enough to recoup his legal expenses. He spent the rest of his life in debt.

In 1865, Smith persuaded state officials to commission the <a href="Robert%20Gould%20Shaw%20Memorial">Robert Gould Shaw Memorial</a>, a bronze relief sculpture depicting <a href="Robert%20Gould%20Shaw">Colonel Shaw</a> and the <a href="54th%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Infantry">54th Massachusetts Regiment</a>. In October 1867 he became the first African-American member of the Saint Andrew's Lodge of Freemasons of Massachusetts, and served as junior warden of the Adelphi Lodge in South Boston. From 1873 to 1874, he represented Cambridge in the Massachusetts state legislature, where he served as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. He advised Charles Sumner on his draft of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201875">Civil Rights Act of 1875</a>.

He died in Boston on July 5, 1879, after a prolonged illness, and was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. His former home at 79 Norfolk Street in Cambridge is marked with a plaque installed in 1994 by the Cambridge African American History Project. Smith bought the house in 1852 and lived there with his wife, Emeline, until his death.

Venniyil Govinda Panicker

In the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi a movement started against untouchability in Hindu Society.In Kerala under leadership of K. Kellapan, movement was centered at the Shiva temple at Vaikom, near Kottayam. The Satyagraha aimed at securing freedom of movement for all sections of society through the public roads leading to the Sri Mahadevar Temple at Vaikom. 

Mr.Venniyil Govinda Panicker also known as Kanjikkal Govinda Panicker was the contribution from central travancore for this movement.
A Satyagraha Ashram was set up about one furlong south of the temple. The Ashram was packed with volunteers who came from different parts of the country. The venue of Satyagraha was decided to be on the western road where a prohibitory board announced:

"Ezhavas and other low castes are prohibited through this road"

Hundred of policemen armed with lethal weapons, ready to meet any eventuality, were on the vigil round the clock at the spot where the Satyagraha was to begin.

On the morning of 30 March,1924 a bugle call for action was sounded. The first batch of volunteers selected to offer Satyagraha were Kunjappy (Pulayan), Bahuleyan (Ezhava) and Venniyil Govinda Panicker (Nair). Before leaving the ashram, they were strictly instructed not to offer any resistance and remain calm against all provocations. The Satyagrahis, wearing khadi and Gandhi caps and garlands, marched forward with the Congress flag fluttering before them. All the volunteers followed them shouting "Satyagraha ki jai, Mahatma Gandhi ki jai." All of them would stop at a distance of fifty feet from the notice board, and only the selected three would walk to the point where the prohibition board hung. The police would stop them and ask them their caste. The police would pronounce that the low-caste men would not be allowed to pass; only the Savarnas could. Venniyil Govinda Panicker,the upper-caste men would insist that their companions should go with them. The police would prevent them. The Satyagrahis would wait there patiently until they were arrested just before noon. When they were produced before the court, invariably they were convicted and sentenced to jail and fined. They refused to pay the fine, and courted extra imprisonment. In the evening there would be a procession and public meeting, protesting against the arrest. The meetings were given wide publicity and people thronged in from all directions. They returned, rejuvenated by the inspiring speeches of the leaders to come back again next morning to start the routine.

Mr Panicker was arrested by police at the age of 25.Panicker was the co-brother of Dr. K.V Panicker (First Vicitim of chenganoor dynamite case against British).

For Indian National Congress Mr.Venniyil Govinda Panicker was the Mandalam President also DCC Member.Panicker born in mannar but his workplace was always chennithala. Venniyil Govinda Panicker was one of the founder of Mahatma High School Chennithala.

Mr Panicker always aimed to fight for the right to the backward community eventhough his wellwisher's were against his thought's. At the age of 78 on 1972 panicker passed away. His family consist's of his wife Mavelikara,Cherukole Venniyil Late LekshmiKutty Amma,9 childrens Kizhakan Othera Maliyil Late Damodharan Pillai,Bhavani amma(Sankara Sadanam,Cherukole), Late Karunakaran Pillai(Anna Nagar,Chennai),Late Bhagirathi amma,Orippram Vadayathu edakethil Late Lambodharan Pillai(Mathrubhumi Agent,Chennithala),Late Rajamma(Varma's Building Chennithala),Late Gopinathapillai(Idukki),Kizhakevazhi arayathil GopalaKrishna Pillai(Ex-service,Chennithala) and Venniyil Ramachandran Pillai(Cherukole).

Cyclone Maarutha

Cyclone Maarutha was the first tropical cyclone to form during the <a href="2017%20North%20Indian%20Ocean%20cyclone%20season">2017 North Indian Ocean cyclone season</a>. It was a relatively short lived and weak <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a> but was the first ever landfalling cyclone on <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> in the month of <a href="April">April</a>. Although a weak system but it caused some notable damage in <a href="Myanmar%20">Myanmar </a>. Maarutha formed from an area of Low Pressure over south Bay of Bengal on April 15. 

The next morning at (0000 UTC) of 15th April, RSMC New Delhi upgraded the low pressure area to a Depression and designated it as BOB 01. Moving northeastwards, it intensified into a deep depression over eastcentral Bay of Bengal in the afternoon of 15th and into a cyclonic storm “MAARUTHA” over eastcentral Bay of Bengal in the midnight of 15th. Further moving northeastwards, it reached its peak intensity in the early hours of 16th. The system maintained its peak intensity till evening of 16th. Moving nearly 
northeastwards, it crossed <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> coast near Sandoway (Thandwe) in the 
midnight. After landfall, the system weakened into a Deep Depression in the early hours of 17th, into a Depression in the morning and well marked low pressure area over central Myanmar and neighbourhood in the forenoon of 17th and dissipated thereafter. The name "Maarutha" is contributed by <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.

Meteorological history.
An upper air cyclonic circulation developed over south Andaman Sea & neighbourhood extending up to 3.1 km above mean sea level on 11th April. Moving nearly northeastwards, it concentrated into a trough of low over Andaman & Nicobar Islands and neighbourhood on 12th. It lay as a low pressure area over southeast BOB and neighbourhood with upper air cyclonic circulation extending up to 5.8 km above mean sea level in the evening of 13th. It became a well marked low pressure area in the early hours of 14th over the same region. It concentrated into a depression in the early hours of 15th over southeast BOB. At 0000 UTC of 15th the sea surface temperature (SST) around the region of depression was 30-320C. The ocean thermal energy was about 100 KJ/cm2. The vertical wind shear was about 10-20 knots (moderate) around the system centre. There was favourable poleward outflow in association with the anti-cyclonic circulation lying to the souheast of the system centre. Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) was in Phase 7 with amplitude less than 1. Hence the environmental conditions were favourable for genesis, except MJO.

Moving northeastwards, it intensified into a deep depression over eastcentral Bay of Bengal in the afternoon of 15th and into a cyclonic storm (CS) “MAARUTHA” over eastcentral in the Bay of Bengal midnight of 15th. Under the favourable lower level convergence & vorticity, upper level divergence enhanced by poleward outflow due to an anticyclonic circulation in the southeast of system centre and a trough in mid latitude westerlies around 800E and incursion of warm moist air from southeast towards the system centre, the system gradually intenisfied into a CS. At1500 UTC (11 a.m. EST) the Joint Typhoon Warning Center warned that multispectral satellite imagery depicts a rapidly consolidating system with formative banding (of thunderstorms) wrapping into the low level circulation center.However, strong vertical wind shear and unfavourable MJO inhibited rapid intensification or further 
intensification of the system. Moving northeastwards, it reached its peak intensity of winds 75 km/h and a minimum central pressure of 996 hpa (mbar) in the early hours of 16th. The radar imagery from the coast indicated there was a formative eye feature in the storm's center. The system maintained its peak intensity till landfall near Sandoway (Thandwe) in the midnight. On April 16 at 2100 UTC (5 p.m. EST), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued their final warning on Maarutha. After landfall, the system weakened into a Deep Depression in early hours of 17th, into a Depression in the morning and well marked low pressure area over central Myanmar and neighbourhood in the forenoon of 17th.

Preparations.
Myanmar.
The Union Minister for Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, the Vice President, ministers and disaster response team of Myanmar had an emergency meeting on the morning of 16th April to prepare rescue teams as well as stock up on food and water in disaster zones.The National Disaster Preparedness Central Committee said that it has sent in emergency materials for up to 2,000 families.In Magwe, the regional government has asked religious visitors and shopkeepers at the Shwe Sattaw pagoda to evacuate as the site is unsafe.

Bangladesh.
When the depression over East-central Bay of Bengal has turned into the tropical cyclone 'Maarutha' the Met office in <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> to advise distant warning signal No. 2 for maritime ports in Bangladesh.All fishing boats and trawlers over North Bay and deep sea had been advised to remain close to the coast and proceed with caution. 

Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
The National Disaster Management Authority of India informed that sea condition would be very rough along and off Andaman Islands on 16th of April.It also advised fishermen not to venture into sea.

Impact and aftermath.
Myanmar.
A total of 81 houses, worth about Ks3.7 million were damaged by the storm. There were three houses which were destroyed by fallen trees. Six lamp posts collapsed and broken. Some houses had superficial damage as coconut palm collapsed on parts of them.Cyclone Maarutha’s winds caused damage in Kyaukpyu on Sunday, including one of the eight rooms in the internally displaced persons (IDP) building, causing a loss of Ks4.5 lakhs. The cyclone also caused damage in 70 households in eight villages, two medical facilities, two schools, one departmental building and two monasteries, resulting a total loss of Ks22,460,000 in Yanbye Township. In 18 villages in Manaung Township, damage occurred at six schools, two monasteries, the general hospital, seven households and other buildings, resulting in damages totalling Ks 4,864,000.Total losses in the district was Ks31,824,000.Heavy rain as a result of Maarutha created flash floods in Magwe Division, where at least ten acres of farmland has been deemed devastated.The Myanmar Meteorological Agency noted that accumulated rainfall for the 24 hours before April 17 at 9:30 a.m. local time totaled 3.7 inches (96 mm) for Bago. The town of Pyay received 5.4 inches (139 mm). In the Rahkine Region, the city of Kyauckpyu received 4.6 inches (119 mm) of rainfall in a 24 hour period. In the Mon State, Thaton, a town in in southern Myanmar received 4.3 inches (111 mm) of rainfall from Maarutha. Four people were reported to be killed in the Irrawady division of Myanmar.

India.
Cyclone Maarutha, as a deep depression, left hundreds of tourists stranded in Havelock Island of <a href="Andaman%20and%20Nicobar%20Islands">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a> by causing heavy rainfall. 
Due to a heavy swell in the sea around the Andaman Islands and bad weather, all ferries to Havelock Island from Port Blair were suspended on16th of April leaving nearly 1,500 tourists stranded.

In the states of <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> and <a href="Odisha">Odisha</a>, heatwave conditions worsened as the cyclone drew all the moisture towards itself resulting in severe hot and dry weather.

DragonBox

DragonBox is an <a href="educational%20game">educational game</a> developed and published by WeWantToKnow AS, and released on May 9, 2012 for <a href="iOS">iOS</a>. It was created to teach children math, such as <a href="algebra">algebra</a>.

The game won a 2016 <a href="Games%20for%20Change">Games For Change</a> award for "Best Learning Game", and received positive reception from critics, who praised the efficacy of the app.

Gameplay.
The game has five "worlds" with twenty levels each, and beating each level allows the dragons that the player possesses to grow into a new, more advanced form. To beat each level, the player must play a puzzle minigame in which they organize cards on two trays. While the cards are initially icons of various creatures and objects, the game uses them to abstractly demonstrate mathematical equations before later replacing them with variables and numbers. The player gets bonus stars if they complete the level in as few moves as possible, and with as few cards left as possible.

Development.
The co-founder and CEO of the game's studio is Jean-Baptiste Huyhn, a former math teacher who was frustrated with the way math was taught in schools and wanted to teach it in a way that made more sense to children. He started the We Want to Know studio with the goal of making educational games that were actually fun to play. The game was programmed by Zoran Popovic, a computer scientist who also created the video game <a href="Foldit">Foldit</a>.

Reception.
The game received positive reception from critics, with Jonathan H. Liu of "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" commenting on how his children "loved" the game despite its heavy mathematical focus. He stated that it "makes algebra so fun and easy to learn that my kids fight over who gets to play it". Stephanie Fogel of <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> called the game something every developer should study, quoting <a href="Nicholas%20Fortugno">Nicholas Fortugno</a> saying the educational elements are "elegant and hidden, the way good educational games should be".

Ann Elliott of Edudemic called the game "intuitive" and user-friendly. Adam Renfro of Getting Smart called the game "a shining example [...] of what gamification should look like". Jordan Shapiro in "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" said he was "astonished" at how quickly his son learned algebraic equations, and was blown away.

<a href="Channing%20Tatum">Channing Tatum</a> and <a href="Jon%20Ronson">Jon Ronson</a> present the show as if it were an actual influential Romanian television show from the 1980s. Produced by the <a href="Romanian%20Communist%20Party">Romanian communist government</a> it served as Communist propaganda. Lost over the years, producers recently found surviving copies of the episodes. With the help of the fictional Romanian Film Preservation Society they have restored the episodes and <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dubbed</a> them into English.

Within the show hard-boiled but troubled <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> police detective Gregor Anghel and his partner respond to a drug bust against the orders of their Captain. This results in a man in a <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> mask killing his partner in front of him. Anghel, along with his new partner from the countryside Iosif Baciu, must solve his partner's murder. In doing so, they uncover an insidious <a href="Western%20world">western</a> plot to indoctrinate communist society with capitalism and religion.

Cast.
Each character is portrayed by a Romanian actor, as well as an English-language voice actor. The show was first filmed using Romanian actors speaking <a href="Romanian%20language">Romanian</a>. Actors then over-dubbed every role in English.



Production.
When first conceiving the series, executive producer Channing Tatum asked the creators to bring him the worst ideas they could think of, with the reasoning "When you try to find something that is not working, you figure out what’s cool about it, and you can find some really hidden gems.” Gatewood and Tanaka pitched a satire series that spoofed Communist propaganda from the 1980s. The two had become fascinated with Soviet propaganda television after seeing a mid-80s <a href="PBS">PBS</a> documentary on Soviet broadcasts. They initially looked into dubbing over real <a href="Eastern%20bloc">Eastern bloc</a> television shows but realized it would be easier to make their own show rather than procure the rights.

The series takes inspiration from the <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>n show <a href="Thirty%20Cases%20of%20Major%20Zeman">Thirty Cases of Major Zeman</a>. They also took inspiration from the idea that growing up, American 80s movies like <a href="Red%20Dawn">Red Dawn</a> served as both entertainment and propaganda. It also took inspiration from the <a href="East%20Germany">East German</a> series <a href="Polizeiruf%20110">Polizeiruf 110</a> and the American film <a href="Lethal%20Weapon">Lethal Weapon</a>. By making the propaganda and inaccuracies obvious to a western audience, they hoped to make the subtle nature of modern propaganda more clear. Tanaka stated that the goal was to create the inverse Soviet equivalent of the type of Russian-villain entertainment common in 1980s America.

The creative team first wrote the episodes in English, then translated it to Romanian. They then filmed the show in Romania with Romanian actors. Other than the <a href="director%20of%20photography">director of photography</a>, writers, and director the entire cast and crew were locally sourced in Romania. The English-language actors were only cast after the series had been filmed and edited in its entirety.

Reception.
Comrade Detective received mostly positive reactions from critics. <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> indicated that 73% of critics gave the series a positive review. On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> the series received a score of 66 out of 100 based on 12 critics. Ben Travers of <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> gave the show a positive review, calling it a sharp satire. He focused in on the show's goal of deconstruction propaganda, claiming, "They’re not simply here to make you laugh. They’re not here to upset you. They’re here to make you think differently and enjoy your time doing it. By that gauge, “Comrade Detective” is a roaring success. By the basic metric of thoroughly engaging television, it’s still a winner." James Poniewozik of the <a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a> gave it a less enthusiastic review, claiming that the show committed too much to its initial joke and ran too long. He concluded, "It's a brilliant idea. But it's not much more than an idea."

Uganda v Commissioner of Prisons, Ex Parte Matovu

"Also see" <a href="Ghosts%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Law">Ghosts & the Law</a>
Uganda v. Commissioner of Prisons, Ex Parte Michael Matovu, [1966] 1 EA 514, is a decision of the High Court of Uganda in which <a href="Hans%20Kelsen">Hans Kelsen</a>'s ""General Theory on Law and State"" and the <a href="Political%20question">Political Question Doctrine</a> were considered in determining the legal validity of <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>'s 1966 Constitution. The 1966 Constitution had come into place following what was by and large, a coup d'etat executed by <a href="Milton%20Obote">Apollo Milton Obote</a> when he seized all powers of government and suspended Uganda's 1962 Independence Constitution, eventually leading to its abolition. 

Facts.
On February 22, 1966, Uganda’s Prime Minister, Apollo Milton Obote, issued a statement to the nation in which he announced that he had assumed all powers of government in the interest of “national stability, public security and tranquility”. Two days later, he suspended the 1962 Constitution of Uganda. However, the parts of the Constitution relating to, inter alia; the courts, the civil service, the armed forces and the National Assembly were preserved for continuity of the basic functioning of the state.
On April 15, 1966, Uganda's National Assembly abolished the 1962 Constitution by resolution and replaced it with the 1966 Constitution to be in force pending the establishment of a Constituent Assembly to draft and pass a new Constitution (this later came to be the 1967 Constitution). Under the new Constitution, all executive authority was vested in the President, in this case Apollo Milton Obote, to be exercised with the advice and consent of cabinet. Former President, Sir Edward Mutesa was consequently evicted from the State House and eventually forced to flee into exile. The new Constitution also abolished the federal states that had been created by its predecessor.
The Applicant in this case, Michael Matovu, also the Saza Chief of Buddu in Buganda Kingdom, was arrested on May 22, 1966, and detained at Masindi Prison under the provisions of the Deportation Ordinance. He was subsequently transferred to Luzira Prison in Buganda Kingdom.
On May 23, 1966, a state of emergency was declared in Buganda Kingdom by proclamation and this was later confirmed by the National Assembly which also passed new legislation governing such states of emergency in form of the Emergency Powers Act and the Emergency Powers (Detention) Regulations.
Michael Matovu was released from prison on July 16, 1966 and ordered to leave. However, he was re-arrested upon stepping outside the Prison and consequently re-detained, this time under the emergency powers laws.
The Minister of Internal Affairs ordered his detention on August 10, 1966, and the said detention order was served on him in prison the next day. A fortnight later, he appeared before a tribunal for review of his case.
On September 6, 1966, Michael Matovu filed, through his advocate, what purported to be an application for the prerogative writ of habeas corpus under Section 349 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Uganda. However, his application involved the need to answer various questions requiring constitutional interpretation and so the presiding judge, Jeffreys Jones, J, referred the matter to a 3 member bench of the Court (Udo Udoma, CJ; Sheridan and Jeffreys Jones, JJ) for hearing and determination of the Constitutional questions (not the application for the writ of habeas corpus per se). 
The issues for determination revolved about the competence of the Application, the Constitutional validity of the emergency powers laws and therefore by extension, the constitutionality or legal validity of Michael Matovu's detention.
The most important issue however, and the core of this precedent, turned out to be the question of the 1966 Constitution's validity. No doubt, the roots of this 1966 Constitution lay in an extra-constitutional act to wit, a coup d'etat or revolution perpetrated by Apollo Milton Obote when he seized all powers of government.

Holding.
"Jettisoning formalism to the winds".
In the first instance, the Court overlooked what would ordinarily be grave errors in the original application by Michael Matovu such as failure to file a notice of motion, name a proper respondent and reliance on defective affidavits. It considered that the liberty of a citizen was at stake and so decided to let substance prevail over form.

"“Indeed but for the fact that the application concerns the liberty of a citizen, the court would have been justified in holding that there was no application properly before it. In the first place the affidavits as intituled and headed are defective. There is no respondent named against whom the writ is sought and to whom the writ should issue.”"

Political Question Doctrine.
The Court also heard arguments in respect of the validity of the 1966 Constitution. The Attorney General of Uganda argued that the question of validity of the Constitution was a <a href="Political%20question">Political question</a> which the court was precluded from inquiring into as it was a matter properly within the exclusive province of the other branches of government. For this proposition, decisions sch as <a href="Luther%20v.%20Borden">Luther v. Borden</a> and <a href="Marbury%20v.%20Madison">Marbury v. Madison</a> from the United States were relied upon.
The Court, while accepting that the Political Question Doctrine was a sound and applicable doctrine, declined to hold the view that the validity of the 1966 Constitution was a political question. In its view, it was vested with power to interpret the Constitution and this power involved inquiring into the validity of a new Constitution rather than resigning that duty to co-ordinate branches of government.
The Court also seemingly differentiated between questioning the validity of government and questioning the validity of the Constitution. It opined that it had no power to do the former but could do the latter. A thin line, however, stands between the two concepts and it is difficult to fathom a substantial difference between them.
Nevertheless, the Court was seeking to determine which Constitution was the reigning, supreme law of the land. Was it the 1962 Independence Constitution, or the 1966 Constitution? For no two Constitutions could simultaneously exist and additionally, the judges were, as a result of their judicial oaths the oath of allegiance, bound to uphold and protect the Constitution of Uganda as by law established.
This particular argument thus failed as the Court did not view the validity of the Constitution per se, as a political question. 

The Kelsen theory argument.
Having rejected the submission that the validity of the 1966 Constitution was a political question, the Court heard an alternative argument that incorporated Hans Kelsen's theory on how change in a state's basic norm may effectively create a new and valid legal order to replace the state's former legal order, thereby creating a new binding legal regime.

The Attorney General submitted that under International Law, an independent and sovereign nation may have its government or Constitution changed by way of a coup d’état, where an abrupt political change destroys a pre-existing legal order and effectively replaces it in a manner that pre-existing legal order did not itself contemplate. It was thus argued that the suspension of the 1962 Constitution and seizure of all powers of government by Apollo Milton Obote in February 1962 was in fact a coup d’état. Added to this were the events of ejecting former President and Head of State (Sir Edward Mutesa) from the State House and in fact his subsequent escape beyond the territorial boundaries of Uganda coupled with inter alia, the abolition of federal states, closure of appeals to the Privy Council and the elimination of the High Court of Buganda. The apex of these events was of course the effective assumption by Apollo Milton Obote of the Executive Office of President. It was put to the Court that a coup d'etat or revolution had occurred in Uganda, destroying the legal order underlying the 1962 Constitution and establishing the new legal order under which the 1966 Constitution was validly established. Reference was also made to how the new Constitution was effective, having been accepted by the masses as the new law. Further reliance was sought on the Pakistani Supreme Court decision of "the state v. Dosso" where the Kelsen theory was applied in a similar circumstance.

Kelsen's theory.
Kelsen’s theory postulates that a “legal order” (basic norm) underlies every legal system which in turn consists of legal norms (binding rules of conduct). A legal order (basic norm) determines legal norms, which are valid as long as they are in accordance with the legal order establishing them. Legal Norms under a legal system may include periodic elections by which power is successively transferred, for example. Abiding by legal norms begets legitimacy and defying them creates illegitimacy. The legal order or basic norm however, is the hypothetical, whole underlying basis for a legal government. In essence, it is the source or point of origin of all law and authority in the state; the very foundation of validity.
Kelsen stated that a change in a state’s “legal order” or basic norm by way of revolution or coup d’état, which is a means not within the contemplation of the deposed legal order or system, creates a new valid government or Constitution if only the new legal order is efficacious in terms of control and recognition. Even when some of the legal content or legal norms of the deposed regime, for example preexisting laws, are preserved, they are in effect new norms because the reason for their validity has changed. Only their content is identical to the old norms.
"″No jurist would maintain that even after a successful revolution the old constitution and the laws based thereupon remain in force, on the ground that they have not been nullified in a manner anticipated by the old order itself. Every jurist will presume that the old order – to which no political reality any longer corresponds – has ceased to be valid, and that all norms, which are valid within the new order, receive their validity exclusively from the new constitution. It follows that, from this juristic point of view the norms of the old order can no longer be recognized as valid norms.″" – Kelsen.

Kelsen emphasized that a new legal order must be effective in order to be valid, otherwise it becomes an illegality under the “still-valid” legal order it has failed to depose, exposing its perpetrators or architects to inter alia, treason charges.
Kelsen additionally theorized that in international law, a revolution or coup d’etat is a valid way of changing a government as long as the new legal order has effective control over the same territory as the one before it to the end that the identity of the State in question remains the same under international jurisprudence. Only its government changes, albeit through what domestically in that state, is an “illegal” means when you consider the deposed legal order’s stipulations as to what is permissible as a mode of assuming power. On the international scene however, the new government becomes legitimate while the identity of the state remains the same.

"″…by international law…the legal order remains the same as long as its territorial sphere of validity remains essentially the same, even if the order should be changed in another way than that prescribed by the Constitution, in the way of a revolution or coup d’etat. A victorious revolution or a successful coup d’etat does not destroy the identity of the legal order which it changes. The order established by revolution or coup d’etat has to be considered as a modification of the old order, not as a new order, if this order is valid for the same territory. The government brought into permanent power by a revolution or coup d’etat is, according to international law, the legitimate government of the State, whose identity is not affected by these events. Hence, according to international law, victorious revolutions or successful coups d’etat are to be interpreted as procedures by which a national legal order can be changed. Both events are, viewed in the light of international law, law creating fact. Again injuria jus oritur: and it is again the principle of effectiveness that is applied.″"

In "the state v Dosso", the Supreme Court of Pakistan applied Kelsen’s theory to determine that the Pakistani President’s annulment of the 1956 Constitution of Pakistan and his imposition or declaration of martial law in 1958 amounted to a revolution that established a new legal order under which the law was to now be derived. Three days after annulling the 1956 Pakistani Constitution, the President had promulgated an order, the Laws (Continuance in Force) Order, which validated previous laws except the Constitution within the new legal order. Importantly, even the fundamental human rights that had been enshrined within Pakistan's 1956 Constitution were deemed to also have been excluded from the new legal order.
The Court (in ex parte Matovu) concluded that the Kelsenian principle was equally applicable in the case of Uganda and held that the 1966 Constitution was thus valid because it was the product of a successful revolution which had led to a new legal order, ousting that of the 1962 Constitution.

"″Applying the Kelsenian principles, which incidentally form the basis of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the above case, our deliberate and considered view is that the 1966 Constitution is a legally valid constitution and the supreme law of Uganda; and that the 1962 Constitution having been abolished as a result of a victorious revolution in law does no longer exist nor does it now form part of the Laws of Uganda, it having been deprived of its de facto and de jure validity. The 1966 Constitution, we hold, is a new legal order and has been effective since April 14, 1966, when it first came into force.″"

The Court also accepted various affidavits of key government officials as sufficiently demonstrative of the acceptance by the people, of the new legal order and hence equally demonstrative of its efficacy. Emphasis was laid on one particular affidavit, sworn by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in which it was stated that all foreign countries with which Uganda had relations had recognized the new government or legal order.

The Court drew a distinction between recognition of a new Head of State and the recognition of a new State all together.
It however concluded that it was beyond its province to ‘accord recognition to the government’ of its own country; that it was obliged merely to abide by the Constitution, which Constitution originates its (the Court’s) own existence and which Constitution exists only because the State supersedes it (the Constitution) in existence. That is to say, there can be no Constitution without a State. This appears to be a final reiteration of the Political Question Doctrine. The Court, in essence, was saying that legality of government, as opposed to legality of the Constitution, was beyond its scope of jurisdiction. Although, again, it is difficult to see how determination of Constitutional Validity is not a determination of legality of government.

"″We would like to emphasize, however, that the question of the recognition of the new Head of State of Uganda by foreign nations is not strictly within the scope of this enquiry. For, in our view it is not within the province of this court, nor is it within its competence to accord recognition to the government or international status of the government of this country which is our own country. Courts, legislatures and the law derive their origins from the constitution, and therefore the constitution cannot derive its origin from them, because there can be no law unless there is already a state whose law it is, and there can be no state without a constitution.″"

Significance.
"Uganda v. Commissioner of Prisons, Ex Parte Matovu," commenced and sowed the seeds for the advent of the <a href="Political%20question">Political question</a> Doctrine in Uganda. It has subsequently been applied in landmark decisions such as "Attorney General v. Major General David Tinyefunza", Constitutional Appeal No. 1 of 1997, wherein it was extensively applied by Justice George Wilson Kanyeihamba to distance the Court from the affairs of the army and the Executive authority over it, save in a few select, necessary cases; and "IPPR v the Attorney General", Miscellaneous Application No.592 of 2014, in which the Applicant sought an injunction to bar the Ugandan government from enabling or sponsoring the exportation of qualified Ugandan medical doctors and nurses to Trinidad and Tobago.
The Doctrine's effect has however been greatly curtailed, and nearly wiped out (seemingly) by the recent Supreme Court decision in "CEHURD v the Attorney General", an appeal from the Country's Constitutional Court's decision in "CEHURD v the Attorney General", Constitutional Petition No. 16 of 2011.

John F. O'Donnell (lawyer)

John F. O'Donnell (died 1993) was an Irish-born 20th-Century American "leading labor lawyer" who represented the national Transport Workers Union (TWU) (now <a href="Transport%20Workers%20Union%20of%20America">Transport Workers Union of America</a>) and <a href="American%20Postal%20Workers%20Union">American Postal Workers Union</a> (APWU) and also "played a central role in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s transit strikes" from the 1930s to the 1980s.

Background.
O'Donnell was born in <a href="Donegal%2C%20Ireland">Donegal, Ireland</a>. He had one brother and two sisters. His support for the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army">Irish Republican Army</a> led to run-ins with British authorities, so he moved to New York City at age 20.

He studied first at <a href="City%20College%20of%20New%20York">City College of New York</a> (CCNY) and then earned a law degree from <a href="Fordham%20University">Fordham University</a> in 1937. He attended night classes. By day, he worked variously as elevator operator, grocery clerk, teacher of delinquents, and editorial writer for "<a href="The%20Irish%20Echo">The Irish Echo</a>".

Career.
In the 1930s, O'Donnell became aide and friend to (then) City Councilman <a href="Michael%20J.%20Quill">Michael J. Quill</a>, who went on to co-found the <a href="Transport%20Workers%20Union%20of%20America">Transport Workers Union</a> and became its president.

O'Donnell & Schwartz.
In 1948 he and Asher Schwartz formed a law partnership in Manhattan (and in 1981 formed an affiliated law firm in Washington), for labor law and union clients.

Over the years, he partook in many "tense" transit negotiations, including the 11-day <a href="1980%20New%20York%20City%20transit%20strike">1980 New York City transit strike</a>.

In 1990, O'Donnell was still serving as general counsel to the Transport Workers Union, as indicated in his letter of December 18, 1990, to the "New York Times", in which he voiced support for a strike by the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" "wholeheartedly."

Clients.
O'Donnell served as general counsel for the <a href="Transport%20Workers%20Union%20of%20America">Transport Workers Union</a> from 1948. He also served as top lawyer for the <a href="American%20Postal%20Workers%20Union">American Postal Workers Union</a>. Other clients included: <a href="International%20Brotherhood%20of%20Electrical%20Workers">International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers</a> - Utilities Division - Local 3, <a href="Communications%20Workers%20of%20America">Communications Workers of America</a> - Locals 1101 and 1105, and <a href="Retail%2C%20Wholesale%20and%20Department%20Store%20Workers%20Union">Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union</a> - Local 1S. (Schwartz served as counsel to the <a href="Newspaper%20%26amp%3B%20Mail%20Deliverers%20Union">Newspaper & Mail Deliverers Union</a> of New York and vicinity.)

Successes.
Successes for the firm included:

1980 New York City transit strike.
"See <a href="1980%20New%20York%20City%20transit%20strike">1980 New York City transit strike</a>"

As chief counsel, O'Donnell represented Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union during negotiations with the <a href="New%20York%20Transit%20Authority">New York Transit Authority</a> when <a href="Ed%20Koch">Ed Koch</a> was mayor of New York City. The strike had grown out of problems unresolved in the 1970s, largely over wages and the right (or not) to strike at all.

During the strike, O'Donnell stated: (The TWU's "no contract no work policy") isn't set in concrete. The union has to adopt to changing circumstances and a changing world. The no contract, no work policy was adopted at a time when we had a lot of private employers and it never was carried out in every instance... (Still), we would have as much right to strike as before. He also noted that TWU had never held any "right" to strike because, in New York, strikes by public employees are illegal. (Partner Schwartz also addressed the issue of right to strike by public employees and to collective bargaining.)

Members.
In 1972, members of the law firm included: O'Donnell, partner Ashter W. Schwartz, Michael Klein, Robert J. Dryfoos, George Maxwell, Sylvan Schwartz, Elaine LoSquadro, Joan Siegel, Nancy Harber, and Phyllis Longhi

Another member was <a href="Manlio%20DiPreta">Manlio DiPreta</a>, who started his career with O'Donnell & Schwartz and negotiated three key contracts with New York's Transit Authority in the 1990s.

Personal and death.
O'Donnell married Gwendolyn Large. They had one son and three daughters.

"Mr. O'Donnell was known among labor insiders for his gargantuan cigars, Irish brogue, meticulous preparation and articulate presentation," reported the "New York Times" at his time of death.

He died of cancer at Northern Westchester Hospital in <a href="Mount%20Kisco%2C%20New%20York">Mount Kisco, New York</a>, on January 28, 1993. His wife Gwynne died in 2004.

Legacy.
<a href="Theodore%20W.%20Kheel">Theodore W. Kheel</a>, labor mediator, said of O'Donnell: "Some people specialize in problems, but he always was looking for the solutions."

Pachycondyla succinea

Pachycondyla succinea is an <a href="extinct">extinct</a> species of ant in the <a href="Formicidae">formicid</a> subfamily <a href="Ponerinae">Ponerinae</a> described from fossils found in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. "P. petrosa" is one of three middle Eocene "<a href="Pachycondyla">Pachycondyla</a>" species found in <a href="Baltic%20amber">Baltic amber</a>.

History and classification.
When described "Pachycondyla succinea" was known only from three queen fossils which were fossilized as <a href="Inclusion%20%28mineral%29">inclusions</a> in transparent chunks of <a href="Baltic%20amber">Baltic amber</a> which are now presumed lost. Additional queens have since been found in Baltic, <a href="Rovno%20amber">Rovno</a>, and <a href="Scandinavian%20amber">Scandinavian amber</a>. Males were later identified from Baltic and <a href="Bitterfeld%20amber">Bitterfeld amber</a>s.

Baltic amber is approximately forty six million years old, having been deposited during <a href="Lutetian">Lutetian</a> stage of the <a href="Middle%20Eocene">Middle Eocene</a>. There is debate on what plant family the amber was produced by, with macrofossil and microflossil evidence suggesting a "<a href="Pinus">Pinus</a>" relative, while chemical and spectroscopic evidence suggests "<a href="Agathis">Agathis</a>" or "<a href="Sciadopitys">Sciadopitys</a>". The paleoenvironment of the Eocene Baltic forests where the "P. eocenicum" lived was that of humid temperate to subtropical islands. The forests were composed of mostly "<a href="Quercus">Quercus</a>" and "Pinus" species, while the lower sections of the forests had paratropical plant elements, such as <a href="Arecaceae">palms</a>. Rovno amber, recovered from deposits in the <a href="Rivne">Rivne</a> region of <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, is slightly younger in age, being dated to the <a href="Bartonian">Bartonian</a> to <a href="Priabonian">Priabonian</a> of the <a href="Late%20Eocene">Late Eocene</a>. Bitterfeld amber is recovered from coal deposits in the Saxony area of Germany and the dating of the deposits is uncertain. Bitterfeld represents a section of the Eocene <a href="Paratethys%20Sea">Paratethys Sea</a>, and the amber that is recovered from the region is thought to be redeposited from older sediments. The fossil record of Bitterfeld and Baltic amber insects is very similar with a number of shared species, and that similarity is noted in the suggestions of a single source for the paleoforest that produced the amber. The amber deposits on the Danish coast, often referred to as Scandinavian amber, is of similar age to the other three European ambers, however a study of the ant fauna publushed in 2009 indicates Scandinavian amber has a fairly distinct ant assemblage.

The species was first described in 1868 by Austrian entomologist <a href="Gustav%20Mayr">Gustav Mayr</a> based on three queens. He named the species and placed it into the genus "<a href="Ponera">Ponera</a>" as "Ponera succinea". The species was redescribed in 1915 by <a href="William%20Morton%20Wheeler">William Morton Wheeler</a> based on a group of 21 queens, including one of Mayrs three original syntypes. Based on the queens examined, Wheeler moved the species to the genus "<a href="Euponera">Euponera</a>" as "Euponera (Trachymesopus) succinea". The placement was unchanged until 1995 when "Euponera " was <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29%23Zoology">synonymized</a> with "<a href="Pachycondyla">Pachycondyla</a>" by <a href="Barry%20Bolton">Barry Bolton</a>. "Pachycondyla" was split into a number of genera in 2014 with with most of the extant species being placed into other genera, but a series of fossil species including "P. succinea" were not moved. Schmidt and Shattuck in the revision of the genus noted that many of the fossil species were not moved due to specimens not being examined by them, and that the placement of the species was "undoubtedly incorrect". Males of the species were first formally described in 2009, based on specimens preserved in Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers. 

"P. succinea" is one of three "Pachycondyla" species described from Baltic amber, the other two being "<a href="Pachycondyla%20baltica">Pachycondyla baltica</a>" and "<a href="Pachycondyla%20gracillicornis">Pachycondyla gracillicornis</a>". In addition to these species, one species is known from Rovno amber, "<a href="Pachycondyla%20conservata">Pachycondyla conservata</a>", and one species is known from Bitterfeld amber, "<a href="Pachycondyla%20tristis">Pachycondyla tristis</a>".

Description.
The queens have a body length of , with dense pitting along the all the body excluding the <a href="Gaster%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">gaster</a>, which is smooth. There are hairs spread evenly over the body with a mix of <a href="decumbent">decumbent</a>, erect, and partially erect hairs. The flat laying and partially erect hairs of the gaster are longer then the space between adjacent hairs. The head is rectangular in outline with distinctly developed rear corners, a concave rear margin, and small distinct <a href="Simple%20eye%20in%20invertebrates%23Dorsal%20ocelli">ocelli</a>. The <a href="compound%20eyes">compound eyes</a>, slightly bulged out with oval outlines, are placed far forward on the head, shortening the <a href="Glossary_of_entomology_terms%23G.E2.80.93L">gena</a> to shorter then the eye diameter. The antennae are composed of 12 segments, with the basal and tip segments longer then wide, while the rest are shorter then wide. The bottom most segment, the scape, is longer then the other antenna segments, but does not reach the rear edge of the head. There are six teeth on the chewing face of the mandibles, and no external tooth on the outer margin.

The males are smaller then the queens, with a total body length between and an overall shiny exoskeleton. There are longitudinal ridges on the <a href="propodem">propodem</a> sides, while the <a href="Petiole%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">petiole</a> is smooth. There is dense pitting on the head and sparser pitting is present on the gaster and mesosoma. Many upright hairs are found on the gaster, petiole scale, upper surface of the mesosoma, and on the head. Decumbent hairs are present over the whole exoskeleton, showing most distinctly on the gaster, where the hairs are "several times" longer then that of the spacing between each hair. The head is rounded in outline, with a convex rear edge and no distinct rear corners, but instead has a slight expansion of the anterior section and no frontal ridges are present. The eyes are kidney shaped, slightly bulging, and large, placed far forward on the head. The ocelli are also large, but smaller then the distance between each of the three.

Archaeological Park of Dion

The Archaeological Park of Dion is the most important archaeological site at <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> in Greece, located in <a href="Dion%2C%20Pieria">Dion</a> (Greek: Δίον). In the area comprised by the Archaeological Park of Dion, sanctuaries were found from the <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic</a> and <a href="Roman%20Greece">Roman</a> periods.

Location.
Dion is located at the north-east foot of <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a>. It is five kilometers from the sea, 15 kilometers from <a href="Katerini">Katerini</a> and 17 kilometers from the ancient <a href="Leivithra">Leivithra</a>. In Hellenistic times the distance to the sea was only 1.5 kilometers. Dion is connected with the Thermaean Gulf by the once navigable river Baphyras. About 100 m east of the park entrance is the source of the Baphyras. Here was probably the sacred grove of the <a href="Muse">Muse</a>s.

Archaeological facilities.
The Archaeological Park.
The park has an area of 150 hectares, of which 50 hectares belong to the urban area and 50 hectares to the sanctuaries. Another 50 hectares have not yet been explored archaeologically. In the former urban area residential buildings, a market square, public buildings, churches, bathhouses, shops, workshops and toilets have been found. The sanctuaries, the theaters and the cemetery are located outside the city

The Archaeological Museum.
Half an kilometer west of the archaeological park, in the modern village of Dion, is the <a href="Archaeological%20Museum%20of%20Dion">archaeological museum</a>, built in 1983. Here the finds of ancient Dion and other archaeological places are exhibited. On the first floor there are also exhibits from <a href="Pydna">Pydna</a> and other archaeological sites of <a href="Pieria%20%28regional%20unit%29">Pieria</a>. In a small cinema, visitors will be audiovisual informed about Dion.

The Archaeotheke.
The building was erected directly behind the museum on the western side, specifically for the exhibition of the Dionysos mosaic. On the upper floor, a gallery is arranged around the mosaic so that the visitor can view it from all perspectives. In showcases recently found exhibits are displayed.

History.
424 v. <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> mentions Dion as the first city reached by the Spartan general Brasidas, coming from Thessaly (Tempi) in Macedonia.. <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> mentioned Dion as one of the places at Orpheus had lived.

In the Hellenistic period, Dion became the religious center of <a href="Macedonia%20%28Greece%29">Macedonia</a>. <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> was venerated here, and Olympic games were held in honor of Zeus and the Muses. The village of Dion gained a certain importance within Greece through the sanctuary and over time developed into a city. <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> sacrificed to Zeus in Dion before he began his campaign against the Persians. Later, he had 25 bronze statues of the cavaliers fallen in the Battle of the Cranicos, erected in the Zeus Olympios Shrine. In the year 219 BC, the city was destroyed by the Aitolians. Philipp V had the city rebuilt immediately. The Romans took the city 169 BC. Gradually, Roman settlers came to Dion and brought their officialdom, their units of measurement and weight units with them. In the course of the changing owners, more sanctuaries were built. After the middle of the 3rd century AD, the decline started by the raids of neighboring tribes, earthquakes and floods. In the fourth century AD, Dion (Dium) experienced a last flourishing when it became the official seat of a Bishop. The place is last mentioned as an administrative district of the Byzantine emperor Constantinos Porphyrogennetos in the 10th century.

Recent History.
In 1806 the ancient Dion was rediscovered by the English explorer <a href="William%20M.%20Leake">William M. Leake</a>. <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Heuzey">Léon Heuzey</a> confirmed the discovery in 1855. The rector of the University of Thessaloniki, Georgios Sotiriadis, began with the first excavations from 1928 to 1931. The work was resumed by Georgios Bakalakis 30 years later. From 1973, under the direction of Professor <a href="Dimitrios%20Pandermalis">Dimitrios Pandermalis</a>, larger areas of the city were excavated. The works are still continuing under the direction of the <a href="University%20of%20Thessaloniki">University of Thessaloniki</a>.

The Sanctuaries.
Demeter Sanctuary.
It consists of several temples and is dated from the archaic period up to the Roman Empire. In the open, but walled-in room, <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a> was offered liquid sacrifices. The oldest remains of the sanctuary are also found here. End of the fourth century BC two archaic temples were replaced by two Doric temples. Small (one-room) temples (Oikos) were consecrated to the gods of the earth such as <a href="Baubo">Baubo</a> and Kurotrophos. The worshippers were hoping for rich harvest yields. Another temple was erected in honor of <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>. The faithful hoped for increased fertility. Before the temples there were altars, on which to the respective gods were sacrificed. In the Late Antiquity there were kilns on the grounds of the Demeter Shrine.

Asclepios Sanctuary.
In the fourth century BC, The <a href="Asclepion">Asclepion</a> was built. A place was chosen with plenty of water, because it played a special role in the practice of the Asclepion cult. It served the healing of the sick and was needed for the cult practices. So far, the foundations of a building that consisted of two rooms were cleared. The discovery of a toilet near the sanctuary suggests that people (pilgrims) were there for some time to cure their ailments.

Zeus Olympios Sanctuary.
In the Hellenistic period a powerful temple was built on a sacred grove consecrated to Zeus. In this sanctuary were gilded statues of the Macedonian kings. The bronze statues of his cavaliers who had fallen in the Battle of the Cranikos were also found in the Zeus Olympian Shrine. The central square within the building was occupied by a 22 m long altar. The sacrificial animals were tied to metal rings. In the sacrificial ceremonies, the most important part of the Zeus cult, 100 cattle were sacrificed.

When the Aitoler Dion attacked, the sanctuary was destroyed. But it was rebuilt immediately by the materials of the surrounding buildings.

Zeus Hypsistos sanctuary.
A sacred road led to the sanctuary of Zeus Hypsistus (Greek Ζευς ὕψιστος "Zeus the Highest God"). It was lined with small columns with marble eagles sitting there. These are devotions for the Most Holy. The road led to a large square, on which stood a temple. It consisted of separate rooms. In the northernmost room, the Temple of Zeus, a statue of Zeus Hypsistus and the figure of a marble eagle were found. The floor was decorated with mosaic, which retained the image of two ravens. Also the floor of the overall building was mosaic. There remained a white bull and double axes. On the western side is a water basin. In front of the temple stands an altar, to the base of which a metal ring was attached, which served to tie the sacrificial animals.

Isis Sanctuary.
The most recent of the sanctuaries in Dion is the sanctuary of <a href="Isis">Isis</a>. It was erected in the second century AD on the site of a former fertility sanctuary. The plant has a considerable size and is traversed by a channel, which is to symbolize the river Nile. The main entrance is in the east, ie the side facing the sea. A minor entrance is found on the north side of the sanctuary. The temple and altar of Isis Lochia (Isis as the guardian of the child's bed) are framed in the western part of the complex by two smaller temples of Isis Tyche and the Aphrodite Hypolympiada. In these little temples springs are still active. In the cult of Isis, water was given sacred meaning. Two rooms, which are located in the north of the temple complex, served as a sanctuary for hypnotherapy, while figures of the patrons of the sanctuary were placed in the other room.

The Theaters.
Hellinistic Theater.
The classical theater, in which the premiere of Bakchen of <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> took place, was replaced in the 3rd century BC by the Hellenistic theater. A semi-circular mound of earth was laid on which brick-built seats were placed. A digging around the round orchestra ensures the drainage of the rainwater. Underground rooms and hallways allowed the appearance and disappearance of actors and objects. The stage was slightly higher than the orchestra. There were devices which allowed to show special effects. The theater is used today, after a further modernization, for the annual "<a href="Olympus%20Festival">Olympos Festiva</a>l".

Roman Theater.
The Roman Theater was built in the 2nd century AD. It had 24 seats arranged in a semicircle. Below the row of seats were 14 brick vaults. The orchestra had a diameter of about 21 meters. The building was built of bricks, field stones and mortar. The stage and the koilon (the auditorium, the seats) were separated; The stage was decorated with marble elements. Among the exhibits excavated there was a statue of <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>.

The Ancient City.
The City Walls.
The city wall was built between 306 and 304 BC from the limestone of Mount Olympus. It was 2625 meters long, 3 meters thick and 7 to 10 meters high. At a distance of 33 meters stood towers with an area of 7 by 7 meters. At the river Baphyras, to the east of the city, was probably a port facility. After the attack of the Aitolians (219 BC), in which the wall was partially destroyed, the protective barrier was repaired immediately. During Roman domination she received little attention. Sometimes even the masonry fell apart. When the attacks on Dion were piling up in the 3rd century AD, the city wall was repaired. Old sculptures and remains of other buildings were used as building materials. Floods by the Helikon and Baphyras rivers during the early Christian era considerably reduced the urban area of Dion. The city wall had only a length of 1600 meters. New walls were built on the north and east sides of the town. Column remains, sculptures and altars were used as building materials. In the 5th century AD the city wall was destroyed, probably by an earthquake.

The Houses.
In the course of the excavations, private houses were brought to light in various parts of the complex. Almost all have mosaic flooring. The names of the former owners occasionally come from preserved parts of a mosaic, or from stamping the lead pipes, which served the water supply. In addition to mosaics, statues, columns, remains of furniture, busts and others were found.

The Termal Baths.
All the <a href="thermal%20baths">thermal baths</a> have the same structure as they have a pool with cold water basins and other basins with differently tempered water. Also the type of heating, by a hypocaust-system lying under the floor, is the same for all mentioned thermal baths.

The great thermal baths were built in the 2nd century BC. A hall covered with a mosaic floor leads to the bathing cabins and the water basins. There were rooms where Asclepios was worshipped. Since the thermal baths also served as a place for social gatherings, an <a href="Odeon%20of%20Athens">Odeon</a> was built for social events such as readings, plays, or musical performances in the complex. The shops and toilets were still part of the thermal baths.

The so-called "thermal baths of the main street" are located east of the main street, opposite the wall with the stone armorings and shields. The equipment was comparable to the large thermal baths, the area was only a lot smaller.

The thermal baths on the market can be found at the north-east end of the Roman market. Mosaic flooring and a reception hall decorated with paintings are the special features of these thermal baths.

The Odeon.
History and Construction.
Built in the 2nd century AD, the Odeon is part of the large thermal baths. The outer mass is 28.46 m by 19.46 m, it offered 400 seats arranged in the form of an <a href="amphitheater">amphitheater</a> around the semicircular orchestra. The excavations of the Odeon began in September 1977 and lasted for two years. The elements of an ancient theater with orchestra, koilon, four interior staircases, stage and two L-shaped staircases were found. The carefully executed stonework work combines Roman architecture with local craftsmanship. The 1.55 m thick outer wall was a major static element; She caught the side pressure of the Koilon and supported the roof. The walls of the building were built of limestone or burnt bricks. The excavations revealed how the building was destroyed. The great cracks in the walls, as well as the lowering of the ground and some walls, indicate a strong earthquake with subsequent fire.

Restoration.
The natural stresses where the remains of the Odeon were exposed to, heat, frost and moisture, destroyed parts of the building material (mortar, wood) over the centuries. The binding effect of the mortar subsided and the remaining foundation walls fell apart. The top part of the construction suffered the most, large blocks of the building dissolved and fell. The aim of the restoration was the preservation and reinforcement of the remains of the Odeon. The old mortar was sealed and cracks in the masonry were closed with fresh mortar. The fallen parts of the masonry were moved to their original place and fixed. The final work consisted of building a straight bearing surface from surrounding stones and covering them with specially made bricks. The material of the bricks corresponds to that of the ancient bricks. In the University of Thessaloniki the ancient bricks were examined and their composition determined. The composition of the mortar was determined according to laboratory tests and established in collaboration with the Management Committee for the Conservation of Ancient and Modern Monuments of the Ministry of Culture and Sport. The original construction was covered with lead before restoration. Thus, the old building fabric is severely separated from the new building materials. The floor of the Odeon was covered with pebbles and the architectural elements found on the site, such as columns, were erected in their original place.

The financing for the protection, conservation and restoration of the Odeon was taken from the EU program "Macedonia-Thrace 2007-2013". The works were based on the studies of Professor G. Karadedos, University of Thessaloniki.

The Water Supply.
From the foot of Mount Olympus water pipes were laid to Dion. Partially they went underground, partly they were built as an <a href="Aqueduct%20%28water%20supply%29">aqueduct</a>. Within the city, the water collected in a large cistern, from which the distribution in subterranean pipes to other cisterns or water towers took place. Both clay and lead were used as the material for the water pipes.

The Roman Market.
It is an open space surrounded by shops and halls. On the side facing the mountains, in the middle of the building surrounding the market, there was a temple (<a href="Sebasteion">Sebasteion</a>) presumably consecrated to the Roman emperors. The floor is slightly above the level of the market square and is decorated with mosaic. Inside, there were remains of murals and fragments of male statues. To the east of the square, opposite the temple, stood a Roman basilica. It was decorated with the frieze of armour and shields, which is now to the west of the main road. Under the supervision of the local authority, banking operations were conducted and commercial contracts were concluded in the basilica.

Churches.
The Basilica of the Bishop.
At its last heyday, when the church appointed Dion to the seat of a Bishop, the basilica of the bishop was built in two phases of construction in the 4th and 5th centuries. It was a three-nave church with <a href="Narthex">Narthex</a>. The remains of the walls are painted, the floor was mosaic. A smaller building, situated to the west of the church, served as a <a href="Baptistery">Baptistery</a>. An earthquake at the end of the fourth century destroyed the building. On its foundations a church was erected, in which the Baptistery was integrated. The baptismal font had the shape of a Maltese cross.

The Cemetery Church.
In the middle of the cemetery, a three-nave church was built at the beginning of the 5th century. The center ship had a mosaic floor; Narthex and side ships were covered with clay tiles. Under the floor of the church, graves were discovered. Later on, a grain store were added to the building and a vault and where the church treasury was kept.

Lê Nghi Dân

Thiên Hưng Đế (Jun 1439 - 6 Jun 1460), born Lê Nghi Dân (黎宜民), was the fourth emperor of <a href="L%C3%AA%20dynasty">Lê dynasty</a> in <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. He ruled the country for a short time, about eight months until be deposed by a group of court officials. As he was deposed in a coup, later he was not given any temple name.

Biography.
He was the eldest son of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%C3%A1i%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Thái Tông</a> and Consort <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20Th%E1%BB%8B%20B%C3%AD">Dương Thị Bí</a>. He became Crown Prince in 1440, however, was deposed in 1441 and replaced by his half-brother, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Nh%C3%A2n%20T%C3%B4ng">Prince Lê Bang Cơ</a>. He was given title of Prince <a href="L%E1%BA%A1ng%20S%C6%A1n">Lạng Sơn</a> (Lạng Sơn vương, 諒山王).
Diên Ninh coup.
On 3 October 1459, Lê Nghi Dân launched a coup that resulted in the dethroning of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Nh%C3%A2n%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Nhân Tông</a>, and then succeeded him to the throne. 
Reign.
He put the Era name as "Thiên Hưng" (天興). The young king was very ambitious, and tried to reform the government.
He changed the administrative system to "six ministries, six departments" which was considered as a brilliant policy and this system still be followed by his successors. For the foreign affairs, he requested the Ming Dynasty not to pay pearls as tribute. He also promoted his brothers, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%C3%A1nh%20T%C3%B4ng">Prince Lê Tư Thành</a> to Prince Gia ("Gia vương", 嘉王), <a href="L%C3%AA%20Kh%E1%BA%AFc%20X%C6%B0%C6%A1ng">Prince Lê Khắc Xương</a> to Prince Cung ("Cung vương", 恭王) and gave them new palaces as new properties .

However, he was largely unsupported by many Royal court officials because he killed his brother, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Nh%C3%A2n%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Nhân Tông</a> as a "inhuman" action. During his short-time reign, he had to face many conflicts and coups from the old officials, who followed his grandfather and father since Dynasty foundation period. The Vietnamese historians reported the series of coups during Thiên Hưng's era as <a href="Thi%C3%AAn%20H%C6%B0ng%20coup">Thiên Hưng coup</a>.

In May 1460, some officials, notably <a href="%C4%90%E1%BB%97%20B%C3%AD">Đỗ Bí</a>, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Ngang">Lê Ngang</a>, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%E1%BB%A5">Lê Thụ</a> secretly discussed about a coup against Lê Nghi Dân, but the discussion was leaked out and all of them were exterminated.

After this affair, Thiên Hưng Đế became more suspicious and he started installed his inner supporters into the Royal court's important official positions. It made him even more unpopular among court officials, and they finally began plotting against him.

In 6 Jun 1460, a group of officials, notably <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20X%C3%AD">Nguyễn Xí</a>, <a href="%C4%90inh%20Li%E1%BB%87t">Đinh Liệt</a>, <a href="L%C3%AA%20L%C4%83ng">Lê Lăng</a>, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Ni%E1%BB%87m">Lê Niệm</a>,<a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c%20Trung">Nguyễn Đức Trung</a>, launched another coup and successfully deposed Thiên Hưng Đế. He was demoted to Marquis of Lệ Đức ("Lệ Đức hầu", 厲德侯), and does not have any royal mausoleum like the other Vietnamese rulers.
Some unofficial reports stated that the coup leaders drove him to suicide, and Thiên Hưng Đế died in 1460, at the age of 21. However, also some others stated that he and her mother were just sent to exiled to <a href="L%E1%BA%A1ng%20S%C6%A1n">Lạng Sơn</a> and he lived there until his death in 1460. 

After the coup, the coup leaders wanted to put the second prince of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%C3%A1i%20T%C3%B4ng">Emperor Lê Thái Tông</a>, <a href="L%C3%AA%20Kh%E1%BA%AFc%20X%C6%B0%C6%A1ng">Prince Lê Khắc Xương</a> to the throne, but received his refusal. Therefore, they decided to place <a href="L%C3%AA%20Th%C3%A1nh%20T%C3%B4ng">Prince Lê Tư Thành</a> as the fifth Emperor of <a href="L%C3%AA%20dynasty">Lê dynasty</a>.

Sawyers Valley Tavern

The Sawyers Valley Tavern was established in 1882 in <a href="Sawyers%20Valley%2C%20Western%20Australia">Sawyers Valley</a>, a hills suburb of <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. It was originally called the "Sawyers Valley Hotel" before acquiring its current name.

Lot Leather.
Lot Leather arrived on the <a href="Convict%20era%20of%20Western%20Australia">convict</a> ship “Clyde” in 1863 after killing his sweetheart’s lover. Leather began pit sawing at Sawyers Valley soon after and in 1874 he purchased the land on which the "Sawyers Valley Tavern" is built. In the mid 1880's he built a store, next to his homestead on <a href="York%20Road%2C%20Western%20Australia">York Road</a>, to serve the <a href="Eastern%20Railway%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Eastern Railway</a> construction workforce and the local sawyers.

History.
In 1882 Leather successfully applied for a colonial wine and beer licence and the store was replaced with the "Sawyers Valley Hotel". Even after the railway was finished, the Hotel attracted locals from nearby sawmills.
The Hotel and the recreation ground adjacent served as a local meeting place for mill workers, travelers, road boards, progress associations, historical societies and political rallies.
It also quickly became the gathering place for numerous sporting clubs, rifle clubs, <a href="Cricket%20in%20Western%20Australia">cricket</a> teams, cycling and motorcycle clubs. Sports meetings were promoted by subsequent publicans, including JH Kendall who was licensee for 21 years. Unsurprisingly, given the area’s history of timber milling, it was the focus of annual competitions in wood chopping, timber sawing, and tug-of war, with teams from nearby mills and hotels in <a href="Oxford%20Inn">Chidlow</a> and <a href="Mount%20Helena%20Hotel">Mount Helena</a>. 
In 1937 the old timber hotel was demolished and the new single storey brick hotel, designed by <a href="William%20G.%20Bennett">William Bennett</a>, erected on the same site featuring saloon and public bars, lounges, a dining room and ten bedrooms, kitchens and bathrooms.
During the Second World War the hotel featured in the <a href="List%20of%20newspapers%20in%20Western%20Australia">local newspapers</a> for incidents involving American servicemen. American soldiers and sailors were arrested for being drunk and fighting, and their girlfriends arrested for living ‘idle and disorderly lives’ and prostitution.
Over time licensees of the hotel have included Thomas Stone, Walter Pearce, William Riley, Fred Jacoby, Mary Kelly, and Clare Firth.

Architectural Character.
The single storey, "Sawyers Valley Tavern" is one of a few <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> style buildings in the shire other than some minor elements on several residence. The overall character of the building retains much of its original form and is simply detailed. The principle focus of Art Deco decoration is the projection through the tiled roof at the main entry of a tall, stepped, rounded and streamline rendered parapet element.

Heritage value.
The Sawyers Valley Tavern has high social significance for the local community. The building's Art Deco character is unique in the Shire. Sitting opposite the <a href="Railway%20Reserves%20Heritage%20Trail">Railway Reserve Heritage Trail</a>, the site also has historic significance as the location of Lot Leather's former store and hotel.

In 2016 the Sawyers Valley Tavern was listed on <a href="Heritage%20Council%20of%20Western%20Australia">Western Australia’s Heritage Register</a> for the contribution made by the place to Western Australia’s cultural heritage.

West Bromwich Albion F.C. Reserves and Academy

West Bromwich Albion Reserves and Academy are the youth teams of <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. The reserve team is made up of under-23 players, and is effectively West Bromwich Albion's second-string side. The under-18 players among other younger age groups make up the academy team. They play in the <a href="Professional%20Development%20League">Premier League 2 Division 2</a>, the second tier of reserve team football in England.

History.
In the 1882–83 season, Albion fielded a reserve side for the first time; the club's second team played 24 matches and went through the season undefeated. Due to the club's financial situation, the reserves had their wages halved early in the 1885–86 season, and by January 1886 the payments made to reserve players were withdrawn altogether. This resulted in Albion's second team refusing to play against Small Heath Alliance and the game was cancelled. Some of the players were suspended as a result of their actions, but were later re-instated. The Albion reserves first competed in <a href="The%20Central%20League">The Central League</a> in 1921 and won the competition seven times.

Albion's Youth team first entered the <a href="FA%20Youth%20Cup">FA Youth Cup</a> in 1952–53. In their first game in the competition, they defeated <a href="Brush%20Sports%20F.C.">Brush Sports</a> by a 10–1 scoreline. They reached the final in 1954–55 and 1968–69, losing to Manchester United and Sunderland respectively. Albion won the competition for the only time in their history in 1975–76, beating local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers 5–0 on aggregate in the two-legged final.

The line passes through many small towns and villages with <a href="grain%20elevators">grain elevators</a> along its route, and it is the origin of numerous grain <a href="unit%20trains">unit trains</a>. 

The line began as the St. Paul and Sioux City railroad and was constructed between 1871 and 1872. It then became a division of the <a href="Chicago%2C%20St.%20Paul%2C%20Minneapolis%20and%20Omaha%20Railway">Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway</a> (Omaha Road), which in turn became part of the <a href="Chicago%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">Chicago and North Western Railway</a> in 1882.

Accidents.
On November 18, 1999, an empty northbound Union Pacific grain unit train was stopped on the main track at Carnes to meet a southbound UP manifest train which was to take the siding. For reasons unknown, the southbound train did not enter the siding and struck the stopped northbound train head-on, derailing 30 cars, five locomotives, and claiming the life of 23-year-old conductor Paul Schmidt of <a href="Boone%2C%20Iowa">Boone, Iowa</a> on the southbound train. Dale Evans, the driver of a crew transport van parked nearby was also killed.

Brunnenbach (Lochbach)

In earlier centuries, from at least 1412, the Brunnenbach supplied the city of <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> with <a href="drinking%20water">drinking water</a>. It originates in several <a href="spring%20%28river%29">springs</a> in the <a href="Lech%20river">Lech river</a> meadows south of the city. In the post-glacial period, great groundwater streams pushed the alluvial gravels of the <a href="Lechfeld">Lechfeld</a> northwards, feeding springs in many places from which streams flowed northwards. These headstreams were traditionally called "Gießer" by the locals.

One stream formed from the waters of several of these springs, whose water was clean enough for supplying the growing city, was called the Brunnenbach ("Spring Stream"). The stream was diverted into the city and fed many public wells and private water systems in Augsburg via a <a href="water%20works">water works</a> and <a href="water%20tower">water tower</a>s.

Today, drinking water is no longer extracted from the Brunnenbach. It flows, as before, through the Augsburg Municipal Forest, but now empties into the Lech Canal in front of the Red Gate ("Roter Tor"). This then crosses the <a href="Lechviertel">Lechviertel</a> and merges with the other Lech canals in the north of the city, before discharging into the Lech.

Margaret More (1903-1966)

Margaret More (1903-1966) - Welsh Composer

Biography.
Margaret More was born in Harlech, North Wales and lived there almost continuously, at Crown Lodge, till 1930 when she married Raymond Bantock, second son of the composer Granville Bantock. Thereafter she spent most of her life in the Midlands at Barnt Green, near Birmingham, where she raised her family. Contact with Harlech was maintained through summer holidays spent at Traethdy in the dunes. Later she restored a stone cottage, Hen Gaerffynnon,  to the south of Harlech where she was able to compose in solitude. 

More’s interest in music showed early, but she was not an infant prodigy. It became clear that her main concern was composition; she had no interest whatever in a career as a performer.  She was educated at home by a governess, who gave her a grounding in musical theory and encouraged her ambition. 

In her early teen-years More was befriended by the composer Joseph Holbrooke who at that time was living in Harlech. Her introduced her to the work of Debussy and gave her the recently published Preludes and Children’s Corner. These had a  lasting effect on More’s own work. 

In the mid-1920s Margaret More lived in London for a year. She attended Trinity College of Music where she studied composition with Edward d’Evry. It was during this year that she met the poet Claudine Currey who was the mother-in-law of her brother Jack. 

Claudine Currey had recently written an extended narrative poem, The Little Mermaid (pub. Elkin Mathews 1925) based on the 1837 story by Hans Andersen The Sea Maid, and this became the starting point for More’s first major work, a grand opera: The Mermaid. More was called back to Harlech in 1926 to care for a her mother who died the following year. She collaborated with the librettist for several years and the opera was finished, unorchestrated and unperformed, in 1929. There were, however, many evenings at Crown Lodge, where parts of the work were  played to invited audiences of friends, with More at the keyboard.  The opera was finally orchestrated in 1950 and performed in its entirety in 1951 by the Barfield Grand Opera Society in Birmingham, as part of the City’s contribution to the Festival of Britain. 

During the 1930s and early 1940s Margaret More raised a family of six children. Music took second place but she composed Matris Carmina, a suite of six works for piano and recorder, each piece dedicated to a particular child. During the war the family returned to Harlech for three years, living at Traethdy. The composer ran a school in the village and wrote music for school concerts and a Christmas performance n the Memorial Hall. 

In the mid-1940s More returned full strength to music. Her sister-in-law, Myrrha Hawkes, at that time living in South Africa, invited her to compose music for a children’s Christmas entertainment based on Hans Andersen’s story: The Snow Queen. The story was dramatized and the lyrics written by Michael Martin-Harvey, the son of the actor Sir John.

Martin-Harvey had been an old friend of Raymond Bantock’s, dating from Oxford in the 1920s.  This new work was performed during several Christmas seasons in Johannesburg in the late 1940s. 

In 1955 the Sarabande from  this work was awarded first and second prize in the Cheltenham Festival, and in that year More and Martin-Harvey founded the Hans Andersen Players. 

The idea behind this new departure was based on an early engraving of Andersen reading one of his stories at a table, with listeners sitting round in semi-circle. The image was re-interpreted with Martin-Harvey dressed as Andersen as narrator, with singers, in costume, seated on either side. Martin-Harvey wrote the lyrics and freely adapted the stories for this new art form. Margaret More composed the music for piano, which she played on stage.  

The first work to be performed by the Players was a re-casting of The Snow Queen, with its debut in Birmingham, in 1955. Other stories that were adapted over the next few years were The Nightingale, The Swineherd, Old Lukoie, It’s Quite True, Punchinello, and Five out of One Pod.  The Players performed widely in the Midlands at a range of venues: Birmingham Repertory Theatre, The Midland Institute, Birmingham Theatre School, School halls and theatres, and in Berkshire where Martin-Harvey lived, at Village Halls. In 1957 the Players were invited to tour Denmark through the aegis of the Danish Consulate in Birmingham. The tour involved several weeks and most of the larger towns in the country, which much of the time spent in Aarhus. 

Margaret More’s last major work, The Mouse, was a setting from one of one of the stories from the Welsh folk lore The Mabinogion. The libretto was by Amabel Williams-Ellis of Port Meirion and the work was first performed by the Players in Coleg Harlech and Port Meirion in 1958. The composer later re-cast the music as a dramatic lay, as 70 minutes of continuous song, without narration. 

Margaret More died in 1966. The Players continued their work for a few years performing in Nottingham and Bristol. The Mouse was performed posthumously several times at the family home in Barnt Green, produced by her fifth son Gavin and costumed by her third son Cuillin. 

More’s main forte as a composer was work for voice. She composed away from the piano, and as with many song writers, wrote with a particular singer’s voice in mind.  A late work, Anthem, is for unaccompanied voice and is a memorial to her fourth son who died in 1957.

The Rockingham Mausoleum

The Rockingham Mausoleum, <a href="Wentworth%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Wentworth</a>, near <a href="Rotherham">Rotherham</a>, <a href="South%20Yorkshire">South Yorkshire</a>, <a href="England">England</a> was commissioned in 1783 by <a href="William%20Fitzwilliam%2C%204th%20Earl%20Fitzwilliam">William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam</a> when he inherited the estates of his uncle <a href="Charles%20Watson-Wentworth%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Rockingham">Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham</a> who died without a direct male heir in 1782. The architect was <a href="John%20Carr%20%28architect%29">John Carr</a> of <a href="York">York</a>, who had already built the stable block at <a href="Wentworth%20Woodhouse">Wentworth Woodhouse</a> for Lord Rockingham himself. Carr was to do a great deal of work for Lord Fitzwilliam, notably alterations to the side pavilions and to the west elevation of Wentworth Woodhouse. He submitted a number of options for the monument, some of which were based on the concept of an <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>. The three-storey design ultimately selected may have been inspired by the <a href="Glanum%23Mausoleum_of_the_Julii">Mausoleum of the Julii</a> at St Remy de Provence, <a href="Glanum">Glanum</a> near <a href="Arles">Arles</a>, <a href="France">France</a>. As executed, it is a combination of a <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> and a Temple of Friendship, housing within it a statue by <a href="Joseph%20Nollekens">Joseph Nollekens</a> of Rockingham himself in Garter robes with upraised hand. The name by which the memorial is now known is in fact a misnomer, since Charles Watson-Wentworth is buried in <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a>. Eighteenth and nineteenth century sources refer to the edifice simply as "the Monument". 

History.
The mausoleum was constructed by <a href="William%20Fitzwilliam%2C%204th%20Earl%20Fitzwilliam">William Wentworth Fitzwilliam</a> in memory of his uncle, <a href="Charles%20Watson-Wentworth%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Rockingham">Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham</a>, and Prime Minister at the time of his death in 1782. Building started in 1785 and took four years to complete. accounts record regular small payments to local artisans and more infrequent but larger disbursements to better-known craftsmen such as Nollekens. The building was enclosed by a fence of 743 iron railings commissioned from the Rotherham iron-founders Samuel Walker and Company. Finally, in 1792 four obelisks, which had previously stood on the West side of the Woodhouse, were relocated to the Monument and placed inside the enclosure.

The monument is the property of the Fitzwilliam Wentworth Amenity Trust, which completed its restoration in the 1980's with the aid of compensation from British Coal and a grant from English Heritage. It only became possible to undertake this work when all undermining was at an end, making it safe to remove iron clamps which had kept the building stable while mining was in progress. The monument was opened to the public for the first time in 1991.

The Fitzwilliam Wentworth Amenity Trust is a charitable trust formed in 1979 with an endowment from the <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth-Fitzwilliam%2C%2010th%20Earl%20Fitzwilliam">Thomas Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 10th Earl Fitzwilliam</a>. The principal aim of the Trust is to promote the permanent conservation of lands and building of beauty or historic interest and generally to protect, preserve and improve the rural and visual character and amenities of the Parish of Wentworth and the adjacent areas. The Trust continues to invest in the conservation and restoration of the landscape and buildings in and around Wentworth.

Architecture and description.
The mausoleum is built of <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>. It is a three-stage monument, with obelisks at the four corners. Niches in the walls support busts of eight of the Marquis's closest friends, all luminaries of the <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> hierarchy; <a href="Augustus%20Keppel%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Keppel">Admiral Viscount Keppel</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>, <a href="Sir%20George%20Savile%2C%208th%20Baronet">Sir George Savile</a>, <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a>, <a href="The%20Duke%20of%20Portland">The Duke of Portland</a>, <a href="John%20Lee%20%28Attorney-General%29">John Lee</a>, <a href="Lord%20John%20Cavendish">Lord John Cavendish</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Montagu">Frederick Montagu</a>.

Of these, four are listed at Grade II*, the middle grade, and the others are at Grade II, the lowest grade. 

Until the coming of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, Oldham was a small settlement in an agricultural region. By the early 19th century, it had become an important centre for handloom weaving. The cotton spinning industry grew, initially though small firms, and later by large mills. By the late 19th century "Oldham was the leading mill town in the world". In the town were the factories of <a href="Platt%20Brothers">Platt Brothers</a>, who were the largest manufacturers of cotton processing machines in the world. Many of the cotton mills were designed by members of the firm of <a href="Stott%20and%20Sons">Stott and Sons</a>. Since the decline of the cotton industry, many mills have been demolished, and others have been converted for other uses.

The listed buildings reflect this history, the oldest ones being houses, farmhouses and farm buildings. Then came houses with facilities for domestic weaving, with workshop windows in the upper storeys, and later the large cotton mills. As the wealth of the town grew, so did the buildings, including churches, civic buildings and commercial buildings. Local philanthropists contributed to some of the buildings, and they are commemorated in memorials.

<doc id="54782330" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54782330" title="Continuous-variable quantum information">
Continuous-variable quantum information

Continuous-variable quantum information is the area of <a href="quantum%20information%20science">quantum information science</a> that makes use of <a href="Observable">physical observables</a>, like the strength of an <a href="electromagnetic%20field">electromagnetic field</a>, whose numerical values belong to <a href="List%20of%20continuity-related%20mathematical%20topics">continuous</a> <a href="Interval%20%28mathematics%29">intervals</a>. One primary application is <a href="quantum%20computing">quantum computing</a>. In a sense, continuous-variable quantum computation is "analogue", while quantum computation using <a href="Qubit">qubits</a> is "digital." In more technical terms, the former makes use of <a href="Hilbert%20space">Hilbert spaces</a> that are <a href="Dimension">infinite-dimensional</a>, while the Hilbert spaces for systems comprising collections of qubits are finite-dimensional. One motivation for studying continuous-variable quantum computation is to understand what resources are necessary to make quantum computers more powerful than classical ones.

Implementation.
One approach to implementing continuous-variable quantum information protocols in the laboratory is through the techniques of <a href="quantum%20optics">quantum optics</a>. By modeling each mode of the electromagnetic field as a <a href="quantum%20harmonic%20oscillator">quantum harmonic oscillator</a> with its associated creation and annihilation operators, one defines a <a href="Conjugate%20variables">canonically conjugate</a> pair of variables for each mode, the so-called "quadratures", which play the role of <a href="Position%20and%20momentum%20space">position and momentum</a> observables. These observables establish a <a href="phase%20space">phase space</a> on which <a href="Wigner%20quasiprobability%20distribution">Wigner quasiprobability distributions</a> can be defined. <a href="Measurement%20in%20quantum%20mechanics">Quantum measurements</a> on such a system can be performed using <a href="Homodyne%20detection">homodyne</a> and <a href="Heterodyne%20detection">heterodyne detectors</a>.

<a href="Quantum%20teleportation">Quantum teleportation</a> of continuous-variable quantum information was achieved by optical methods in 1998. (<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">"Science"</a> deemed this experiment one of the "top 10" advances of the year.) In 2013, quantum-optics techniques were used to create a "<a href="cluster%20state">cluster state</a>", a type of preparation of great interest to quantum computation, involving over 10,000 <a href="Quantum%20entanglement">entangled</a> modes.

Another proposal is to modify the <a href="Trapped%20ion%20quantum%20computer">ion-trap quantum computer</a>: instead of storing a single <a href="qubit">qubit</a> in the internal energy levels of an ion, one could in principle use the position and momentum of the ion as continuous quantum variables.

Applications.
Continuous-variable quantum systems can be used for <a href="quantum%20cryptography">quantum cryptography</a>, and in particular, <a href="quantum%20key%20distribution">quantum key distribution</a>. <a href="Quantum%20computing">Quantum computing</a> is another potential application, and a variety of approaches have been considered. The first method, proposed by <a href="Seth%20Lloyd">Seth Lloyd</a> and <a href="Samuel%20L.%20Braunstein">Samuel L. Braunstein</a> in 1999, was in the tradition of the <a href="Quantum%20circuit">circuit model</a>: quantum <a href="Logic%20gate">logic gates</a> are created by <a href="Hamiltonian%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">Hamiltonians</a> that, in this case, are quadratic functions of the harmonic-oscillator quadratures. Later, <a href="One-way%20quantum%20computer">measurement-based quantum computation</a> was adapted to the setting of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Yet a third model of continuous-variable quantum computation encodes finite-dimensional systems (collections of <a href="Qubit">qubits</a>) into infinite-dimensional ones. This model is due to <a href="Daniel%20Gottesman">Daniel Gottesman</a>, <a href="Alexei%20Kitaev">Alexei Kitaev</a> and <a href="John%20Preskill">John Preskill</a>.

Classical emulation.
In all approaches to quantum computing, it is important to know whether a task under consideration can be carried out efficiently by a classical computer. An <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> might be described in the language of quantum mechanics, but upon closer analysis, revealed to be implementable using only classical resources. Such an algorithm would not be taking full advantage of the extra possibilities made available by quantum physics. In the theory of quantum computation using finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, the <a href="Gottesman%E2%80%93Knill%20theorem">Gottesman–Knill theorem</a> demonstrates that there exists a set of quantum processes that can be emulated efficiently on a classical computer. Generalizing this theorem to the continuous-variable case, it can be shown that, likewise, a class of continuous-variable quantum computations can be simulated using only classical analogue computations. This class includes, in fact, some computational tasks that use <a href="quantum%20entanglement">quantum entanglement</a>. When the <a href="Wigner%20quasiprobability%20distribution">Wigner quasiprobability representations</a> of all the quantities—states, time evolutions "and" measurements—involved in a computation are nonnegative, then they can be interpreted as ordinary probability distributions, indicating that the computation can be modeled as an essentially classical one. This type of construction can be thought of as a continuum generalization of the <a href="Spekkens%20Toy%20Model">Spekkens Toy Model</a>.

Computing continuous functions with discrete quantum systems.
Occasionally, and somewhat confusingly, the term "continuous quantum computation" is used to refer to a different area of quantum computing: the study of how to use quantum systems having "finite"-dimensional Hilbert spaces to calculate or approximate the answers to mathematical questions involving <a href="continuous%20function">continuous function</a>s. A major motivation for investigating the quantum computation of continuous functions is that many scientific problems have mathematical formulations in terms of continuous quantities. A second motivation is to explore and understand the ways in which quantum computers can be more capable or powerful than classical ones. The <a href="Computational%20complexity%20theory">computational complexity</a> of a problem can be quantified in terms of the minimal computational resources necessary to solve it. In quantum computing, resources include the number of <a href="qubit">qubit</a>s available to a computer and the number of <a href="Quantum%20complexity%20theory">queries</a> that can be made to that computer. The classical complexity of many continuous problems is known. Therefore, when the quantum complexity of these problems is obtained, the question as to whether quantum computers are more powerful than classical can be answered. Furthermore, the degree of the improvement can be quantified. In contrast, the complexity of discrete problems is typically unknown. For example, the classical complexity of <a href="integer%20factorization">integer factorization</a> is unknown.

One example of a scientific problem that is naturally expressed in continuous terms is <a href="path%20integration">path integration</a>. The general technique of path integration has numerous applications including <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, <a href="quantum%20chemistry">quantum chemistry</a>, <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>, and <a href="computational%20finance">computational finance</a>. Because randomness is present throughout quantum theory, one typically requires that a quantum computational procedure yield the correct answer, not with certainty, but with high probability. For example, one might aim for a procedure that computes the correct answer with probability at least 3/4. One also specifies a degree of uncertainty, typically by setting the maximum acceptable error. Thus, the goal of a quantum computation could be to compute the numerical result of a path-integration problem to within an error of at most ε with probability 3/4 or more. In this context, it is known that quantum algorithms can outperform their classical counterparts, and the computational complexity of path integration, as measured by the number of times one would expect to have to query a quantum computer to get a good answer, grows as the inverse of ε.

Other continuous problems for which quantum algorithms have been studied include finding matrix <a href="Eigenvalues%20and%20eigenvectors">eigenvalues</a>, phase estimation, the Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem, solving <a href="Differential%20equation">differential equations</a> with the <a href="Feynman%E2%80%93Kac%20formula">Feynman–Kac formula</a>, initial value problems, function approximation and high-dimensional integration.

A <a href="Moscow%20University">Moscow University</a> alumnus, Feoktistov started out as an essayist and journalist. Contributing to "<a href="Moskovskiye%20Vedomosti">Moskovskiye Vedomosti</a>", "<a href="Russky%20Vestnik">Russky Vestnik</a>", "<a href="Sovremennik">Sovremennik</a>", and "<a href="Otechestvennye%20Zapiski">Otechestvennye Zapiski</a>", he published numerous articles on Russian history and current politics. Three of his major works came out as separate editions, "Greece's Fight for Independence" (1863), "Magnitsky. The Materials for the History of Education in Russia" (1865), and "Russia and Prussia's Relations in the Reign of Elizaveta Petrovna" (1882). He also edited "<a href="Russkaya%20Rech">Russkaya Rech</a>" and the "Journal of the Ministry of Education".

Having started out as a liberal, Feoktisov later turned conservative and monarchist. In 1883-1896 he served as the head of the Interior Ministry's Press department (Russia's 'censor-in-chief'), his very name becoming the symbol of the severity of <a href="Alexander%20III">Alexander III</a>'s censorship.

Ladies of the Lights

Ladies of the Lights: Michigan Women in the U.S. Lighthouse Service is a non-fiction book by Patricia Majher that provides historical details of the women who served as Michigan's lighthouse keepers for 105 years.

Overview.
As the new assistant director/curator at the <a href="Michigan%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame</a> in 2007, Patricia Majher built a traveling exhibit based on the 2003 article “Mystery at Sand Point Lighthouse” written by historian Kathy Mason. The enthusiasm generated in Michigan by the exhibit prompted Majher to compile her research findings into a book, released by the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Press">University of Michigan Press</a> in 2010. There is a background chapter on the first recorded women lighthouse keepers, Irish nuns of the St. Anne’s convent in <a href="County%20Cork">County Cork</a> who maintained the <a href="List%20of%20lighthouses%20in%20Ireland">Youghal lighthouse</a> during the years 1190–1542, and the first American woman lighthouse keeper in 1775 at <a href="Boston%20Harbor">Boston Harbor</a> when Hannah Thomas assumed her husband's lighthouse keeper duties as he went to war. The book covers the lives and light keeper duties of individual Michigan women who served in their positions for the years 1849-1954. Included in the book are salary, duties, and hardships that came with the post, both to the women who officially held the positions, as well as women who unofficially served in that capacity when their lightkeeper husbands were unable to. The author provides insight into family life for lighthouse keepers.


Reception.
Cathy Green for the "Michigan Historical Review" said the book, "chips away at the romanticized vision of life as a 
light keeper, while preserving not only the job’s prosaic character but also the exceptional nature of this career." Green credited the book for its a wide audience appeal beyond lighthouse aficionados, and noted the author's meticulous historical research in presenting the subject.

"Yak's Corner", a children's online news magazine of "<a href="Detroit%20Free%20Press">Detroit Free Press</a>" and "<a href="Detroit%20news">Detroit news</a>", featured the book for its 2011 <a href="Women%27s%20History%20Month">Women's History Month</a> coverage. Mlive, the online arm of <a href="Booth%20Newspapers">Booth Newspapers</a>, also featured the book as part of its coverage of Michigan's 2011 <a href="Coast%20Guard%20Festival">Coast Guard Festival</a>. After the book's publication, Majher was a featured speaker for the Bay County Historical Society 's series on lighthouses.

Allochares azureus

Allochares azureus is a species of <a href="spider%20wasp">spider wasp</a> from the family <a href="Pompilidae">Pompilidae</a>, it is the only member of the <a href="monotypy">monotypic</a> <a href="genus">genus</a> "Allochares". It occurs in the southern part of North America and is a specialist <a href="parasitoid">parasitoid</a> of the Southern house spider.

Description.
"Allochares azureus" is a distinctive species of spider wasp, especially in the shape of the head which is convex in the fromt and concave in its rear, this is especially marked in the males. It also has a characteristic excavated <a href="propodeum">propodeum</a> which has conical teeth pointing towards the wasp's posterior. The females lack a tarsal comb. The body of the wasp is black but the short hairs cause it to have blue or green <a href="iridescence">iridescence</a>. The females measure 9-13.5mm on length and the males 7-10mm.

Distribution.
"Allochares azureus" is found only in the southern part of the <a href="Nearctic">Nearctic</a> <a href="ecozone">ecozone</a> in the most southern parts of the <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">United States</a> from <a href="Florida">Florida</a> to <a href="California">California</a> south to the Mexivan states of <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a> and <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>.

Biology.
"Allochares azureus" has an distinctive biology among spider wasps. Following mating the female hunts for a <a href="southern%20house%20spider">southern house spider</a> ("Kukulcania hibernalis"), searching for prey on foot with short rapid rushes and flicking of wings, it will make short flights of a metre or so between hunting sites. Once a spider is found the wasp move to the centre of the web where the spider has a tube like retreat which the wasp enters. The spider reacts to the wasp by retreating away from its web and finding a chiding place in a fissure or another spider's webs where it hides and tries to remain motionless, the wasp seems unable to detect the spider so long as it is still. The wasp continues to search and if it touches the spider the spider will try to retreat and the wasp will pursue it. The lack of spines and modified tarsal claws shown by "A. azureus" appears to be an adaptation to this as their presence could probably cause the wasp to get tangled in the <a href="velcro">velcro</a> like threads of the spider's web. The female attacks the spider from behind, sometimes flipping it on its back and paralyses the spider with a sting in the <a href="venter">venter</a> . The paralysed spider is the dragged, sometimes vertically, back to its web or to another unoccupied web and is secured in the web by the female using the spider's own silk strands to wrap it in and lays an egg on it. The egg hatches in 2-3 days, the larva the feeds on the spider for 10-12 days before it pupates in the web, building a distinct cocoon which has its outer surface covered in long silky hairs. This species has a number of generations in a year. The adults have been observed or caught feeding on flowers of "<a href="Baccharis">Baccharis</a>" and "<a href="Solidago">Solidago</a>", and also "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>", "<a href="Asclepias">Asclepias</a>", "<a href="Condalia">Condalia</a>", "<a href="Hyptis%20emoryi">Hyptis emoryi</a>" and "<a href="Colubrina%20texensis">Colubrina texensis</a>".

<doc id="54783173" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54783173" title="Carl Gibeily">
Carl Gibeily

Carl Gibeily (IPA /ka:l ʤɪbeɪli/), born in 1966 in <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, is a former Lebanese journalist for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Star%20%28Lebanon%29">The Daily Star</a>" and <a href="http%3A//www.thegulfonline.com/">"The Gulf Online"</a> and an author. The articles of Gibeily proved adamant in rendering his readership to question the relationship between the East and the West; for example, his article 'A global duality', intimates the fearful animosity held by the West towards the East, fearing 'weapons of mass destruction' and an end to Western democracy. Gibeily has composed three fictional novels, scilicet, "Pairing the Twain" published in 1992 by The Book Guild; "Blueprint for a Prophet", published in 1997 by Doubleday; and "Greater than a Wall", formerly known as "March Dust" by <a href="Akkadia%20Press%20Ltd.">Akkadia Press Ltd.</a> in 2017.

Early life.
Born in Lebanon in 1966, Gibeily attended studies in Beirut. Following the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War, a number of educational institutes and colleges were closed, thereby displacing an appreciable portion of pupils from the "familiar and safe ... area[s]" and suffering a collapse of their school lives.
Subsequently, Gibeily completed his studies in England, first at the <a href="Oratory%20School">Oratory School</a>, before reading engineering at <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> where he was awarded an M.A..

Later life.
Gibeily's employment has been varied: he worked as a journalist for various newspapers and magazines in the 1990s and early 2000s, including the "Daily Star" in Lebanon. In 1997, he wrote "Blueprint for a Prophet", which was published by <a href="Doubleday%20%28publisher%29">Doubleday publisher</a>. Prior to that, he worked as editor with the United Nations (UN) and a chocolate salesman in Dubai. As of 2017, he resides in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and two children. The author has latterly had published Greater than a Wall in the UK.

Written literature.
Summary of "Blueprint for a Prophet".
The book is largely set in Lebanon during the <a href="Lebanese%20Civil%20War">Lebanese Civil War</a>, expatiating the fear caused by religious conservatism. The novel entails the childhood of Samir Khoury who ruminates over his Greek nationality and forms the avocation of numismatics of Greek, Hellenistic <a href="Tetradrachm">tetadrachms</a>. In conjunction, the story interweaves the deviltry of the 'Chosen One' named Khaled whose philosophical amorality develops from an unloved child into a terrorist vizier and leader of the 'Watan Arabi', 'Country of Arabs' during 2026. Ultimately, the English girl Maira formulates her theory of the 'Chronon Theory of Time' which carves the avenue to her employment within <a href="SETI%20Institute">SETI Institute</a> and the equivocal coincidence of '616', the archaic number of the devil.
Jacqueline Jondot, Professor at the University of Toulouse, acclaimed the literature as an exploration of 'les jeux de l’amour et de la mort', 'the joys of love and of death'.

Summary of "Greater than a Wall".
"Greater than a Wall" presents a cataclysmic confusion between two families, the Israeli Lunzers, comprising Aaron and his son Avi and the Zeitunis, Palestinian olive agriculturalists whose olive farm is bisected and consequently ruined by the wall which intersects the West Wall. Avi, extorted by his father to complete his conscribed military, Israeli service, is caught in suspicious incident of a suicide-bombing attack by the gate at <a href="Qalqilya">Qalqilya</a>. Aron Lunzer investigates the incident of a fallen Israeli soldier under a surrogate anglicised name of Aron Lounger. His endeavors provide a route to encountering Lebanese Francophile Bernadette. In synergy, the two individuals uncover the abominable truth of the purported attack upon the IDF base.

Summary of "Pairing the Twain".
When an experiment concerning gravity and egocentric spin go disastrously askew, the scientist George is projected into an alternative plane of existence, transported in mind into a reptilian body. He discovers his androgynous status as 'he' and 'she' among a bipedal society of undifferentiated civilians. Accosted by Khab, Chief Scientist, he discovers that he is the sole individual responsible for Earth's looming fate.

Chronon Theory of Time (CTT).
"Not to be confused with the <a href="Chronon">Chronon</a>"
<br>
The published novels "Blueprint for a Prophet" and "Pairing the Twain" feature a salient theory of time entitled, 'CTT'. The CTT, should not to be confused with the chronon theory, positing a non-continuous progression of time, or the 'chronon', the necessary time taken for one photon of light to traverse the classical radius of the electron. The CTT evaluates the passage of time as the flow of quantum-time particles through the fabric of matter, thereby 'displacing' the matter in time. The CTT is in accord to the <a href="A-theory%20of%20time">A-theory of time</a> devised by McTaggart, whereby time is esteemed asymmetric and possessing clear <a href="Tense">tense</a> and an arrow of time. 

Within "Blueprint for a Prophet", the astrophysicist Maira analogises the progression of time to three entities of differing magnitude who stroll a coastline: an ant, a man and a giant. These entities, as theorised in Blueprint for a Prophet, will (a) devise a meter corresponding to its own magnitude and therefore (b) perceive the fractal distance differently in proportion to the size. Analogously, the passage of time is relative to the agent and his mass, density and volume. 

Integrally to the principal publication, time is reported by the author to dilate, proportionate to the expansion factor of the universe. Consequently, telecommunications received from ancient civilisations are postulated to cover a briefer time-frame than the modern relative second.

Chen Tsiao-long (; born 1 October 1953) is a Taiwanese politician who served two terms as a member of the <a href="Legislative%20Yuan">Legislative Yuan</a> from 2002 to 2008.

Education.
Chen studied electrical engineering at the <a href="National%20Taipei%20University%20of%20Technology">National Taipei University of Technology</a>.

Political career.
Chen served on the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Republic%20of%20China%29">National Assembly</a> before taking office in the <a href="Legislative%20Yuan">Legislative Yuan</a>. In the 2001 legislative elections, Chen Tsiao-long and <a href="Chen%20Chin-te">Chen Chin-te</a> formed an electoral coalition with four other politicians. As the election drew nearer, Chen campaigned alongside <a href="Wang%20Shu-hui">Wang Shu-hui</a> and <a href="Lai%20Chin-lin">Lai Chin-lin</a>. Chen Tsiao-long won a second term in 2004, and was renominated for a third after defeating <a href="Shen%20Fa-hui">Shen Fa-hui</a> in a party primary. During his third legislative campaign, Chen was placed under investigation of electoral fraud, and he subsequently lost to <a href="Lee%20Ching-hua">Lee Ching-hua</a> in January 2008. Days after the election, Chen was indicted on charges of vote buying. While a member of the Legislative Yuan, Chen also served on the Democratic Progressive Party's Central Review Committee, and as convenor of the legislature's Transportation Committee.

Chen backed pension reform, and supported tougher laws on privacy of personal information.

Chen was also active in discussions on foreign relations, advocating in December 2002 that a ban on Indonesian workers remain in place after <a href="Hassan%20Wirajuda">Hassan Wirajuda</a> stated that Taiwanese government officials were not welcome in Indonesia. In 2007, Chen supported a proposed referendum to replace the Republic of China with Taiwan as the nation's official name, believing that the referendum could invalidate the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China">Constitution</a>'s articles on retaining the Republic of China as the official name.

Chen was injured in a traffic collision en route to an campaign event for <a href="Luo%20Wen-jia">Luo Wen-jia</a> in 2005, and resolved to promote amendments to the Road Traffic Management and Punishment Law. His efforts were largely unsuccessful until 2006, when <a href="Jason%20Hu">Jason Hu</a> and his wife were hurt in a similar incident. Though fines were introduced for drivers if passengers were not wearing seat belts while traveling on freeways, a related proposal to make seat belt use compulsory did not pass at the time. A bill proposed by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Transportation%20and%20Communications%20%28Taiwan%29">Ministry of Transportation and Communications</a> in 2011 was later passed and took effect as law, with a special provision that placed fines directly on the passengers of taxis if they did not comply with verbal and written instructions for seat belt use.

Ingando

Ingando are <a href="Rwanda">Rwandan</a> political and civic reeducation and indoctrination camps. Created by the ruling party of <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, the <a href="Rwandan%20Patriotic%20Front">Rwandan Patriotic Front</a> (RPF), participants in military uniform live together and participate in shared activities.

History.
Ingando originates in the RPF and was most likely initially practised during the run-up to war so as to increase mobilisation.

In the aftermath of the <a href="Rwandan%20Civil%20War">Rwandan Civil War</a> and <a href="Rwandan%20genocide">genocide</a>, the <a href="Rwandan%20Patriotic%20Front">Rwandan Patriotic Front</a> took control of the country. The first ingandos afterwards were for Tutsi returnees.

During the period of initial post-genocide recovery, the government created a number of programmes so as to aid recovery. From 1996 to 1999, the ingando programme was administered by the Ministry of Youth, Culture and Sports. Thereafter, the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission took over.

Activities.
There were a number of streams in ingando until the implementation of itorero in 2007, an "advanced" programme for students.
Mgbako (2010) also makes a distinction between ingandos for different classes of person, namely "politicians, church leaders, community leaders, ex-combatants, ex-soldiers, students, prostitutes, gacaca judges, genocidaires, and women's associations". Regardless of which is correct (or whether both are correct and pertain to ingando at different times), both agree that there is variation in one's experience of ingando.

Some ingando camps are for ex-rebels. These camps are administered by the Rwanda Demobolization and Reintegration Commission. Participants take part in classes on "civic education, unity and reconciliation, government programs, psychological demilitarization, reintegration into civilian live and HIV/AIDS". Many participants return home after the programme. Others are encouraged or forced to join the Rwandan military.

Purdeková also claims that some camps are "run like military camps and ... [include] military training", but it is unclear this is a reference to the same set of camps.

<doc id="54784271" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54784271" title="Battle of Andoain">
Battle of Andoain

The Battle of Andoain (<a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a>: Andoaingo Gudua) was a battle fought on 14 September 1837, during the <a href="First%20Carlist%20War">First Carlist War</a> in northern Spain. The action took place in <a href="Andoain">Andoain</a>, south of the main Liberal stronghold of <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a>. Liberal troops, led by the Spanish General <a href="Leopoldo%20O%27Donnell%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Tetuan">Leopoldo O'Donnell</a>, had captured Andoain on 9 September, driving the Carlist garrison to the western bank of the river Oria. Then followed a three-day period of breastwork building by both sides and sporadic fighting. After two days of <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>, the Carlist poured heavy artillery fire on the Liberals lines and launched an all-out offensive by midday supported by reinforcements brought in from <a href="Navarre">Navarra</a> by General José Ignacio de Uranga. The Liberals were flanked on their left wing, and their lines crumbled. Only two <a href="Auxiliary%20Legion">British Auxiliary Legion</a> Regiments and a number of their local guides, the <a href="Chapelgorris">Chapelgorris</a>, were left to resist the Carlist advance, but were eventually outnumbered and overran. Most of the British who surrendered to the Carlists were executed, accused of the burning of several local farms in the previous days. The battle suppossed the end of the British Auxiiary Legion as an effective fighting force, with two-thirds of their members killed, wounded or executed by the Carlists and local civilian residents. General O´Donnell and the remains of his forces withdrew to <a href="Hernani%2C%20Gipuzkoa">Hernani</a>.

Background.
After the <a href="battle%20of%20Oriamendi">battle of Oriamendi</a> in March 1837, with the morale of the Carlist army on the rise, royal pretender <a href="Infante%20Carlos%2C%20Count%20of%20Molina">Carlos María Isidro de Borbón</a> conceived a thrust of his army through <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a>, <a href="Catalonia">Cataluña</a> and <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a> to take supplies and reinforcements from their allies in the region, and later carry out an all-out offensive on Madrid. The main reason behind the operation was to lift the Liberal blockade of the Basque provinces, which was taking effect on the economy of these Carlist-held areas. The plan is referred to by historians as the "Royal Expedition". The British Auxiliary Legion, which had been badly beaten at Oriamendi and was based at San Sebastián, took advantage of the circumstances to lead a Liberal offensive along the Cantabrian coast, only defended by isolated garrisons. The Liberals only found some resistance at Irun, which was taken by assault and plundered on 17 May. When the Carlist troops were approaching Madrid, Spanish Liberal General O'Donnell left the besieged San Sebastián to launch a successful offensive to the south, on Hernani and <a href="Urnieta">Urnieta</a>. The Carlists retreated to the other side of the rivers Oria and <a href="Leitzaran">Leitzaran</a>, near Andoain.
Buildup.
On 8 September 1837, O'Donnell massed a 7,000-men strong force to advance on the Carlist lines between the villages of Hernani and Urnieta. The Liberals pushed their enemies towards the natural barrier formed by the rivers Oria and Leizaran, where the two armies stood facing each other at a distance of a mere 200 yards. O´Donnell established his headquarters at Andoain, which lays on the main road between San Sebastián and the Carlist stronghold of <a href="Tolosa%2C%20Spain">Tolosa</a>. The Carlist forces, composed of five <a href="Guipuzcoa">Guipuzcoa</a>n battalions and an improvised militia of local residents, controlled the western bank of the river Oria. The opposing forces started to fortified their positions and entrenchments, O´Donnell men by rebuilding the town's fortress, destroyed by the retreating rebels, and the Carlist faction by setting up a six-feet high barricade with a number of embrasures that enabled them to keep the town under fire. The wall had the shape of a horseshoe, following the course of the stream, with the convex side aimed to Andoain. The extreme left ended up in a bunker, where the Carlists mounted a permanent watch. The narrowness of the stream and the main bridge made any force attempting to cross the river an easy target for the rebels. The accurate fire from the parapets indeed hampered the Liberals building of their own breastworks. The Carlist bunker was connected with their rearguard by a ravine which edges were protected by rocky crags, while the gaps were closed with casket filled with clay and stones. This means that any reinforcement or movement out or into the bunker and eventually to the barricade became unnoticed to the Liberals. On the right side of the trenches, the terrain allowed O'Donnell to command the enemies' positions, which were occasionally checked by the British artillery, which provoked a number of casualties among the Carlists when their rounds struck home. The British battery was made of two nine pounders and one twelve-pound howitzer. In the course of these skirmishes, two British officers were wounded by snipers. The Spanish Liberal troops were stationed to the left and to the right of the fortifications, while two companies of British Rifles were deployed in several outposts along the river. In order to reprive Carlist sympathizers of supplies, British troops set 126 barns on fire. This action enraged the local residents, who sought revenge by moving en masse to the Carlist zone and joining the rebel ranks. A British regular force of Royal Marines and Royal Artillery deployed in Hernani, but did not intervene in the following actions.

The battle.
During the buildup process, Navarrese troops lead by General José Ignacio de Uranga, departing from <a href="Arr%C3%B3niz">Arróniz</a> in Navarre, sneaked through the valley between Tolosa and Andoain. This reinforcement increased the strength of the rebel army to some 3,000 soldiers. In the morning of 14 September, the loyalists found that two artillery emplacement had been mounted on the palisade. Five rebel cannons began to poured heavy fire on the Liberal forces at Andoain itself. The British battery returned fire, and claimed to have silenced one of the pieces. The exchange lasted until 11 o'clock, when the rebel infantry emerged from their entrenchements and supported by intense musketry fire, advanced on the left and right flanks of the Liberal army. Uranga's plan was to lure the main body of the Liberal army to their right, north of Andoain, and then launch a two-pronged attack on the weakened center and left. The British Rifles and Scottish regiments were in the center, watching the main bridge on the river Oria, along with the Basque militia loyal to the Spanish government, known as the Chapelgorris. The Chapelgorris were forced to abandon their posts at the bridge after fierce fighting, as the right wing of the Carlist attack made gains on the eastern bank of the river. 

According to British sources, it was at this stage of the battle that Colonel F. R. Clarke, in charge of a Scottish regiment, mustered a column of near 300 troops in the town's main square and launched a bayonet attack in the direction of the bridge, which eventually drove the Carlists back to the river's edge. Earlier in the battle, however, O'Donnell had moved the "Gerona" battalion, made up of veteran Spaniard soldiers who had kept at bay the Carlist forces on the left flank over the past days, to meet what he perceived as the main Carlist effort on his right, replacing them by the unexperienced troops of the "Infanta Isabel" battalion. These young recruits fled in panic when rebel forces reached the eastern bank of the river Oria. Their retreat allowed the Carlist army to flank the British from their left. The artillery wagon of the Legion, whose cannons had been emplaced on the right side of the fortifications, was forced to withdraw, defended by the British Lancers and returning fire whenever possible. Two British gunners were killed by counter-battery fire. At this point, Colonel Clarke's troops became trapped between the bridge and downtown Andoain, now occupied by the Carlists.

Clarke was last seen at the head of the bridge, where he received a sabre wound from a Carlist officer on one of his legs and fell from his horse. Clarke, with his left arm still in a sling from a wound received at Oriamendi, became prisoner and was executed the following day at Tolosa. One of Clarke's subordinates, Captain Larkham, was shot and killed by a sharpshooter while involved in a sword duel with a Carlist officer. After the action on the bridge, the Scotchs and two Rifles companies were cut off from the village's center. One of the Rifles companies keeping watch on the Carlist main breastwork, commanded by Captain Courtenay and two subalterns, was almost whipped out by the Spanish rebels, with only five survivors. The British stragglers fled in disarray, only to be killed by the rebels or died from exhaustion. The remains of Clarke's column, meanwhile, sought shelter in the local church. The thick walls of the building provided a good protection against gunfire, and in its stores were plenty of food and supplies, but the 25 soldiers eventually surrendered to the Carlists on 16 September, on the promise of mercy. 

During the withdrawal from Andoain, Spanish General O'Donnell had a narrow escape when his horse was killed by a Carlist bullet. Overpowered by the tumultuous retreat of his troops, O´Donnell fell into a ditch. He was rescued by Colonel Arbuthnot, a Scottish officer who has been in the Spanish service for 35 years. It was at this stage of the battle that a company of Lancers carried out a rearguard action, in an attempt to relief the Scotchs and Rifles surrounded in the village and recover a cart of <a href="Congreve%20rocket">rockets</a> overturned in the retreat. The cavalry charge into Andoain was eventually beaten off by the Carlists. The action resulted in the death of the company commander and aide-de-camp of Brigadier O'Connell, Mayor McKellar, and two ranks. A total of 13 British officers lost their lives at Andoain, some of them executed or lynched after surrender. The action lasted barely half-an-hour.
Overstretched by their own progress, the Carlists were forced to leave Urnieta, which was briefly retaken by the Lancers and other loyalist troops. The position, however, was deemed untenable by O'Donnell, who ordered his men to fall back to Hernani at dusk. The victorious Carlist troops rounded up 100,000 rounds of ball cartridges, 1,500 firearms, 199 rockets, 150 British tents, 3,000 pairs of shoes and three-day provisions for 10,000 men.
Massacre of British prisoners.
Although the <a href="Lord%20Eliot%20Convention">Lord Eliot Convention</a> put an end, or at least restrained the indiscriminate execution of prisoners, the Carlist usually did not abide to the agreement if they captured foreign combatants.
Most of the troops who laid down their weapons were summarly tried for arson and executed in sight, or lynched by local residents, men and women, whose barns and properties had been burned to the ground by the British troops the previous days. The burning of civilian residences and farms had been already denounced at the Carlist <a href="Provincial%20deputation%20%28Spain%29">Deputation at War</a> on the session of 10 September. The crowd cried out in <a href="Basque%20language">Euskara</a> "ez da cuartelic suematen duenentzat!" ("no quarter to the arsonists"). Spanish sources put the number of executions there at 60. All the British soldiers captured at Andoain were forced to march to the rebel headquarters of Tolosa, where they were likewise massacred on the main square. British army sources from <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a> reported instead that the British prisoners taken in Andoain were killed "in situ", exception made of 37 soldiers, 20 of them stabbed to death on the road to Tolosa and the remainder 17 executed by firing squad in the Carlist stronghold.

Aftermath.
The British Auxiliary Legion ceased to exist as an useful fighting force, with a total of 500 casualties, which represents two-thirds of the Legion strength. Some authors claim the execution of 150 officers and ranks after the battle. <a href="Alexander%20Somerville">Alexander Sommerville</a> lists 136 deaths, 131 of them from the Scotchs and the Rifles, without distinguish between killed in action and executed. Legion surgeon Henry Wilkinson and the British press of the time differ slightly from Sommerville, with 13 officers and 143 ratings either killed in action or massacred. Others sources referred to up to 25 officers killed. The heavy casualties, togheter with the chronic lack of payments and supplies owed by the Spanish government and the indifference of the British Crown led to the official dissolution of the Auxiliary Legion on 10 December 1837.

Spanish Liberal troops losses amounted to 320 killed and wounded and 114 prisoners. Some of the officers were slain by Spanish and British Lancers while deserting their troops. 

Uranga's army losses were minimal, with no more than 100 casualties, all of them wounded, according to some sources. Royal pretender Don Carlos celebrated the victory with a <a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a> at Tolosa, and established the "Cruz de Andoain" ("Andoain Cross"), a special condecoration awarded to the Carlist soldiers who had taken part of the battle.

The northern front stabilised between Andoain and Urnieta for the rest of the war. Before marching back to Navarra, Uranga built a defensive line, manned by four battalions. The new fortifications were designed by <a href="Prussia">Prussian</a> engineer Hugo Strauss, later replaced by the Spanish Policarpo Fuentes, and build in a mere twelve days by 800 workers. 
The Liberal army launched four limited offensives on the sector from October 1837 to June 1838, making modest gains, like the occupation of Lasarte and Urnieta. Elsewhere, the Royal Expedition eventually petered out outside Madrid, and the main Carlist army withdrew beyond the <a href="Ebro">Ebro</a> by October, after being defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aranzueque">Battle of Aranzueque</a>.

A <a href="Historical%20reenactment">reenactment</a> of the battle is held every year at Andoain, the only event of this kind in the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a> related to the <a href="Carlist%20Wars">Carlist Wars</a>.

At that time, she became the executive secretary of the international organisation, based in <a href="Geneva%2C%20Switzerland">Geneva, Switzerland</a>, serving in that capacity for twenty-three years. Between 1992 and 1998, she served as the International President of the organisation. In 1995, she was honored as the recipient of the <a href="Gandhi%20Peace%20Award">Gandhi Peace Award</a>.

Early life.
Edith Müller was born on 10 December 1922 in <a href="J%C3%A4gerndorf">Jägerndorf</a>, a part of <a href="Czech%20Silesia">Czech Silesia</a> to Rosa and Alois Müller. She was raised in <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> until the <a href="Sudeten%20Crisis">Sudeten Crisis</a> of 1938. The family fled first to England, and by 1939 made their way to Canada, where they were placed by the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway%20Company">Canadian Pacific Railway Company</a> to farm in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. Unable to sustain their family, they moved to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> in 1941, where Müller found work as a <a href="Charwoman">domestic labourer</a>. Unable to speak English, she was taught the language by <a href="Women%27s%20International%20League%20for%20Peace%20and%20Freedom">Women's International League for Peace and Freedom</a> (WILPF) volunteers, who kept track of the <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>n refugees and tried to assist them in making adjustments to life in Canada. Joining the WILPF, Müller found their message of <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a> and human rights inspiring, but lost touch with the group when she moved to <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> in 1945. In July 1948, Müller married Campbell Ballantyne, an official of the <a href="International%20Labour%20Office">International Labour Office</a> and moved with him to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> later that same year.

Career.
Upon her arrival in Switzerland, Ballantyne began work for the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>, in the publications section, as the deputy director. After five years, she left the post to care for the couple's four children. After twenty years of living in Geneva, she discovered that the headquarters of WILPF were located there and volunteered to serve in 1968. The following year, she became the Secretary General of the organisation, and accepted a full-time position to work on improving WILPF's interaction with <a href="NGO">NGO</a>s and the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN). In 1970, she attended the WILPF's Eighteenth Congress, held in <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>, which had a profound effect on her view of balancing freedom and peace. She recognized that if peaceful means of solving a conflict had been exhausted, there had to be a means to recognize that the oppressed were likely to resort to violence and members could support non-violence without condemning exploited persons who felt that other options did not exist. The debates that followed the meeting, resulted in a resolution that idealistic pursuit of pacifism could not replace the recognition that the ultimate goal of peace was to allow people to attain their liberation and live freely. In 1972, she became the coordinator of WILPF's work with the UN. Her Indian trip was followed in 1975 with an observer group which toured the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, which spurred Ballantyne to recommend that WILPF press for continued dialogue between the sides of conflict but remain neutral on issues such as violence and human rights abuses which resulted from, rather than caused conflict. She believed that the role of WILPF was to encourage both sides to find peaceful means to coexist without focusing on who was to blame for the situation or favoritism.

In 1976, Ballantyne was elected to direct the Conference of Non-governmental Organisations (CONGO) of the UN and served as its president for the next six years. As the first representative to hold the post from a peace activist group, she opened the door to the pursuit of disarmament goals. When the <a href="World%20Conference%20on%20Women%2C%201980">World Conference on Women, 1980</a> was held in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, Ballantyne served as chair of program development for NGO Forum, ensuring that there was strong emphasis on peace and disarmament in the discussions of the various workshops. She hosted two organising committees, one in Geneva and the other in New York City, to ensure that broad input from diverse groups formed the foundation of the conference. The following year, she helped develop a conference "Women of Europe in Action for Peace" with the goal of bringing together activists and feminists to study the fears propelling the arms race and develop programs for monitoring developments in peace talks. In 1983, Ballantyne was among 10,000 women who met with generals at <a href="NATO">NATO</a> headquarters to protest new missile deployments in Europe. The missiles were deployed despite protests and soon thereafter, the United States invaded <a href="Grenada">Grenada</a>. Coupled with US military involvement in the <a href="Contra%20War">Contra War</a>, Ballantyne chaired the "International Conference on Nicaragua and Peace in Central America" with <a href="Adolfo%20P%C3%A9rez%20Esquivel">Adolfo Pérez Esquivel</a> in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> in 1984 to discuss the escalating <a href="Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative">arms race</a>. Her focus on following both mainstream strategies to achieve peace and supporting organisations which refused to adopt traditional strategies became the basis of WILPF policy to adopt a two-pronged approach in support of peace activism. 

Ballantyne again served as chair for the planning committee of the NGO forum for the <a href="World%20Conference%20on%20Women%2C%201985">World Conference on Women, 1985</a> to be held in <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>. The Peace Tent, an idea pressed by Ballantyne, was set up on the lawn of the <a href="University%20of%20Nairobi">University of Nairobi</a> and became a focal point of the conference. At the tent, daily sessions were held where women discussed the impacts of war on women and children. In 1992, Ballantyne became the International President of the WILPF and served in that capacity for the next six years. In 1995, she was honored as the recipient of the <a href="Gandhi%20Peace%20Award">Gandhi Peace Award</a>.

Leyvachelys

Leyvachelys is an extinct <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="turtle">turtle</a>s in the family <a href="Sandownidae">Sandownidae</a> from the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> (<a href="Barremian">Late Barremian</a> to <a href="Aptian">Early Aptian</a>) of the present-day <a href="Altiplano%20Cundiboyacense">Altiplano Cundiboyacense</a>, <a href="Cordillera%20Oriental%20%28Colombia%29">Eastern Ranges</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>n <a href="Andes">Andes</a>. The genus is known only from its <a href="type%20species">type species</a>, Leyvachelys cipadi, described in <a href="2015%20in%20paleontology">2015</a> by Colombian paleontologist and turtle expert <a href="Edwin%20Cadena">Edwin Cadena</a>. Fossils of "Leyvachelys" have been found in the <a href="list%20of%20fossiliferous%20stratigraphic%20units%20of%20Colombia">fossiliferous</a> <a href="Paja%20Formation">Paja Formation</a>, close to <a href="Villa%20de%20Leyva">Villa de Leyva</a>, <a href="Boyac%C3%A1%20Department">Boyacá</a>, after which the genus is named. The holotype specimen is the oldest and most complete sandownid turtle found to date.

Fossils of a turtle found in the <a href="List%20of%20dinosaur-bearing%20rock%20formations">dinosaur-rich</a> <a href="Glen%20Rose%20Formation">Glen Rose Formation</a> of <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, informally named "Glenrosechelys brooksi", have been assigned to the same genus and type species.

Etymology.
The genus name is derived from <a href="Villa%20de%20Leyva">Villa de Leyva</a> and "chelys" means "turtle" in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>. The species <a href="epithet">epithet</a> "cipadi" refers to the CIP; the <a href="Centro%20de%20Investigaciones%20Paleontol%C3%B3gicas">Centro de Investigaciones Paleontológicas</a>, the paleontological research centre outside Villa de Leyva.

Description.
The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> was found on the Loma La Catalina, west of <a href="Villa%20de%20Leyva">Villa de Leyva</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> in 2009. The fossil was discovered in a layer of calcareous <a href="claystone">claystone</a> with abundant occurrences of ferruginous-calcareous nodules and concretions. The section belongs to the middle segment of the Paja Formation called "Arcillolitas abigarradas Member" and has been dated on the basis of <a href="ammonite">ammonite</a>s to be Late Barremian to Early Aptian in age.

The turtle is the earliest recorded <a href="Sandownidae">sandownid</a> turtle in the world and the first of this family discovered in South America. The fossil find consists of a fairly complete skull, a well-preserved lower jaw and postcrania with an almost complete <a href="carapace">carapace</a>, three cervical vertebrae, right humerus and coracoid, both <a href="femur">femora</a>, <a href="tibia">tibia</a>e, and pelvic girdle. The length of the skull is estimated at and the maximum size of the carapace has been reported as . The carapace of "L. cipadi" is the first complete ever found for a sandownid.

Habitat.
The <a href="Hauterivian">Hauterivian</a> to <a href="Aptian">Late Aptian</a> Paja Formation is one of the richest <a href="list%20of%20fossiliferous%20stratigraphic%20units%20of%20Colombia">fossiliferous stratigraphic units of Colombia</a>, where other marine reptiles are found too. <a href="Pliosaur">Pliosaur</a>s as "<a href="Kronosaurus">Kronosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Stenorhynchosaurus">Stenorhynchosaurus</a>", <a href="ichthyosaur">ichthyosaur</a>s as "<a href="Muiscasaurus">Muiscasaurus</a>" and "<a href="Platypterygius">Platypterygius</a>" and a <a href="plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a>s known as "<a href="Callawayasaurus">Callawayasaurus</a>" represent the known marine reptile fauna assemblage of the formation. From the Paja Formation in the same year as "Leyvachelys", the oldest sea turtle known in the world, "<a href="Desmatochelys%20padillai">Desmatochelys padillai</a>", has been reported. The habitat of "Leyvachelys" is described as <a href="littoral">littoral</a>, not open marine as is the case for "Desmatochelys". Additionally, many different <a href="ammonite">ammonite</a>s and <a href="crustacea">crustacea</a>ns are described from the formation. The morphology of the shell of "L. cipadi", allows the support of previously hypothesized habitat adaptations for sandownids; in particular, that they inhabited <a href="littoral">littoral</a> to near-shore <a href="shallow%20marine">shallow marine</a> environments, and that their general body-plan was not designed for leading an open marine lifestyle. They nevertheless potentially shared niches with open marine turtles, as evidenced by the occurrence of <a href="protostegidae">protostegids</a> as "Desmatochelys", from the same stratigraphical horizons. The abundant occurrence of molluscs, principally ammonites, some of them preserved associated with the carapace of "L. cipadi", suppose a potential source of food for its durophagous diet adaptation which could have also included artropods, as for example crabs.

Fossil turtle fragments, initially and informally described as "Glenrosechelys brooksi", found in the contemporaneous to slightly younger <a href="Glen%20Rose%20Formation">Glen Rose Formation</a> of Texas have been assigned to the same genus "Leyvachelys". Both occurrences in Texas (paleocoordinates 30.0° N, 55.5° W), and Colombia (paleocoordinates 3.6° N, 42.2° W) represent the northern and southern paleocoastline of the Early Cretaceous proto-Caribbean Sea.
