Constables in the United States

In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, there is no consistent use of the office of <a href="constable">constable</a> throughout the states, and use may even vary within a state. A constable may be an official responsible for <a href="service%20of%20process">service of process</a>: such as <a href="Summons">summonses</a> and <a href="Subpoena">subpoenas</a> for people to appear in court in criminal and/or civil matters. On the other hand, they can be fully empowered <a href="Police">law enforcement</a> officers. Constables may also have additional specialized duties unique to the office. In some states, a constable may be appointed by the governor or a judge or magistrate of the court which he or she serves; in others the constable is an elected or appointed position at the state or local level of local government. Their jurisdiction can vary from statewide to county/parish and local township boundaries based on the state's laws.

The office developed from its British counterpart during the colonial period. Prior to the modernization of law enforcement which took place in the middle 19th century, local law enforcement was performed by constables and <a href="Watchmen%20%28law%20enforcers%29">watchmen</a>. Constables were appointed or elected at the local level for specific terms and, like their UK counterparts the <a href="Parish%20Constable">Parish Constable</a>, were not paid and did not wear a uniform. However, they were often paid a fee by the courts for each <a href="writ">writ</a> served and <a href="Warrant%20%28law%29">warrant</a> executed. Following the example of the British <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a> established in 1829, the states gradually enacted laws to permit municipalities to establish police departments. This differed from the UK in that the old system was not uniformly abolished in every state. Often the enacting legislation of the state conferred a police officer with the powers of a constable, the most important of these powers being the <a href="common%20law">common law</a> power of arrest. Police and constables exist concurrently in many jurisdictions. Perhaps because of this, the title "constable" is not used for police of any rank. The lowest rank in a police organization would be officer, deputy, patrolman, <a href="Trooper%20%28police%20rank%29">trooper</a>, and historically, <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a>, depending on the particular organization.

In many states, constables do not conduct patrols or preventive policing activities. In such states the office is relatively obscure to its citizens.

A constable may be assisted by deputy constables as sworn officers or constable's officers as civil staff, usually as process servers. In some states, villages or towns, an office with similar duties is <a href="marshal">marshal</a>.

Alabama.
In <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, a constable is traditionally elected in each <a href="precinct">precinct</a>, a subdivision of the state. Constables are <a href="Peace%20officer">peace officers</a> and have full powers of <a href="arrest">arrest</a>, stop and search within their county, except in certain counties which have had their constables' powers limited by act of the State Legislature (Etowah and Jefferson Counties) or counties which no longer have constables at all, also owing to an act of the legislature (Shelby County). They are generally responsible for serving <a href="Warrant%20%28law%29">warrants</a> and acting as <a href="Process%20server">process servers</a>, as well as patrolling the streets and providing security for civic events. They are not funded from general tax revenues; instead, constables' fees are paid by the <a href="Criminal">criminals</a> they arrest.

Alaska.
In <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, a constable is an appointed official with limited police powers. The <a href="military%20police">military police</a> arm of the <a href="Alaska%20State%20Defense%20Force">Alaska State Defense Force</a>, a voluntary state defense force, is designated as the constabulary force of the State. This agency is empowered to act in a police capacity when called into service by the Governor. Some official missions the constables have officially performed include port security after <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">9-11</a>, disaster relief, and <a href="Alaska%20Pipeline">Alaska Pipeline</a> patrols. They were put on initial alert to deploy to <a href="Bethel%2C%20Alaska">Bethel</a> in 2007 when 9 of the 11 officers of the city's police department resigned in protest over a pay and benefits dispute with city officials. They were not ultimately needed for that mission and were never deployed. Unlike many so-called militias, many of which are voluntary and non-state affiliated, even to the point of being derided by many military and law enforcement officials, the Alaska State Defense Force is state-recognized under the state's authority to have a state-exclusive militia or guard, in addition to the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a>. Alaska also has a naval militia composed of reserve <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">US Marine Corps</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Navy">Navy</a> personnel, who serve as needed, but not in conflict with their federal military reserve duties. The Alaska constables receive police training from the Alaska Department of public safety and most of the constables of the militia are former, retired or part-time law enforcement officers or correctional officers, and many are prior military. They act in an official police capacity only when called into service by the State of Alaska, which has a broad statute governing citizen's arrests, which is why Alaska has unarmed Village Public Safety Officers (VPSO's) all of whom are fully academy-trained, employed by local tribal non-profit corporations and are deputized by the Commissioner of Public Safety to make misdemeanor non-traffic arrests and charge for violations. Other similar officers are Tribal Police Officers (TPO's) of local tribal communities and Village Police Officers (VPO's) all of whom receive limited training. This is due to the scarce availability of law enforcement personnel in remote areas of the vast state.

Arizona.
In <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, a constable is an elected <a href="peace%20officer">peace officer</a> of the county for the <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace%23Arizona">justice precinct</a> and must live in the precinct to which they are elected. The constable serves a four-year term and has similar powers, duties and authority to <a href="Sheriff">sheriffs</a>. Sheriffs and constables are the only two elected peace officers in the State of Arizona.

The authority of constables is defined by <a href="http%3A//www.azleg.gov/arstitle/">Arizona Revised Statutes</a> Title 1, Section 215; Title 13, Section 105; Title 22, Section 131; as well as Title 13, Section 3804. Constables have similar powers, duties and authority as <a href="Sheriff">sheriffs</a>, but their primary responsibility is to execute court orders for the <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> or other competent authorities. Constables serve <a href="Restraining%20order">restraining orders</a>, <a href="summons">summons</a> and <a href="Subpoena">subpoenas</a>, <a href="Court%20order">court orders</a>, <a href="service%20of%20process">service of process</a>, <a href="Writ">writs</a> and <a href="Arrest%20warrant">arrest warrants</a>, and act as court <a href="Court%20bailiff%23united%20states">bailiffs</a>. Arizona constables differ from a sheriff in that they are not tasked with general law enforcement functions or operating the county jail. Constables are <a href="peace%20officers">peace officers</a>, but in Arizona do not perform general police functions such as patrol or criminal investigations. However, by virtue of their peace officer status, a constable may be required to take enforcement action to preserve life and property in immediate situations. Constables and their deputies may serve process, writ or papers in their county and any precinct in another county contiguous to their own precinct Some constables and all deputy constables are certified peace officers of this state.

Constables must undergo <a href="https%3A//post.az.gov/">AZPOST</a> training, and their expenses are paid by the <a href="county">county</a> <a href="board%20of%20supervisors">board of supervisors</a> and various grants. Constables receive a salary from their respective counties based on the number of registered voters who reside in their precinct. Most Arizona counties have between 2 and 6 constables. <a href="Maricopa%20County%2C%20Arizona">Maricopa</a> county has 26 constables, <a href="Pima%20County%2C%20Arizona">Pima</a> county has 10 constables, and <a href="Pinal%20County%2C%20Arizona">Pinal</a> county has 8.

Arkansas.
In <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, constable is an elected office at the <a href="Township%20%28United%20States%29">township</a> level, although constables are considered <a href="County%20%28United%20States%29">county</a> officers. The office of Constable, which is a <a href="Political%20party">partisan</a> office, is guaranteed by the 1874 <a href="Constitution%20of%20Arkansas">Constitution of Arkansas</a>, which provides for the election of a constable in each <a href="township">township</a> for a two-year term. Constables are <a href="Peace%20officer">peace officers</a> with full police powers.

California.
Historically, constables in <a href="California">California</a> were attached to the <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice courts</a>, the lowest tier of the state court system (whereas <a href="Sheriff">sheriffs</a> served the county <a href="Superior%20Courts%20of%20California">superior courts</a>). Depending on the county, constables were either elected by popular vote or appointed by the county supervisors to a <a href="Township%20%28United%20States%29">township</a> (later a <a href="Judicial%20district%23california">judicial district</a>). Constables had full police powers by state law and carried out occasional to frequent patrol work in addition to <a href="service%20of%20process">service of process</a> and serving <a href="Arrest%20warrant">arrest warrants</a>.

Legislation in 1923 allowed for creation of <a href="State%20court%20%28United%20States%29">municipal courts</a> in cities over 40,000 people, with <a href="marshals">marshals</a> to enforce their orders and provide security. As populations grew, and municipal courts pushed out justice courts, constables were slowly replaced by marshals. By the late-1980s few, if any, constables remained. Finally, the state courts were unified in 2000, with the <a href="superior%20court">superior court</a> fulfilling all judicial functions, the need for the position of constable was eliminated.

Connecticut.
There are two types of constables in <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>.

Special Constables are appointed by <a href="New%20England%20town">Towns</a>. In general, they are appointed to serve as police officers and expected to have or complete the requirements of the Police Officer Standards and Training Council in order to do so. Special Constables normally work under the supervision of a Resident State Trooper contracted by the town (a requirement of the <a href="Connecticut%20State%20Police">Connecticut State Police</a> if the town wishes their constables to be dispatched by the State Police or have access to the radio and computer system of the State Police). The system of Resident State Trooper and Constables is used by many medium-sized towns as a cost-effective way of providing increased police patrols while the State Police retain primary responsibility to provide additional levels of supervision, dispatch, Detective, and other specialized services.

Constables who are elected officials are generally limited to <a href="Service%20of%20process">serving civil process</a> within the town they are elected by. Elections are held every two years, except communities which by local ordinance or charter have set the term of office at four years. While a small number of towns will also allow the constables to perform <a href="road%20traffic%20control">road traffic control</a> and event security functions, most strictly prohibit their constables from acting in any official capacity on behalf of the Town. The authority to act as a <a href="law%20enforcement%20officer">law enforcement officer</a> by nature of their office was removed in 1984, at which time they became subject to the Police Officer Standards and Training Council requirements. In 1984 these requirements were for 480 hours of training, which could be completed in 120-hour-long "blocks" which were offered as part-time evening classes. With completion of each block came expansion of the types of law enforcement the officer could perform. While it was never common after 1984 to have elected Constables with law enforcement powers, there were a few who did complete certification. As of 2007, POST requirements of 680 hours of training provided on a full-time basis for new officers, followed by 400 hours of training provided by a certified Field Training Officer make completing the requirements to be a law enforcement officer impractical for elected Constables.

Historically, Constables had been the key office for providing law enforcement in rural Connecticut. Connecticut never developed a strong institution of <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States">County Sheriffs</a> providing general police services. From colonial times through the 1940s, Town Constables would work with two other Town officials—the Investigating Grand Juror and Prosecuting Grand Juror—in the initial handling of criminal investigations, arrests, and the "binding over" of serious crimes from the Town's Justice Court to a higher court. A series of reforms in regulations, statutes, and the state Constitution in the 1950s and 1960s removed the involvement of towns in these matters. In towns without a local <a href="Chief%20of%20police">police chief</a>, investigations became the exclusive responsibility of the Connecticut State Police, while State Prosecutors took over the prosecution of cases, and the court system was flattened by the elimination of courts with criminal venue below the level of the Superior Court.

Delaware.
Transplanted from England to <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a> in the early colonial period, the constable's main responsibilities were keeping the peace, serving the courts, and executing court orders and process. Under the Duke of York's government the constable was elected from one of four overseers of the town or parish. He had the responsibility to pursue and apprehend offenders and bring them before the justice of the peace, whip, or punish offenders by order of the court, take bail for a person arrested, help to settle estates, and keep proper accounts of fines collected. Legislation relating to constables does not appear in the Delaware Laws until 1770. This act required constables at the end of their terms to return the names of three freeholders to the Court of General Sessions, who then appointed one to serve the next year. At least one constable was appointed for each hundred, and appointees had to be residents of the hundred in which they served. After 1832 the Levy Court of each county appointed the constables, although the Governor could also fill appointments if Levy Court was in recess. The constable had a number of duties, many of which continue today. He executed all orders, warrants, and other process directed by any court, judge, or justice of the peace; ensured that the peace of the State be kept; arrested all persons committing riot, murder, theft, or breach of the peace, and carried them before a justice of the peace; attended elections to ensure that the peace be kept; and enforced the laws of the State.

(1) Justice of the Peace court constables are appointed by the Chief Magistrate. The constables duties include execution of court orders, writs and warrants, serving summonses and subpoenas, collecting debts and fines, and providing courtroom security.

(2) Any non-profit corporation, civic association, or governmental entity which has buildings and grounds open to the public may request for the appointment of constables to serve as law enforcement officers in order to protect life and property. The Board of Examiners shall appoint and commission such numbers of constables as it deems necessary to preserve the peace and good order of the State. To be approved by the Board of Examiners, a constable must meet the minimum standards established by the Council on Police Training. The constable shall exercise the same powers as police officers while in the performance of the lawful duties of their employment.

(3) Code enforcement constables are appointed by any county or municipal Chief Executive with limited authority to enforce only those ordinances pertaining to building, housing, sanitation, or public health codes. The Delaware SPCA may appoint animal control constables to enforce dog control ordinances and animal cruelty law.

Georgia.
In <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, constables are court officers whose powers and duties are: (1) To attend regularly all sessions of magistrate court; (2) To pay promptly over money collected by them to the magistrate court; (3) To execute and return all warrants, summonses, executions, and other processes directed to them by the magistrate court; and (4) To perform such other duties as are required of them by law or as necessarily appertain to their offices.

Idaho.
The office of constable was first established in <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> in 1887; constables originally attended the <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> courts and were officers of a <a href="precinct">precinct</a>. Although the Idaho Statutes still provide for the appointment of <a href="election">election</a> constables to keep order during elections (Title 34, Chapter 11) and define constables as <a href="Peace%20officer">peace officers</a>, the position was effectively eliminated in 1970, when the <a href="Idaho%20Legislature">Idaho Legislature</a>'s Election Reform Act removed all provisions for the appointment of constables. As such, there are no longer any constables serving in Idaho.

Kentucky.
In <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, constables are elected from each <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a> district in the state. There are between three and eight magistrate districts in each <a href="County%20%28United%20States%29">county</a>. Under Section 101 of the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution</a>, constables have the same countywide jurisdiction as the county <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a>.

Prior to the 1970s, the main function of the constables was to provide court service and security to the <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> courts. However, since these have been eliminated by judicial reform, the office of constable now has few real functions. Constables still have the power of arrest and to execute <a href="Warrant%20%28law%29">warrants</a>, <a href="Subpoena">subpoenas</a>, <a href="Summons">summonses</a> and other court documents, and are required to execute any court process given to them. On the approval of the <a href="Fiscal%20Court">Fiscal Court</a> (the <a href="legislature">legislature</a> of the county) they may equip their vehicles with oscillating blue lights and <a href="Siren%20%28noisemaker%29">sirens</a>.

Most constables in Kentucky are not paid a <a href="salary">salary</a>, but are paid fees for services rendered. However, state law provides for payment of an annual salary of $9,600 to constables in counties with a population of over 250,000; as of the <a href="United%20States%20Census%2C%202000">2000 U.S. Census</a>, this only applies in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville Metro</a>/<a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jefferson County</a> and the <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government</a>. The payment has become a point of controversy, since constables in Kentucky have few actual duties. The state has authorized a salary of up to $9,600 a year, but the <a href="Louisville%20Metro%20Council">Louisville Metro Council</a> cut it to $100 a month, plus expenses.

Anyone standing for election as a Constable must be at least 24 years of age, a resident of Kentucky for at least 2 years, and a resident of the county and district for at least a year prior to election. Since Constables are Constitutional peace officers they are exempt from attending the mandatory Department of Criminal Justice Training academy, although they may choose to do so. Sheriffs, Coroners, and Jailers are also exempted law enforcement officers. The Kentucky Constables Association is affiliated with the National Constables Association.

Louisiana.
In <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, constables are traditionally elected in each voting ward, which is a subdivision of a <a href="parish">parish</a>. Constables are <a href="Peace%20officer">peace officers</a> and have full powers of <a href="arrest">arrest</a>, stop and search within their ward. Some voting wards that are in large towns have a marshal instead of a constable, and these marshals serve the same role as a constable, although marshals are generally more pro-active in law enforcement matters. Not all large towns have the position of marshal though, as the City of Baton Rouge has a City Constable. Constables in Louisiana are generally responsible for keeping the peace in the ward. They are paid a small monthly salary for their service.

Maine.
Constables in <a href="Maine">Maine</a> have all of the powers and duties of <a href="police">police</a> officers once they have completed training required by the state.

Massachusetts.
The jurisdiction of Constables in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> is in most cases limited to the cities and towns in which they are appointed or elected, with limited exceptions. Constables usually serve civil process, they may however, serve both civil and criminal process and also enforce capias arrest warrants. M.G.L. c. 41 s. 98 provides the chief and other police officers of all cities and towns shall have all the powers and duties of constables except serving and executing civil process, allowing them to exercise common law arrest powers, state police are given the same powers throughout the commonwealth under M.G.L. c. 25 s. 97. Although the service of civil process makes up a major portion of their duties Massachusetts Constables have broad law enforcement authority. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stated in Harley v. Granville supra, "the general duties of a Constable are to be vigilant to preserve the peace, to prevent the commission of crime and to arrest all offenders who might be arrested without a warrant and to procure warrants in other instances of crimes committed." Hartley also states, Constables "are not expected to devote a considerable portion of their time to the work of their office or to quit his ordinary occupation to act as a detective and search for offenders. In this regard they stand on a basis quite different from the members of an organized police force." The Municipal Police Institute, now the MCJTC, issue a report in May 1977, on the powers of constables noting that modern police not only evolved from constables but they derive their common law powers arrest from constables, also stating "Constables still possess extensive law enforcement powers to this day".

A constable requires an extensive knowledge of civil law, and the criminal law aspects that may arise from civil law violations. In this regard courts prefer constable to handle these matters rather than police officers as they can execute both civil and criminal process.

A constable is, however, a public peace officer and requires a <a href="Surety%20bond">bond</a> as condition for faithful performance of their duties, and M.G.L. c. 23 s. 1 and 8 provides for their bond to be put in suit for failure to perform their duties by persons so aggrieved.

Michigan.
Upon gaining statehood, constables continued to be appointed at the county level as had been done when <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> was a territory. The <a href="Constitution">Constitution</a> of 1850, however, required that each township elect at least one but not more than four constables. The Constitution of 1908 continued the requirement. With few exceptions cities also elected constables by ward. In addition to serving the justice courts of their county, "constables have always been peace officers ... in the territory of their constituents," and, being constitutional officers, the legislature was without authority to limit the constables powers as they existed at common law. Allor v. Wayne County Auditor. 43 Mich. 76 (1880). However their role was vastly altered upon adoption of the Constitution of 1963 when their office was deleted as was the office of <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a>. They were not named as officers of the new <a href="Michigan%20district%20courts">District Court</a>. And by the end of the 1970s their election was no longer statutorily mandated. Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (MCOLES) certification became required if they were to perform general peace officer duties. As of 2007 there were very few elected city constables and less than 10% of Michigan's 1242 townships continue to elect constables.

Mississippi.
In <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, constables are law enforcement officers elected from single-member districts in each county. Mississippi law provides us with fewer than 35,001 people, to a maximum of five districts in counties with more than 150,000 people.

By law, constables keep and preserve the peace within the county; advise justice court judges or other officers of all riots, routs, unlawful assemblies, and violations of the penal laws; execute and return all processes directed to them by any county, chancery or circuit court (not just the Justice Courts); and attend the justices' courts of their districts.

All counties are required to provide their constables with at least two complete uniforms, some type of motor vehicle identification which clearly indicates that the motor vehicle is being used by a constable in his official capacity, and a blue flashing light for use on official duty. Other than standard fees for attending court, serving processes, etc., state law does not otherwise require counties to pay or otherwise compensate constables for their jobs.

Mississippi code Title 19 Chapter 19 defines the roles, powers, and duties of constables.

Nevada.
Basic authority.
Constables in <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> are elected peace officers who have statewide powers pursuant to <a href="http%3A//www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/NRS-289.html%23NRS289Sec150">NRS 289.150</a>, but 2015 legislation placed significant restrictions on those powers. Their peace officer power now is restricted to a) carrying out their official duties, b) preventing harm to a person or apprehending someone who has committed a crime against a person and c) with permission from a sheriff or chief of police. Constables must be <a href="http%3A//post.state.nv.us/">Nevada POST</a> certified category 1 or category 2 within 1 year of being sworn in, in order to keep their peace officer status and remain in office if they are urban constables, defined as those constables elected from townships with a population of more 100,000 in an urban county, or more than 250,000 in a rural county. In some rural Nevada constabularies, constables maintain POST status and others do not. All deputy constables must be POST certified in urban townships; in rural townships, they do not have to be certified, but if they are not, they may not carry weapons or exercise peace officer powers.

Hansen case.
There was some confusion over whether Nevada state law mandated that constables shall be peace officers a) regardless of what other provisions of state law require, b) the opposite; i.e., that state law requires that constables be certified peace officers to remain in office, or c) some nebulous legal point in between. Some of the confusion resulted from a 2002 elections case before the Nevada 8th Judicial District in Clark County, "Hansen v Bell et al.". In "Hansen" the 8th District ordered a candidate's name to be removed from the ballot in the election for Constable of the Township of Henderson because the candidate would not be twenty-one years old before taking office. An administrative regulation governing peace officer certification set the minimum age requirement at twenty-one on peace officers. The primary statute the District Court relied on was <a href="http%3A//www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/NRS-258.html">NRS 258.070</a> which states that constables "shall" [emphasis added] be peace officers in their township. On appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court reversed the 8th District. Furthermore, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that absent a statutory revision by the legislature, elected constables (but not their deputies) were exempt from the provisions of NRS 289.550, the primary statute establishing peace officer standards. <a href="http%3A//caselaw.findlaw.com/nv-supreme-court/1291279.html">Case Law</a> Pursuant to new legislation in 2015, most of the case is now moot.

Responsibilities.
The primary duties of constables are to act as a civil enforcement agency. This includes the service in minor civil cases in the Justice Courts of subpoenas, evictions, summons, vehicle and property liens, business seizures, and wage garnishments, and also enforcing vehicle registration laws and towing abandoned vehicles on public property. With the change in law in 2015, in those townships with constables, most of those constables are also conducting certain civil enforcement for the District Courts as well as, in some cases, the enforcement of civil bench warrants. While most constables limit their duties to the above, the Incline Village Township Constable's Office is an exception and actively engages in a variety of law enforcement services, under an agreement with the Washoe County Sheriff's Office. The East Fork Township Constable's Office provides certain court security services, under an agreement with the Douglas County Sheriff's Office.

Additional information.
Constables in Nevada serve a four-year term. In Nevada the office of Constable is the only partisan elected office below the county level. The office is not funded by taxpayers, but by fees collected for various forms of service. Constables are variously paid only token salaries and earn most of their compensation through fees or are paid a higher fixed salary but earn no fees. As of 2015 constables for the townships of Incline Village, East Fork, Humboldt, North Las Vegas, and Henderson are on fixed salaries. The office in Las Vegas Township has been taken over by the county sheriff. Not all townships have constables and the office is in abatement in most counties.

New Jersey.
A constable is considered a <a href="peace%20officer">peace officer</a> under <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> statutes. Modern-day New Jersey police officers inherit their authority from the constable. Constables may exercise their functions and perform their duties anywhere in the county wherein the appointing municipality is located. Constables are appointed by their city government (city council) via the Clerk's Office and their office term is determined by the municipal government body. They answer to the city council or police chief via monthly activity reports. There seems to be some confusion as to whether they should be identified as municipal, town, township, city or county constables.

Their powers are mainly focused on the enforcement of civil law although state legislature grants them the power to also enforce criminal and motor vehicle laws. Currently, there is legislation pending approval which will require all current and future NJ constables to undergo police training within six months of appointment.

New York.
Constables serve at the pleasure of the local towns and villages, usually in a civil aspect for the courts. However, constables are considered law enforcement officers under <a href="New%20York%20State">New York State</a> law. Their powers can be limited by each jurisdiction.

Constables are considered peace officers, have arrest powers within their jurisdiction while on duty, and must complete peace officer training as approved by the NY Division of Criminal Justice Services.

There are restrictions on whether appointed constables can have peace officer powers based on whether the municipality is a town or village and the number of residents. If a constable is not appointed as a constable with peace officer powers, they can only serve civil processes.

North Carolina.
Constables were abolished in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> in the mid-1960s. They were peace officers who served under the justice of the peace (JP) of each voting precinct. They were not salaried but received a fee of several dollars for each court order served from the presiding JP of their precinct. Constables were elected to four-year terms alongside that of the JP of their precinct and while they had full peace officer powers, their daily duties focused on serving orders of the JP and providing bailiff service to the JP court. In this revamping of the NC legal system, district court judges were required to be licensed attorneys at the same time that the office of constable, along with JP, mayor's court and city jail systems were phased out with the new NC court system changes of the mid-1960s. JP's were replaced by magistrates and the duties of constable were absorbed by sheriffs. Some cities continue to maintain temporary lockups, but city jails were abolished as a rule. Also in this set of changes, coroners who were elected judicial death investigators were generally replaced by medical examiners who were required to be a medical doctor, osteopathic physician, dentist, lawyer or veterinarian in the new system, though coroner still exists on the books in many NC counties.

Ohio.
The appointment of constables is authorized by the <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> Revised Code, which defines several roles for them. Constables serve as police officers of some small towns and <a href="Township">townships</a>, or as officers of some minor courts. A "special constable" may also be appointed by a municipal court judge for a renewable one-year term upon application by any three "freeholders" (landowners) of the county, who are then responsible for paying the special constable.

Duly sworn Ohio constables are considered <a href="peace%20officers">peace officers</a> under Ohio law, as are sheriffs, municipal police officers, state park rangers, <a href="Ohio%20State%20Highway%20Patrol">Highway Patrol</a> troopers, etc., and have full law-enforcement authority within their <a href="Jurisdiction">jurisdictions</a> (The Ohio Administrative Code defines a township constable's jurisdiction as statewide). With some exceptions, constables must post bonds and undergo police training. They are required to serve court papers when so ordered, and to apprehend and bring to justice any lawbreakers or <a href="Fugitive">fugitives</a>, suppress <a href="Riot">riots</a> or unlawful assemblies, enforce state law and generally keep the peace.

Pennsylvania.
Constables in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> are elected Peace Officers. In fact, <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Constables">Pennsylvania State Constables</a> were the very first form of Law Enforcement for the state of Pennsylvania.

Constables in Pennsylvania are elected and serve six-year terms. They are Peace Officers by virtue of the office they hold. Upon completion of Act 44 certification and training, they may also serve as the law-enforcement arm of the court. Constables primarily serve the District Courts but may also assist in serving the Common Pleas Court, when requested by the sheriff.

As public officials, constables are required to file an annual Statement of Financial Interests with the Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission.

Each constable may, with approval of the <a href="President%20Judge">President Judge</a>, appoint deputies to work under his authority. Each deputy is given the same authority as the constable himself, but serves at the pleasure of the elected constable.

The duty of the constable is to uphold the law fairly and firmly; to pursue and bring to justice those who break the law; to keep the peace; to protect, help, and reassure the community; and to be seen to do all this with integrity, common sense, and sound judgment.

Under Pennsylvania Law, Constables are Public Officers, elected or appointed to their position in accordance with the laws of the elections.

A Constable is a sworn Law Enforcement/Peace Officer that can arrest for felony crimes and breaches of the peace committed in his presence, or by warrant anywhere in the Commonwealth.

A Constable is also an officer empowered to carry out the business of the statewide district court system, by serving warrants of arrest, mental health warrants, transporting prisoners, service of summons, complaints and subpoenas, and enforcing protection from abuse orders as well as orders of eviction and judgement levies.

Constables are also charged with maintaining order at the election polls and ensuring that no qualified elector is obstructed from voting, Constables are the only Law Enforcement Officials permitted at the polls on election day.

While Constables primarily serve the Courts, they belong to the executive branch of government.

Constables are elected at the municipal level, however State law governs Constables and they have statewide authority, thus the title became "State Constable".

Constables are empowered to enforce both criminal and civil laws, Police Officers are empowered to enforce criminal and traffic laws, Sheriffs are the chief law enforcement officer of the county and are empowered to enforce criminal and civil laws. Sheriffs do have the authority to enforce traffic laws as defined in Commonwealth v. Leet (1994), however are not empowered to independently enforce DUI checkpoint as defined in Commonwealth John M. Marconi (2010).

Deputy Constables
Each constable may, with approval of the President Judge in the county the constable is elected in, appoint deputies to work under his authority. Each deputy is given the same authority as the constable himself, but serves at the pleasure of the elected constable.

Rhode Island.
It is noted in the <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> Constable Application that constables are not permitted to carry guns during the commission of their duties. One can obtain the official application at the Rhode Island Judiciary - Homepage. Also one should study the complete constable manual for the written examination given after training.

South Carolina.
South Carolina has several types of Constables described as a: State Constable, Special State Constable, Department of Public Safety (DPS) Special Constable and Magistrates' Constable. Constables are one of the State's earliest forms of law enforcement officer and they commonly served in rural areas where other types of law enforcement officers were not present compared to populated towns or cities. This is similar to their current purpose where Group I State Constables are typically Class 1 certified police officers at agencies that require law enforcement authority and a State Constable Commission establishes this authority by being appointed by the Governor. Group II and III State Constables work with law enforcement agencies on-duty as an auxiliary police officer. They also serve the public by use of their law enforcement authority when not actively working during imminent and urgent circumstances when it is necessary to preserve life or protect public safety with specific procedures set forth for Group III State Constables. A distribution of qualified personnel is provided to the public by State Constables and agencies that utilize them throughout South Carolina and they serve an important function within the overall scope of public safety as intended.

State Constables are appointed by the Governor of South Carolina (SC ST SEC 23-1-60) and regulated by the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) to serve the public and assist in the detection of crime and enforcement of the Laws of the State.

All State Constables are certified as qualified for public service as a law enforcement officer by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Training Council and this varies from Class 1, 2 or 3 Certification to Advanced or Basic State Constable Certification in order to comply with SC ST 23-23-40 titled Certification Requirement. SC ST 23-23-40 states, "No law enforcement officer employed or appointed on or after July 1, 1989 by any public law enforcement agency in this State is authorized to enforce the laws...unless he has been qualified as certified..." In 1989 all State Constables were required to be certified if they were to maintain a Commission since they serve as law enforcement officers and have authority to enforce the laws. And ever since, SLED has continued updating the standards of the State Constable Program with care to regulate these personnel as they serve the public by helping maintain peace as they have for hundreds of years, but with qualifications, training and standards that meet the current requirements of a law enforcement officer.

State Constables are employees of the State, including uncompensated/volunteer State Constables, as stated in SC ST 42-1-130. Additionally, they are provided insurance related to tort liability as specified in SC ST 1-11-140 and workers' compensation as specified in SC ST 23-1-60 and SC ST 42-1-130 while working in a law enforcement capacity.

State Constables are appointed officers and officially sworn peace officers authorized to enforce the Laws of the State with statewide jurisdiction as specified by law and their Commissions. As defined by SC ST 16-9-310 "Law enforcement officer" shall mean any duly appointed or commissioned law enforcement officer of the State, a county or municipality. Additionally, defined by SC ST 23-23-10 (E)(1) "law enforcement officer" means an appointed officer or employee hired by and regularly on the payroll of the State or any of its political subdivisions, who is granted statutory authority to enforce all or some of the criminal, traffic, and penal laws of the State and who possesses, with respect to those laws, the power to effect arrests for offenses committed or alleged to have been committed. As with Reserve Police Officers being "appointed officers" by county or municipal agencies and uncompensated volunteers, Group II and III State Constables are also "appointed officers" by the Governor after approval from SLED is granted and are also uncompensated volunteers. As with other States in the U.S., recognition of these auxiliary police officers designated in South Carolina as Group II and III State Constables and Reserve Police Officers as "law enforcement officers" provides for the necessary compliance with Federal and State Laws since they work on-duty for patrol and special events within areas currently designated as Gun Free Zones like schools and government buildings (except for Federal buildings and military bases where only Federal law enforcement officers have exclusive jurisdiction.) The South Carolina Attorney General has supported this recognition whereby auxiliary police officers are considered "law enforcement officers" and they comply with the laws related to possession of weapons (i.e. qualified service weapons only) in publicly owned buildings and schools and there is no requirement for them to be on-duty or in uniform to do so. This recognition is further supported throughout the Basic State Constable Training courses by the instructor along with multiple references within the Policies and Procedures published by SLED for Group III State Constables. The Commissioning of State Constables to enforce the Laws of the State with Regulation by SLED establishes compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations for them to serve as law enforcement officers.

When armed, State Constables have their credentials in their immediate possession for display if circumstances warrant.

Any handguns they carry are concealed unless they are in a state approved uniform. Credentials are issued by SLED and contain approval signatures and a photograph. State Constables are required to comply with the Federal and State Laws and Regulations governing actions of law enforcement officers.

A South Carolina State Constable Group I can be a uniformed police officer or a plain clothes investigator for the state with statewide jurisdiction. Agencies that have a law enforcement division or services (e.g. SCDC investigators, SC Dept. of Mental Health Public Safety, USCPD, CUPD, SCDHEC, state colleges, state universities) are commissioned constables through SLED (State Law Enforcement Division).

Group II and III State Constables serve the public and assist law enforcement agencies as a State reserve police force to help maintain public safety and officer safety for routine activities, special events, emergencies and fulfill needs for additional law enforcement personnel that arise during various circumstances.

Group II State Constables are retired police officers in good standing that can receive a State Constable Commission to continue to have authority and carry a weapon as set forth by SLED for Group III State Constables.

Group III State Constables are evaluated by the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division for meeting required qualifications. The candidate must submit an application to SLED for approval involving an evaluation to determine suitability to serve in a law enforcement capacity. This involves a review of personal and professional details, interviewing, a background check, medical evaluation, etc. If approved the candidate must complete the Basic State Constable training program unless existing law enforcement certification (e.g. Class 1) is current and accepted by SLED Regulatory. Candidates who are required to complete the Basic State Constable training program must acquire written authorization from SLED to attend and they must successfully demonstrate competency via certification testing prior to receiving a recommendation for a State Constable Commission. SLED generates a recommendation submitted to the Governor upon successful completion of all requirements, qualifications and certification test results. The State Constable Training Program is regulated by SLED and established by the SC Law Enforcement Training Council. Courses are presented by the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy instructors and Certified Law Enforcement Instructors. The Basic Constable Training manual consists of 395 pages of law enforcement officer training material covered in approximately 92 hours of classroom instruction at a Technical College in the State. This also includes Firearms Training and Firearms Qualification Testing administered by a Certified Law Enforcement Firearms Training Instructor. Advanced Constable training requires an additional 272 pages of law enforcement training material covering additional topics in approximately 60 hours of classroom and physical training including practical examinations. Both manuals are generated by the SC Criminal Justice Academy and are approved by SLED. Basic Constable and Advanced Constable Certification testing are administered at the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy.

Group III State Constables serve under the following conditions: 1. They can be assigned to work with agencies (e.g. Sheriff's Departments, Police Departments, University Police Departments, State agencies, Airport Police, etc.) for routine patrol, special events (e.g. festivals, fairs, school events, parades or other scheduled events of limited duration or emergency or critical incidents) and other law enforcement activities of the agency. They may also serve under other conditions as approved by the Chief of SLED. 2. They may take law enforcement actions while not working with an agency if encountering an imminent and urgent situation with either a threat to public safety or a need to preserve life. 3. They may take law enforcement action if an officer requests assistance or when assistance is not requested, but the need for assistance is obvious due to imminent and urgent danger of the circumstances.

Restrictions on Group III State Constables independently using their law enforcement authority (i.e. while not working with an agency) specify they may take law enforcement actions if encountering imminent and urgent circumstances when it is necessary to preserve life or protect public safety and they are required to notify the appropriate local law enforcement agency by the fastest means available as specified in the SLED policies and procedures. This detailed and restricted function identifies one of the most significant purposes of a State Constable in their service as intended.

Annual firearms qualification and annual training consisting of additional law enforcement officer training including standardized legal updates via in-service training are required for all South Carolina State Constables and all activities are required to be conducted in accordance with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Training Council and policies established by SLED. Group II and Group III (uncompensated) State Constables are required by law to submit quarterly reports with the Governor (SC ST SEC 23-1-80) via SLED Regulatory of all work assignments, training and actions taken as a law enforcement officer.

Many types of law enforcement officers have been created with titles throughout history. One of the most common types is 'Constable' and multiple references in South Carolina State Law describe various law enforcement officers having powers of constable with this authority originating from Common Law. Continual referencing by officials as to their authority and intent come from State Supreme Court rulings referenced throughout history in South Carolina with the following language, "...State Constables possess the authority of regularly commissioned peace officers, including powers of arrest." (State v. Luster, 1935), "Our Supreme Court has stated that constables perform all the duties of law enforcement officers and in particular 'a constable stands on the same footing as a sheriff.'" (State v. Franklin, 1908). However, with this language explaining their authority, State Law also specifies that SLED has regulatory authority of State Constables for specifying qualifications, training and general oversight of the State Constable Program including limits on use of their law enforcement authority. Constableship in South Carolina consists of a wide range of laws and regulations with the intent to help provide an effective and efficient resource of law enforcement personnel for the citizens and agencies of South Carolina.

Tennessee.
In <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, Constable is an elected position with full power of arrest and is a state peace officer. The <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Constitution">Tennessee State Constitution</a> was amended in 1978 so as not to require counties to have this office. Prior to this point, it was mandatory to elect constables in each county. Subsequent statutory law has allowed its continuance in certain counties, with the stipulation that there be no more than half as many constables in a county as there are county commissioners in that county, except in counties where the general law provides for an exception by county population brackets. Constables are elected to four-year terms in August, many of which are the years coincident with <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidential</a> elections, but not all. Some constable elections, as in Greene County are held during the presidential mid-terms. Unexpired terms may be filled by <a href="special%20election">special election</a>, but such special election must be held coincidentally with another scheduled election. An unexpired term may also be filled by an appointee elected by that county's legislative body. Candidates for office are not required to declare a party to run in many counties that still have them. In those counties, candidates may run as <a href="Independent%20%28politician%29">independents</a>, however in some counties such as Greene, it is a partisan election.

Texas.
The <a href="Texas%20Constitution">Texas Constitution</a> of 1876 (Article 5, Section 18) provides for the election of a constable in each <a href="Texas%20precinct">precinct</a> of a county, and counties may have between four and eight precincts each depending on their population. Currently, the term of office for Texas constables is four years. However, when vacancies arise, the commissioners coempowered police officers with county-wide jurisdiction and thus, may legally exercise their authority in any precinct within their county and adjacent counties; however, some constables' offices limit themselves to providing law enforcement services only to their respective precinct, except in the case of serving civil and criminal process. Constables and their deputies may serve civil process in any precinct in their county and any contiguous county and can serve warrants anywhere in the state.

The duties of a <a href="Texas">Texas</a> constable generally include providing <a href="Bailiff">bailiffs</a> for the <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a> court(s) within his precinct and serving process issued therefrom and from any other court. Moreover, some constables' offices limit themselves to only these activities but others provide patrol, investigative, and security services as well.

In 2000, there were 2,630 full-time deputies and 418 reserve deputies working for the 760 constables' offices in Texas. Of this number, 35% were primarily assigned to patrol, 33% to serving process, 12% to court security, and 7% to criminal investigations. The Harris County Precinct 4 and 5 Constables' Offices are the largest constables' offices in Texas with over 600 deputies each.

Utah.
<a href="Utah">Utah</a> Constables are appointed by municipalities whose courts they serve or elected to a precinct to serve the <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a> (JP) court. They are fully empowered <a href="peace%20officers">peace officers</a> but are not tasked with "General Law Enforcement Duties." They must go through the Utah <a href="Peace%20Officer%20Standards%20and%20Training">Peace Officer Standards and Training</a> (POST) certification, and be at minimum POST Category II <a href="peace%20officers">peace officers</a>. Like <a href="sheriffs">sheriffs</a> they may appoint <a href="deputies">deputies</a>. They serve process, provide court security (Bailiff duties), transport prisoners, seize property, enforce writs of all types and effect service of arrest warrants and may make probable cause arrests.

Vermont.
In <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, constables are generally elected by the <a href="New%20England%20town">town</a>. They are charged with service of process; the destruction of unlicensed or dangerous dogs or wolf-hybrids, and of injured deer; removal of disorderly people from <a href="Town%20meeting">town meetings</a>; collection of taxes, when no tax collector is elected; and other duties. Constables have full law enforcement authority unless the town votes to either remove the authority or require training before such authority is exercised. Cities and villages may also have constables. Their duties and method of selection are governed by the <a href="Municipal%20corporation">corporation</a>'s charter.

Effective July 1, 2010 Town Clerks must certify constables are duly elected or appointed and the town has not voted to limit the constable's authority to engage in enforcement activities. Further, Constables must certify they have successfully completed a basic training course and will complete the required annual in-service training.

West Virginia.
David F. Green of Davy, <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> was the last person to hold the elected office of Constable in West Virginia. 
The office of Constable was abolished in West Virginia in 1976.

Synopsis.
Don Tillman is an Australian genetics professor who probably has Asperger’s Syndrome, though this is never stated explicitly. In The Rosie Project, a romantic comedy, he met and married Rosie Jarman, a PhD candidate at a Melbourne university. The Rosie Effect is set in New York City, where Don and Rosie have moved – Don to take up an associate professor position at Columbia University and Rosie to undertake a Doctor of Medicine degree while she concurrently completes a PhD in psychology. Early in the story, Rosie becomes pregnant, and Don’s philandering mentor, Gene, who has left his wife Claudia, comes to live with them. The book follows Don’s attempts to prepare for parenthood and to support Rosie in her own preparation, drawing on science and the unreliable advice of his friends. Don’s unconventional approach alienates Rosie and eventually leads to the breakdown of the marriage. Don pursues Rosie and persuades her to return.

Film adaptation.
Sony Pictures optioned film rights to The Rosie Effect in September 2014. No plans for a sequel have been announced.

Reception.
Critical reception for The Rosie Effect has been mostly positive and the book was a bestseller in multiple countries. <a href="NPR">NPR</a> praised the book for not overly romanticizing Don, for achieving a tricky balance, and for its ‘classic Hitchcockian suspense’. <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a> included The Rosie Effect as the only novel in his Top Five Books for 2014. The Sydney Morning Herald, which had praised The Rosie Project, published two reviews, one of which criticized the novel as ‘formulaic’ while the second called it ‘a very funny book, possibly the funniest this year.’

Viola primulifolia

Viola primulifolia, commonly called the primrose-leaf violet, is a species of flowering plant in the <a href="Violaceae">violet family</a>. It is native to eastern North America, and possibly also to the Pacific Northwest. Its natural habitat is wet acidic areas that are usually at least semi-open.

It is a low, stemless perennial that produces white flowers in the spring. It can be distinguished from the similar-looking "<a href="Viola%20lanceolata">Viola lanceolata</a>" and "<a href="Viola%20blanda">Viola blanda</a>" by its leaves that are ovate, with rounded to truncate bases, and are 1.5-2 times as long as wide.

While typical "Viola primulifolia" occurs in a large area of the east, a variety of this species is sometimes credited to occur in a small area of western California and Oregon, under the name of "V. primulifolia" var. "occidentalis". These populations, which are considered rare and highly localized, have alternatively been referred to as "Viola lanceolata" ssp. "occidentalis".

Princess Hwapyeong

Princess Hwapyeong, or Princess Hwapyong (1727–1748) was the third daughter of King <a href="Yeongjo%20of%20Joseon">Yeongjo</a> of the Joseon dynasty in Korea. 

Biography.
The princess' personal name is unknown. She was born to <a href="Consort%20Yeong">Lady Seonhui</a> on the 27th day of the <a href="Korean%20calendar">4th lunar month</a>, 1727, in Chippok-heon (집복헌, 集福軒), ChangKyong Palace (창경궁, 昌慶宮). In 1731, she received her title "Hwapyeong", which means "peace". In 1738, the 14th year of King <a href="Yeongjo">Yeongjo</a>'s reign, she married Park Myongwon (1725-1790, Hangul: 박명원, Hanja: 朴明源), fourth son of Park Sajeong (1683-1739，Hangul: 박사정, Hanja: 朴師正) from the illustrious Bannam Park clan (반남박씨, 潘南朴氏). She left the palace on the 20th day of the 2nd month in 1742 for her in-law's family.

Princess Hwapyeong was King Yeongjo's favorite daughter. He loved her beyond all else and referred to her as his "intimate friend (知己)". His ardent love for her was recorded extensively in the Sillok. Princess Hwapyeong's wedding was extremely grand, and her dowry was said to be ten thousand times more extravagant than that of her elder sister Princess Hwasun's. King Yeongjo bestowed upon her a royal residence as wedding gift but his goodwill was declined by the Princess. 

On the 24th day of the 6th month of 1748, Princess Hwapyeong died due to a difficult child birth. On the day of her death, upon hearing that the princess was in a critical condition, King Yeongjo hastily visited her residence. She was subsequently pronounced dead. King Yeongjo was devastated and inconsolable over her death. He suspended all court affairs to mourn for her. He even moved his residence from <a href="Gyeongbokgung">Kyongdok Palace</a> (景德宫) to <a href="Changdeokgung">Changdok Palace</a> (昌德宫) in order to be near the location of Princess Hwapyeong's funerary observance so that he could personally oversee all affairs. He visited her residence frequently and broke down on five occasions before Princess Hwapyeong's burial. King Yeongjo made great efforts in seizing the most auspicious location for the burial ground of Princess Hwapyeong. He forcefully acquired a piece of ancestral land owned by the Paju Yun family, who had been staying there for generations, and evacuated hundreds of civilians from nearby villages to make way for Princess Hwapyeong's tomb. Princess Hwapyeong was buried in Munsan, Paju (파주, 坡州马山). Her elaborated funeral proceedings was comparable to that of a State Funeral.

Princess Hwapyeong did not conceive any child. King Yeongjo made the third son of Park Myongwon's eldest brother the adopted primary son of Princess Hwapyeong. 

In the memoirs of <a href="Lady%20Hyegyeong">Lady Hyegyong</a>, she described Princess Hwapyeong as being gentle and particularly kind towards herself and <a href="Crown%20Prince%20Sado">Prince Sado</a>. The princess was uncomfortable and distressed that she alone was showered with paternal affection and that her younger brother, the Crown Prince, was not. Whenever King Yeongjo found fault in the Prince, Princess Hwapyeong would side with her brother and pleaded ceaselessly with the King to be lenient. She was said to have mitigated the relationship between the King and the Prince and made a great deal of difference in her brother's favor. Until her death in 1748, she was the main protector of Prince Sado. Lady Hyegyong claimed that during the pregnancy of her first child, she often dream of Princess Hwapyeong coming to her bedchamber, sat next to her and sometimes smiled at her. When her first son was born, he bore the same birth mark as Princess Hwapyeong and King Yeongjo took him as the reincarnation of the Princess.

Eulogies.
Yearning for my elder sister Princess Hwapyeong 

The flowers of the cherry trees are blooming in spring, brilliant leaves among scarlet petals. For how many times did my sister come to my rescue in my plight? Other were keen, yet helpless. I have only so few sisters born of the same mother. (We were like) wild geese having fun flying across the Sushui River together. Till the Mujin year (1748), I have been showered in your grace. And now, all of a sudden, you passed away. How sad! I do not know how my elder brother looked like. Who else could relieve my sorrow? Morning drums thundered. I could not fall asleep. Sound of the pan (hitting the bells) in discord. Servants clad in purple coat send morning greetings. Looking back to the days (we had at the) waterfront pavilion, I was in a daze throughout the night. I eschewed my own desolation to console my grieving mother. Riding on chariots, sorrows soared into the ninth Heaven. Feathery flags fluttering along the celestial path. Illness did not erode the filial piety in you. You would remind me to be diligent in my studies. Even in dreams, you would send regards to inquire about His Majesty’s health. Should I joy or mourn? I must be looking haggard, for tears are streaming down my cheeks as if a river breached its banks. Who had no brothers? To whom could I pour out my heart to? In the northern garden, the moon shore on the pine forest. Underneath the eastern hill, wild birds shrieking. How could (a bird) fly with broken wings? It is such a pity that yellow birds did not have a hundred lives. The flock of wild geese is shrinking with just three of us left. Tree branches rustling, I sink into deep melancholy. Are dreams real or is reality a dream? Embraced by the cherry blossoms, I coalesced my thoughts to let bitterness fade with time. Times flies relentlessly, like the water that flows and never returns. 

Eulogy written for Kumsongwi Park Myongwon and Princess Hwapyeong 

My second aunt was virtuous and kind. My deceased grandfather loved her dearly. (He) married (her) into an illustrious family, gifted a fine residence (to the couple) and showered them with precious jade and gold jewelries. Husband and wife loved and respected each other like the harmonious resonance of the lute and psaltery. (My aunt's) character was as exemplary as that of the Queen of King Wen. The ladies-in-waiting praised her for her devotion to her brother. She helped him on various matters, going back and forth using all means to do whatever she could. When the female phoenix demises, the male phoenix retreats. But your legacy lingered on. Returning to the Palace of Lu, I could still recall your sincere advice. You were diligent in your duties and courteous to your subordinates. If I visit your tomb and find it in a derelict state, I would not be able to sleep in peace. It would bother me for another ten years. Well-versed in Cheng-Chu classics, you never failed to be genuine in sharing your thoughts (to me). Whenever I look over to the mountain (where you are buried), I see a pearl in the dragon’s mouth. Capable man were summoned (to select the location) through divination. It would bring abundant peace and prosperity to our descendants for many years to come. You had been the pillar for our country and brought honor to your clan. Passing away holding high official position, and accomplishing all “four beautiful elements”, you drew admiration from your colleagues. Now I am revisiting Paju with mixed feelings. How could the praises on your tomb stone sing enough of your achievements? Due to the strict code of conduct, I could only pass by your grave in a chariot. Thus, I have specially asked your nephew to pour you (on my behalf) yet another glass of wine

Karl Obermann

Karl Obermann (22 September 1905 - 10 July 1987) was a <a href="Germany">German</a> historian. He became the first director of the Historical Institute of the <a href="German%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20at%20Berlin">(East) German Academy of Sciences and Humanities</a>.

Life.
Karl Obermann was born in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>. His father was a factory worker. There was no money for him to progress to a university level education so after leaving secondary school he undertook an apprenticeship in technical drawing. Obermann became unemployed in 1928. He was able to attend lectures at <a href="University%20of%20Cologne">the university</a> in Sociology and Economic History as a . During this time he was supporting himself, at least in part, through freelance journalism.

Obermann discovered the young socialist movement through the <a href="Wandervogel">"Wandervogel" hiking clubs</a>. Sources are not unanimous on the date, but it seems most likely that following several year as an active member of the , it was in 1931, by now aged 23, that he joined the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democratic Party (""Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands"" / SPD)</a>. Two years later he switched to the newly formed <a href="Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Germany">Socialist Workers' Party (""Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands"" / SAPD)</a>, which had been formed by SPD members who had become convinced that the best chance of reversing the surge in support for <a href="Nazi%20Party">nationalist populism</a> lay in uniting the SPD and the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany">Communist Party</a>. That aspiration failed spectacularly. In January 1933 the Nazis <a href="Machtergreifung">took power</a> and lost no time in <a href="Gleichschaltung">transforming</a> the country into a <a href="One-party%20state">one-party</a> <a href="Enabling%20Act%20of%201933">dictatorship</a>. The SAPD never became more than a minority leftwing fringe group which fizzled out after 1945. With the Nazis in power, people with a political past were persecuted and in many cases arrested. Others fled. In 1933 Karl Obermann emigrated via Belgium to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> which was rapidly becoming a focus for growing numbers of exiled German communists and other left-wing activists.

In Paris during the 1930s Obermann was able to work as a free-lance journalist for various German language newspapers and magazines, reflecting the number of German political exiles living in the city. He published a few historical essays. He also took the opportunity to attend lectures on History at the <a href="Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a> - again, as a "guest attendee" rather than as a student of the university. He joined the exiled <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany">Communist Party of Germany</a> in 1936. <a href="Second%20World%20War">War</a> was declared in September 1939. Like many German political exiles, Karl Obermann was arrested and interred at <a href="Camp%20Vernet">Camp Vernet</a> in the far southwest of the country. The camp had been created a couple of years earlier as a transit camp for <a href="International%20Brigades">left-wing fighters</a> returning defeated from the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> and in 1940, though conditions were very basic, it was initially more a holding camp for "political undesirables" - many of them Jewish, reflecting the number of Jews among the German political exiles community that had settled in Paris - than the secure concentration camp it later became. Whether he was formally released or simply walked out of the camp gates, in 1941 Obermann managed to escape from France to the <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">United States of America</a>. He was able to do this on a ship sailing from <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a>, a well worn channel for German refugees, not yet fully closed off by the <a href="Vichy%20France">French authorities</a>, which avoided the visa issues involved in trecking across Spain and Portugal.

In the USA he came into contact with the "Council for a Democratic Germany" and became a contributing editor to the council's antifascist news magazine "The German American" between 1943 and 1946. In October 1946 he returned to Germany, travelling via the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and arriving in the central part of Germany that had been <a href="Soviet%20Military%20Administration%20in%20Germany">administered</a>, since May 1945, as the <a href="Soviet%20occupation%20zone">Soviet occupation zone</a>. Early on he became a member of the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">Socialist Unity Party (""Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands"" / SED)</a> which had been created under <a href="Merger%20of%20the%20KPD%20and%20SPD%20into%20the%20Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">contentious circumstances</a> in April 1946 and which, by the time the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the <a href="Group%20of%20Soviet%20Forces%20in%20Germany">Soviet sponsored</a> <a href="German%20Democratic%20Republic">German Democratic Republic</a> in October 1949, was emerging as the ruling party in a new kind of German <a href="One-party%20state">one-party</a> <a href="Constitution%20of%20East%20Germany">dictatorship</a>. Between 1947 and 1949 he was a contributing editor of the university news magazine, "Forum". He combined this with study at what came to be known, in 1949, as the <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">Humboldt University of Berlin</a>. Again, his subject was <a href="History">History</a>.

In 1950 he received his doctorate from the <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">Humboldt</a>. His dissertation topic was the <a href="German%20revolutions%20of%201848%E2%80%9349">German revolution of 1848</a>. Between 1950 and 1952 he taught at the <a href="University%20of%20Potsdam">Brandenburg State Academy</a> in <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>. Just two years after receiving his doctorate he received his <a href="habilitation">habilitation</a> (higher academic qualification) which opened the way for a career as a university academic.

Biography.
Eliya was younger nephew of patriarch <a href="Shemon%20VII%20Ishoyahb">Shemon VII Ishoyahb</a> (1539-1558), who originally designated Eliya's older brother Hnanisho as his successor. Several years later, probably because Hnanisho had died in the interim, patriarch Shemon VII transferred the succession to his other nephew, fifteen-year-old Eliya. Thus he became "natar kursya" (designated successor) of the Patriarchal Throne. In 1545, Eliya was made Metropolitan. His uncle, patriarch Shemon VII, died on 1 November 1558, and was succeeded by Eliya who became new Patriarch of All the East (designated as Eliya "VII" in older historiography, but renumbered as Eliya "VI" in recent scholarly works). During his patriarchal tenure, from 1558 to 1591, <a href="Church%20of%20the%20East">Church of the East</a> preserved its traditional christology and ecclesiastical independence.

Neerkol Creek is the south-western boundary of the suburb.

Fairy Bower is low-lying land, less than 10 metres above sea level, and contains a number of lagoons, including the Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon, the Crescent Lagoon, Nelson Lagoon and Deadmans Lagoon.

Big Bulls.
The roundabout (often called the Yeppen roundabout presumably taking its name from the nearby Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon) where the highways meet is well-known for the large statue of a <a href="Brahman%20%28cattle%29">Brahman</a> bull that stands in the middle of the roundabout, being one of seven <a href="Big%20Bulls">Big Bulls</a> that decorate Rockhampton, which regards itself as the Beef Capital of Australia. The group of bull statues are listed as one of <a href="Australia%27s%20big%20things">Australia's big things</a>.

This particular bull attracts some criticism for facing towards the city so approaching motorists are welcomed to the city by a view of its rear end which includes its large <a href="Testicle">testicles</a>. The theft of the testicles from the bulls is a common prank and they frequently have to be replaced. Some residents also feel that the bull statues over-emphasise one aspect of the city and should be relocated to less prominent locations. However, there is strong public support for the retention of the bulls.

Dunton Cove

Dunton Cove or the Covenanters' Cave is an artificial cave in a craggy outcrop of rocks overlooking the <a href="River%20Irvine">Craufurdland Water</a> just below the confluence of the Dunton Water and the Calf Fauld Water in <a href="East%20Ayrshire">East Ayrshire</a>, Scotland, close to the village of <a href="Waterside%2C%20East%20Ayrshire">Waterside</a>. Traditionally it was used as a hiding place for <a href="Covenanters">Covenanters</a> in the 17th century during the so called 'Killing Times' of the 1680s.

Cave and access.
The Dunton Cove is located in a stone cliff above the <a href="River%20Irvine">Craufurdland Water</a> on the east side of the water course, just off the private road leading from Airtnoch Farm through the forestry plantations to Craigendunton and the old reservoir.

The cave is only large enough for a few people and the regular lines of the rectangular opening add emphasis to its artificial origin or creation from a pre-existing cavity.
Several hand and foot holds have been cut into the rock face however access is difficult. Internally the cave has no special features such as a shelf for sitting and its therefore seems to have been used as a short term refuge used whilst soldiers were temporarily in the vicinity.

The opening is obvious from the level of the <a href="River%20Irvine">Craufurdland Water</a> and it is said that a bush such as gorse or willow would be pulled up and tied with ropes over the entrance as camouflage.

History.
The word "cove" in <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> means 'cave'. 

It is noted in the 1856 <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> 'Name Book', Volume 27 as being recorded on ""Mr. Craufords' Estate"" map and local information of its use by <a href="Covenanters">Covenanters</a> and its artificial origin was provided by Matthew Dunlop of Craigendunton and John Dunlop of <a href="Waterside%2C%20East%20Ayrshire">Waterside</a>.

No specific record of the cave's use are recorded however Covenanter sympathies were strong in the area and the 'Fugitive Roll' of May 1684 records ""Andrew Gemmil, in Bembreich (Benbeoch); James Lindsay and his son Thomas in Glerfin (Clanfin), and his son, Thomas Lindsay; James Howie and his son, John Howie at Lochgoin Farm and also living at Lochgoin was Isobel Howie, who is known to have gone into hiding after a raid on Lochgoin. Meadowhead and Airtnoch farms were rented by the Covenanter, John Paton.""

A story is recorded by one author of soldiers pursuing a group of Covenanters across the moors and upon reaching the Craufurdland Water they became aware that their prey had entered this cave and rather then soak their uniforms crossing the water course they instead fired a number of rounds into the opening and left satisfied that the men had been killed however having laid themselves on the floor they were in fact unscathed.

Several other caves in Ayrshire and beyond are said to have been used as places of concealment by Covenanters, such as the <a href="Cleeves%20Cove">Cleeves Cove</a> on the Dusk Water near <a href="Dalry%2C%20North%20Ayrshire">Dalry</a> and <a href="Peden%27s%20Cave%20%28Auchinbay%29">Peden's Cave</a> on the <a href="Lugar%20Water">Lugar Water</a> near <a href="Ochiltree">Ochiltree</a>.

Marlow was born in a hamlet called Thorney Lanes in the parish of <a href="Newborough%2C%20Staffordshire">Newborough, Staffordshire</a> about 8 miles west of <a href="Burton%20upon%20Trent">Burton upon Trent</a>. As a youth he worked in racing stables at Newmarket and Epsom. His first win as a jockey came in 1831 on a horse called "Gab" at the July Cheltenham meeting, riding at 7st. and later that year, at 6st 12lb, he won a race on Lord Warwick’s "Water Witch".

Marlow settled in Rugeley, Staffordshire, a short distance from the racing stables at Hednesford. The trainers who worked in the area at the time included Thomas Walters, Thomas Carr, William Saunders, Thomas Flintoff, and Samuel Lord. Owners who had their horses in training at Hednesford included Edmund Peel (brother of <a href="Robert%20Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a>), <a href="William%20Taylor%20Copeland">Aldermand William Taylor Copeland</a>, Captain Thomas Lamb and Lord Warwick. Marlow rode for many of them and had early wins on Copeland’s "King Cole" in the 1838 <a href="Chester%20Cup">Chester Cup</a>, and three days later for Captain Lamb in the Marquis of Westminster’s Plate riding "Chit Chat". Marlowe continued to ride for Alderman Copeland for several years, primarily in the Staffordshire and midland districts. He rode Copeland’s outsider "Mustapha Muley" in the 1841 Epsom Derby and "Combermere" the following year, both unplaced. In a review of the 1842 season he was among the country’s top winning jockeys.

The Flying Dutchman.
In the 1840s and into the 1850s Marlow had further success in top flight races. In 1844 he won the <a href="Royal%20Hunt%20Cup">Royal Hunt Cup</a> at Ascot on "Bishop of Romford’s Cob"; in 1848 he won the <a href="Goodwood%20Cup">Goodwood Cup</a> on Lord Eglinton’s "Von Tromp" and in 1849 the <a href="Ascot%20Gold%20Cup">Ascot Gold Cup</a> on the same horse; in 1849 he won both the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a> and the <a href="St.%20Leger">St. Leger</a> on Eglinton’s "The Flying Dutchman"; in 1851 he won the City and Suburban Handicap (Epsom), again on an Eglinton horse called "Elthiron", and in 1853 he won the <a href="Epsom%20Oaks">Epsom Oaks</a> on "Catherine Hayes".

"The Flying Dutchman" is now considered to be one of the top race horses of all times. He was undefeated until 1850 when he came up against <a href="Thomas%20Dundas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Zetland">Lord Zetland’s</a> "<a href="Voltigeur%20%28horse%29">Voltigeur</a>", the Epsom Derby winner of that year. This was in the <a href="Doncaster%20Cup">Doncaster Cup</a> in a two horse race over two and a half miles; <a href="Nat%20Flatman">Nat Flatman</a> was on "Voltigeur" and Marlow on the "Dutchman". From the off, Marlow set a remarkable pace but his horse started to tire. This allowed Flatman to ease back in contention and eventually win the race. The result stunned the racing world and reduced Marlow to tears. It later transpired that the animal may not have been at its best, having been over exerted in training, off its feed and giving away 19 pounds to "Voltigeur". It was also rumoured that Marlow may have been drinking before the race and this possibly impaired his judgement.

A rematch was arranged for the two horses and this took place at the York spring meeting on May 13, 1851 over two miles, with the same jockeys. There was huge public interest in the race (it came to be known as <a href="The%20Great%20Match%20%28horse%20race%29">The Great Match</a>) and even special trains were laid on from London. Voltigeur received only an 8½ pound allowance on this occasion and during the race Marlow played a waiting game, being behind by three lengths at the half-way stage. As they neared the finish he gradually overtook Flatman and won by a length. "The Flying Dutchman" never raced again but was sent to stud where he had a successful and influential career.

Final years.
In 1855 Marlow broke his leg when his horse, <a href="William%20Palmer%20%28murderer%29">William Palmer’s</a> "Nettle", fell during the running of the Epsom Oaks. The injury was such that a long layoff was necessary, and some observers even thought that his career would be over. Tattersall's started a benefit collection for him and a national newspaper reported it had reached over £600 by the end of July. In March 1858 a notice was placed in the London Gazette stating that "“Charles Marlow, formerly of Hazle Slade, in the parish of Rugely, in the county of Stafford, Jockey”" was an insolvent debtor. In July 1858 Marlow’s wife died and shortly after he was seeking a job as a private trainer. The reason given was that he could no longer make the riding weights for a jockey. Marlow had married Mary Anne Saunders (daughter of trainer Thomas Saunders) in 1844 and following her death it appears that their children were placed with relatives. The couple had at least six children, four boys and two girls. The eldest boys, Charles and Henry were living with their uncle, trainer William Saunders, working as stable lads (aged respectively 15 and 13). The youngest two boys, William and Thomas, were with another uncle on a farm at Great Wyrley. William was later at John Porter’s stables at Highclere from the age of 13, until his death in 1870 when he was 18. Of the two girls, Charlotte found work as a barmaid and Mary married a miner.
Marlow eventually made a return to the saddle in 1859 and his first race was in the Biennial Stakes at Bath on Colonel Pearson’s "Man-at-Arms". He rode for Mr Sutton and others before becoming the stable jockey for Tommy Parr in 1861 at his Benham stables, Letcombe Regis. His last race was in 1863 after which he worked at <a href="Tom%20Olliver">Tom Olliver</a>'s Wroughton stables. Olliver was concerned for Marlow's wellbeing; in an interview he told a reporter that "he [Marlow] shall never want a crust so long as I have one to give him". 

After the death of Olliver in 1872, Marlow was said to be living in "indigent circumstances".One of the owners with horses in training at Wroughton - Mr William Sheward Cartwright - started a collection for Marlow and became his benefactor by employing him as a helper in the stables. This was confirmed in a newspaper report for the August 1875 race meeting at York, where Marlow was identified as the groom for two of Cartwright's horses - "Louise Victoria" and "Maud Victoria" (full sisters to the 1874 Derby winner "<a href="George%20Frederick%20%28horse%29">George Frederick</a>"). In 1880 Cartwright sold off his horses and died later in the same year. In June 1879 Marlow was admitted to the Highworth and Swindon Union Workhouse. In the 1881 census Marlow's occupation is given as "Jockey, 1849 winner of the Derby with The Flying Dutchman". In October of 1881 he was admitted to the <a href="Roundway%20Hospital">Wiltshire County Asylum</a> where he died the following year.

Always On The Road

Always On The Road (), sometimes also translated as Never Ending Anti-Corruption Struggle, is an eight part television miniseries produced jointly by the <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> department of the <a href="Chinese%20Communist%20Party">Chinese Communist Party</a> (CCP) <a href="Central%20Commission%20for%20Discipline%20Inspection">Central Commission for Discipline Inspection</a> (CCDI) and <a href="China%20Central%20Television">China Central Television</a> (CCTV). Released after the CCP's <a href="18th%20National%20Congress%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20China">18th National Congress</a>, the program's primary focus is the CCP's <a href="Anti-corruption%20campaign%20under%20Xi%20Jinping">crackdown under Xi Jinping</a> against <a href="corruption%20in%20China">corruption in China</a> by showcasing its prosecution of high level corrupt officials.

The program ran for one season, broadcast between 17 October 2016 and 25 October 2016 at 21:30 on <a href="CCTV-1">CCTV-1</a>. The entire show was immediately available online as it aired for free on the CCDI's official website, as well as on <a href="Youku">Youku</a> and <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>, where it was uploaded by the CCTV's official account.

Name.
According to Chinese state-run media, the name of the miniseries was meant to allude to the fact that China's anti-corruption drive is "longlasting". The name of the miniseries came from a quote said during a speech Chinese <a href="core%20leader">core leader</a> <a href="Xi%20Jinping">Xi Jinping</a> gave on January 12, 2016: ["The Chinese Communist Party is always working towards strict and comprehensive governance. Party organizations at all levels need to rise together and bear the responsibilities of strict governance."]

People featured.
Each episode features multiple convictions of allegedly corrupt Chinese Communist Party officials. Over 77 officials were featured, among whom were:

Reception.
Chinese state-run media, such as "<a href="Xinhua%20News%20Agency">Xinhua</a>" and "<a href="China%20Daily">China Daily</a>", released statements of glowing praise for the program, writing it "had the power" to "make the [anti-corruption] message really hit home." The <a href="Falun%20Dafa">Falun Dafa</a> affiliated <a href="New%20Tang%20Dynasty%20Television">New Tang Dynasty Television</a>, on the other hand, questioned the CCP's motives for making the series, accused the CCP of "brainwashing" () the Chinese people, claimed that it was more about saving the image of the CCP than actually helping Chinese people, and furthermore claimed that the series ignores the fundamental reasons behind corruption in China.

"The New York Times" released a mostly positive review of the series, but lamented its that in certain aspects, especially concerning the brief mentions the highest convicted corrupt officials such as <a href="Zhou%20Yongkang">Zhou Yongkang</a> received, its "candor was limited"; further, they felt that certain elements of corruption in China, such as trading military promotions and <a href="sex%20trafficking">sex trafficking</a>, went unmentioned, while the program mainly focused on gifts of <a href="luxury%20food">luxury food</a> products such as <a href="Alligator%20meat">crocodile tail</a>. Their review also mentioned that many Chinese Communist Party officials were ordered to watch the show.

Other Western media were harsher, such as <a href="Quartz%20%28publication%29">"Quartz"</a>, which referred to the convicted officials as only "allegedly corrupt" and accused the CCP of forcing confessions to create the program.

Hansine Andræ

Hansine Pouline Andræ née Schack (1817–1898) was an early Danish <a href="feminist">feminist</a> who proposed changes to Denmark's marriage <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> for the benefit of women. Her diaries (1854–58), reflecting her opinions on politics and parliamentary debates, provide a precious historical account of the times. They were published by her son Poul Andræ in three volumes from 1914 to 1920.

Biography.
Born on 5 April 1817 in Sengeløse to the west of <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, Hansine Pouline Schack was the daughter of Nicolai Clausen Schack (1781–1844), a <a href="Provost%20%28religion%29">provost</a>, and Tagea Dorothea Erasmi (1785–1841). She was educated at Miss Zeuthen's girls boarding school until her father was appointed parish priest of Copenhagen's <a href="Church%20of%20Our%20Saviour%2C%20Copenhagen">Church of Our Saviour</a> in 1833. In 1842, she married the mathematician and politician <a href="Carl%20Christoffer%20Georg%20Andr%C3%A6">Carl Christoffer Georg Andræ</a>.

In the evenings, before going to bed, she recorded her opinions and impressions of political life in what became the diaries which were later published as "Geheimeraadinde Andræs politiske Dagbøger". These reflected her husbands contacts and discussions with liberal policians such as <a href="Andreas%20Frederik%20Krieger">Andreas Frederik Krieger</a> and <a href="Carl%20Christian%20Hall">Carl Christian Hall</a>. Her accounts also commented on the proceedings of the Danish parliament, which she frequently attended, and the comments her husband made on his political negotiations. In his book on "Kirkegaard in Golden Age Denmark", Bruce Kirmmse qualifies her as "very intelligent and politically shrewd". However, unlike her sister Marie Rovsing and her niece Tagea Johansen, she was not an open activist despite her firm feminist ideas. In 1879, she wrote to the women's rights activist <a href="Severine%20Casse">Severine Casse</a> (1805-98) in connection with a proposal from the <a href="Danish%20Women%27s%20Society">Danish Women's Society</a> to change the <a href="Church%20of%20Denmark">Church of Denmark</a>'s marriage ritual. Andræ called for a revision which would reduce the number of times a woman had to promise obedience to her husband to just one, writing: "What is the difference between having to say 'yes' once or ten times?... It seems to me that when women push for a change in the ritual, they should call for the removal of any reference to submissiveness." She did in fact live to see changes along these lines shortly before her death.

Hansine Andræ suffered a stroke in 1892 and died on 17 March 1898 in Copenhagen.

Shindig! Magazine

Shindig! is a <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> magazine that is published monthly in the United Kingdom. It has been published by Silverback Publishing since 2015. Before that it was published by Volcano Publishing from 2007.

History.
Shindig! was founded by Jon 'Mojo' Mills in 1992 and was initially published under the name Gravedigger as a photocopied <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a> that covered garage-punk music. The name <a href="Shindig%21">Shindig!</a> was adopted in 1994 to better reflect the broader content of the magazine and pay homage to the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Corporation</a> show of the same name that brought the <a href="British%20Invasion">British Invasion</a> to the USA. In 1997 Jon 'Mojo' Mills was joined by Andy Morton after Andy saw a review of a band he was in, Bronco Bullfrog, reviewed in the magazine. Up until 2002 it was published only once a year.

Adele Schulenburg Gleeson

Adele Schulenberg Gleeson (1883-1971) was an American sculptor active in Missouri and Connecticut.

Early life.
Adele E. Schulenburg was born on January 18, 1883, in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, the daughter of August Wilhelm Schulenburg (1843-1916) and Adele Mallinckrodt (1851-1937). She had two sisters, Eleanor Schulenburg Bausch (1872-1955) and Agnes M. Schulenburg Schaberg (1874-1951), and one brother, Gustavus Otto Schulenburg (1878-1951). Her maternal grandfather was Emil Mallinckrodt (1806-1892), a prolific writer whose sons, Gustave, Eduard and Otto, founded <a href="Mallinckrodt">G. Mallinckrodt Chemical</a>, St. Louis, in 1867.

Adele Schulenburg, together with her friend <a href="Nancy%20Coonsman">Nancy Coonsman</a> studied under <a href="George%20Julian%20Zolnay">George Julian Zolnay</a>. After finishing a four-year course in the School of Fine Arts of <a href="Washington%20University%20in%20St.%20Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a>, Schulenburg opened a studio in St. Louis for one year. After the St. Louis School of Fine Arts, Schulenberg studied in Philadelphia with <a href="Charles%20Grafly">Charles Grafly</a>.

Schulenberg and Coonsman went abroad to study sculpture in the secessionist private school of Arthur Wilhelm Otto Lewin-Funcke, of Berlin. There Schulenberg remained for one year and a half, touring Germany, Paris, Dresden, Munich, Italy and other places at the end of her studies before returning home.

Career.
Coming home from Europe, Adele Schulenburg opened a studio on Grand Avenue and Morgan Street, St. Louis, and Coonsman worked with her in the same studio, although each filled her own commissions and had her individual line of work.

Schulenberg made portraits, sketches, reliefs, statuettes, busts, fountains and architectural designs. She specialized in "vigorous" bas reliefs for St. Louis and New York City buildings. She did a portrait of Eduard Mallinckrodt, "a fine breathing likeness", and a group of the Rombauer children, "lifelike and clear". The "Incense Burner" was one of her best pieces and many copies of this had been made in bronze and terra cotta.


Personal life.
Adele Schulenburg lived, among other places, in St. Louis, Missouri (3213 Russell Avenue and 4518 Cote Brilliant Avenue), <a href="Kirkwood%2C%20Missouri">Kirkwood, Missouri</a> (115 Edwin Avenue), <a href="East%20Haddam%2C%20Connecticut">East Haddam, Connecticut</a> and <a href="Colchester%2C%20Connecticut">Colchester, Connecticut</a>.

On October 31, 1914, Schulenburg married Charles K. Gleeson, another artist. Charles Gleeson was born in St. Louis on March 5, 1878, the son of John Gleeson and Rose Mullen. He studied at the St. Louis School of Fine Arts from 1904 to 1907, at the <a href="Art%20Students%20League%20of%20New%20York">Art Students League of New York</a> in 1908, and at the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20Colarossi">Académie Colarossi</a> and the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20de%20la%20Grande%20Chaumi%C3%A8re">Académie de la Grande Chaumière</a> in Paris from 1909 to 1910. In both years he exhibited etchings at the Paris Salon. He then became the Art instructor at the <a href="Central%20High%20School">Central High School</a> in St. Louis. They had two children: Rosamund Elsbeth and Karl Kinsheleah.

Schulenburg died in 1971 at <a href="Briarcliff%20Manor%2C%20New%20York">Briarcliff Manor, New York</a>.

Ceinture 51 to 65

Ceinture 51 to 65 were a class of fifteen 4-6-0T locomotives built in 1902 for the "Syndicat d'Exploitation des Chemins de fer de Ceinture de Paris". They passed to the <a href="Chemins%20de%20fer%20du%20Nord">Chemins de fer du Nord</a> in 1934 who renumbered them 3.701 to 3.715. In 1938 they passed to the <a href="SNCF">SNCF</a> who renumbered them 230.TA.1 to 230.TA.6. 

History.
The <a href="chief%20mechanical%20engineer">chief mechanical engineer</a> of the Nord <a href="Gaston%20du%20Bousquet">Gaston du Bousquet</a> designed a series of fifteen <a href="push-pull">push-pull</a><a href="%20tank%20locomotives"> tank locomotives</a> for the Ceinture that were capable of rapid acceleration due to the frequent stops.  The first batch of locomotives were built by the Nord's <a href="Hellemmes-Lille">Hellemmes</a> workshops; they were followed by a second batch built by the Nord's La Chapelle workshops. They entered service on the 1 April 1903.

In 1934 at the dissolution of the "Syndicat", the Nord renumbered them 3.701 to 3.715.

In 1936, the Nord rebuilt 3.702 (ex Ceinture 52) with a larger rear bunker and a trailing axle, making it a <a href="4-6-2T">4-6-2T</a>. The Nord did not renumber it, as their numbering system only encoded the number of driving axles. The SNCF initially failed to notice that the locomotive was different from its sisters, and initially renumbered it 230.TA.1; when the error was spotted it was renumbered 231.TA.1..

Also in 1936 four locomotives were scrapped, and two were sold the (GCL). Three more were sold the following year leaving just six to enter service with the SNCF in 1938; however two of these were sold in April 1939 without receiving their SNCF number. The remaining four were scrapped between 1939 and 1947. 

The CGL used their locomotives on the and lines. The last CGL locomotive to be scrapped was the former Nord 3.713 (née Ceinture 63) which was scrapped at Bapaume in 1960.

Description.
The boiler was based on that used on the "Revolvers" (<a href="Nord%202.231%20to%202.305">Nord 2.231 to 2.305</a> series) and had a <a href="Belpaire%20firebox">Belpaire firebox</a>. The dome was mounted on the first ring, and a sandbox was mounted on the second. 

The locomotives were four-cylinder tandem compounds: the rear high pressure cylinders were mounted on the same piston rod as the front low pressure ones.

GolemLabs Studios Inc is a French-Canadian computer games developer based in the town of <a href="Sherbrooke">Sherbrooke</a>, <a href="Qu%C3%A9bec">Québec</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and was founded in 2000. According to the founders, "GolemLabs was born out of our desire to never get bored at work. Almost 15 years later, much to the dismay of our spouses and our accountants, the desire is still going strong. And why not? With its mission of producing intelligent and one of a kind video games, the company helps filling the increasing need for novelty and originality in the industry." 

The company's first developed title, <a href="SuperPower">"SuperPower"</a>, was published by DreamCatcher Interactive on March 27, 2002. The sequel, <a href="SuperPower%202">"SuperPower 2"</a>, was published by DreamCatcher Interactive in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> on October 11, 2004 and in the <a href="EU">EU</a> on November 19, 2004. 

Two different remastered versions of "SuperPower 2" were finally released with <a href="THQ%20Nordic%23Nordic%20Games%20GmbH%20%282011%E2%80%932016%29">Nordic Games</a> as publisher: "SuperPower 2 Steam Edition", released on Steam on April 18, 2014, and an unnamed version on <a href="Good%20Old%20Games">Good Old Games</a>/<a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a> on August 13, 2015. 

With GolemLabs as development company, <a href="THQ%20Nordic">THQ Nordic</a> has scheduled <a href="The%20Guild%203">The Guild 3</a> for release in the second half of 2017.

Company history.
Years of turmoil followed the release of SuperPower 2, with the <a href="Financial%20Crisis">Financial Crisis</a> and the <a href="Great%20Recession">Great Recession</a> soon "looming" over the market at large. Ironically for GolemLabs, this famous Depression-times styled wording, used in SuperPower 2, soon hit the company itself. Forbes explained the everyday situation in 2012 like this: 
Akin to this deep <a href="macroeconomic">macroeconomic</a> SuperPower 2 study, we find that: <a href="https%3A//www.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Erwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/h/Herbert_Hoover.htm">Hard Times Are Still Hoover-ing Over Us</a> at "<a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>", <a href="Hooverville">Hooverville</a>.

During the <a href="Financial%20Crisis">Financial Crisis</a> and the following <a href="Great%20Recession">Great Recession</a>, both customers and investors for the gaming industry faced difficult times, spending was low, frugality was encouraged, resulting in investments and sales both drying up also for the gaming industry. An example of this is <a href="Obsidian%20Entertainment">Obsidian Entertainment</a>'s history with the <a href="THQ">old THQ</a>, the publisher caused by the publisher's own commercial failures: <a href="THQ%23Reorganization%2C%20financial%20struggles%20%282010%E2%80%932012%29">The old THQ's Reorganization, financial struggles (2010–2012)</a> & <a href="THQ%23Bankruptcy%20and%20liquidation%2C%20THQ%20Nordic%20%282012%E2%80%93present%29">the old THQ's Bankruptcy and liquidation, THQ Nordic (2012–present)</a>. 

At the same time, <a href="JoWooD%20Entertainment">JoWooD Entertainment</a>, publisher of <a href="The%20Guild%202">The Guild Series</a>, went into administration. They had received <a href="Metascore">Metascore</a> ranging from mediocre to below average (The Guild 2 <a href="http%3A//www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-guild-2-venice">Venice flagged red, 49%</a>) for their niche games and were bogged down by a lawsuit filed by JoWooD against Koch Media GmbH for €2.36 million ($3.06 million) plus interest. This caused their newly acquired subsidiary <a href="Dreamcatcher%20Interactive">Dreamcatcher Interactive</a>, GolemLabs' publisher for SuperPower 1 & 2, to file for bankruptcy. Then <a href="THQ%20Nordic%23Nordic%20Games%20GmbH%20%282011%E2%80%932016%29">Nordic Games</a> (2011–2016) <a href="THQ_Nordic%23Properties_acquired">acquired the rights & labels</a> from JoWood and Dreamcatcher. 

So a decade after GolemLabs' last published title, two different remastered versions of "SuperPower 2" were finally released with <a href="THQ%20Nordic%23Nordic%20Games%20GmbH%20%282011%E2%80%932016%29">Nordic Games</a> as publisher: "SuperPower 2 Steam Edition", released on Steam on April 18, 2014, and an unnamed version on <a href="Good%20Old%20Games">Good Old Games</a>/<a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a> on August 13, 2015. 

Since then, <a href="Lars%20Wingefors">Lars Wingefors</a>' company (Swedish entrepreneur, Nordic Games) as the new owners of the rights for <a href="The%20Guild%202">The Guild series</a>, "was able to hire the Canadian developer GolemLabs in 2014", (2013 according to insider sources) "for the sequel of the popular The Guild series. Extensive work has since 2013 been done on <a href="The%20Guild%203">"The Guild 3"</a> with GolemLabs as developer, and with <a href="Heinrich%20Meyer">Heinrich Meyer</a>, one of the designers and authors of the first two The Guild games as producer. <a href="THQ%20Nordic">THQ Nordic</a>, "has been passionately committed on supporting and expanding the "Guild" games." This partnership with GolemLabs, who has a long experience in strategy games, combines the creative talents of both companies to expand on the potential of this beloved franchise."

Vienna, Austria, August 12, 2016: Nordic Games had acquired the rights to the THQ brand name, and reincorporated & renamed itself with a fusioned name: <a href="THQ%20Nordic">THQ Nordic</a>, and went public with its own listing on the stock exchange. This ment even better times for GolemLabs, if successful. Swedish press instantly labeled <a href="Lars%20Wingefors">Lars Wingefors</a> as a "Super Entrepreneur" and "billionaire", hailing the move as a great commercial success. Sweden, being the land of <a href="Ingvar%20Kamprad">Ingvar Kamprad</a>, the man behind <a href="IKEA">IKEA</a>. 

By this time, The Guild 3 community had long since made it clear that: 
There is a connection between <a href="game%20quality">game quality</a>, <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>s and <a href="earnings">earnings</a>. The new funding (finances) and therefore prospects were better after THQ Nordic took over. This spells better time & funding for GolemLabs as developer, a better game delivered for the gaming community, better reviews from the press & better Metacritics, better earnings for the owners, shareholders & the market; a classical <a href="win-win%20situation">win-win situation</a>. 

<a href="The%20Guild%203">The Guild 3</a> will act as a change of platform, superceeding <a href="The%20Guild%202">The Guild 2</a> as a new, more modern, up-to-date & better platform for expansive content, user generated content and modding for another decade or more. This is similar to the role e.g. each new generation of the game engine <a href="Source_%28game_engine%29">Source</a> plays in the <a href="Half-Life">Half-Life</a>, <a href="Steam">Steam</a> world and ecosystem, or <a href="Unreal%20Engine">Unreal Engine</a> , now roughly representing each new <a href="console%20generation">console generation</a>.

<a href="THQ%20Nordic">THQ Nordic</a> has scheduled <a href="The%20Guild%203">The Guild 3</a> for release in the second half of 2017. In 2015, an <a href="alpha">alpha</a> version of the game was shown to the public at <a href="Gamescom">Gamescom</a>, according to German PC Games, relaying footage from <a href="THQ%20Nordic">THQ Nordic</a> & GolemLabs' room there. As of August 2017, the company was in the last stages of development.

<doc id="54767991" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54767991" title="General State Administration">
General State Administration

The General State Administration is one of the <a href="Public%20Administration%20of%20Spain">Public Administrations of Spain</a>. It is the only administration with powers throughout the <a href="Spain">national territory</a> and is controlled by the <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">central government</a>.

It is integrated by:

Its legal regime is set out in article 103 of the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201978">Spanish Constitution of 1978</a> and Law 6/1997 of April 14, about Organization and Functioning of the General State Administration, which establishes that the General State Administration, under the direction of the <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Government</a> and with full submission to the Law, objectively serves the general interests, developing executive functions of an administrative nature. On October 1, 2016, the Law 6/1997 was repealed upon the entry into force of Law 40/2015.

Structure.
Central Organization.
Ministers.
The <a href="Minister%20%28government%29">Ministers</a> are the holders of a <a href="Ministry%20%28government%20department%29">Ministry</a>, being the hierarchically superior head of the branch in question. They perform the function of axis between their respective ministerial department and the own organ of <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Government</a>, of which they are part. In this way, they are the head of a certain sector of the administrative apparatus, and at the same time, they are the base element of an organ of political character, as it is the own Government.

They are named and separated by the <a href="King%20of%20Spain">King of Spain</a> on the proposal of the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Government%20of%20Spain">President of the Government of Spain</a>. In the event that the President himself ceases, his ministers will leave the post together with him, something completely logical given that the bond of trust between the <a href="Cortes%20Generales">legislative branch</a> and the executive branch occurs through the figure of the President of the Government, in this way, it is logical that if such a link is broken, all the components of the executive fall with him. Along the same lines, the President will be in charge of determining the number and competencies of the Ministries.

Regarding the functions of the Minister, it should be noted that they can be divided between those that he serves as a member of the <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Government</a>, and those he performs as a Minister. Regarding this second aspect, it should be noted that there is an immense variety of functions that the Minister plays in his role of head and director of the corresponding Ministerial Department. The Law about Organization and Functioning of the General State Administration makes an exhaustive enumeration of functions, among which the ones related to the appointment and separation of the governing bodies of the Ministry, the determination of their internal organizational structure, <a href="human%20resources">human resources</a> management, issues Economic and budgetary aspects of its Department, and to end representative functions, in a political (relations with the <a href="Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">Autonomous Communities</a>, etc.) and legal (acting on behalf of the legal entity of the State and imputation of its acts) sense.

Finally, it should be pointed out the office of non-suitcase minister, an infrequent position and intimately linked to the person appointed for it, who does not hold the title of any Ministry, but whose presence in the <a href="Council%20of%20ministers%20of%20spain">Council of Ministers</a> is necessary, either because he is a figure of trust for the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Spain">President</a>, or because it is a government fruit of an alliance between different parties, and for that reason, has to go to this position as a way for the minority party to accede to the <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Government</a>.

Secretaries of State.
The Secretariats of State are departmental superior organs of management and sectorial management that occupy the superior level in the hierarchy of intermediate commands between the Minister and the official apparatus, above the General Director and of the General Secretary. When it is a position of strict political trust, his appointment is free, as is his removal. It should be noted that, contrary to what happens with the Ministers, the Secretaries of State do not fall with the President if he ceases. The Secretary of State is what is known in the <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20world">Anglo-Saxon world</a> as <a href="Deputy%20Minister">Deputy Minister</a> or Deputy Secretary (<a href="United%20States">United States</a>).

Law 6/1997, about Organization and Functioning of the General State Administration states in article 9.1 the eventual character of the body, calling it a "higher body", as it does with the Ministers. Such status implies a different treatment in terms of the personal requirements to be fulfilled by the holder, which in this case supposes a total absence of restrictions, giving total freedom to the <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Government</a> and the Minister to choose the person they consider convenient.

They are in charge of appointing and separating the General Directors, as well as directing and coordinating the General Directorates under the Secretariat of State concerned. Likewise, the Secretary of State shall assume those functions that the Minister delegates thereto, as indicated in Article 7.2 of the Government Law.

Undersecretaries.
Law 6/1997 qualifies it as a governing body, whose holder must be a career official of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local Entities, in addition to having the status of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent. This is a high position of political trust, appointed by the <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Government</a> on the proposal of the Minister concerned, and whose dismissal is equally free.

Since the creation of the office in 1834, its functions have evolved from the original supervision of the instruction of the administrative records to the contemporary headquarters of the general and instrumental services of the Department. Their current functions are:

General Directors.
The General Directorates are management departmental bodies and steering bodies, hierarchically inferior to Secretaries of State and Secretaries General. The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent. It should be noted that the Royal Decree on the structure of the Department may omit the first requirement because it is a General Directorate whose exceptional characteristics require that the holder does not have the status of official of the State.

With respect to their functions, as indicated in Article 18 of Law 6/1997, the General Director will be in touch with the bureaucratic apparatus of the State, acting as a manager of a determinated area. It will be the one who proposes the projects referred to its corresponding sector, and also, will be in charge of directing and supervising their execution, all with a view to achieving the objectives that have been established by the Minister. Likewise, it will exercise the specific powers delegated to it, or those that will be awarded to it under the pertinent rules.

On the other hand, the Director General, as a consequence of his position of supremacy within the General Directorate, will be in charge of monitoring the proper functioning of the entire bureaucratic complex that depends on him. Likewise, it will be in charge of issuing the corresponding information to the General Direction, for its departmental superiors.

Technical General Secretaries.
They are the technical organs of the Ministry, with the rank of General Director. They are under the immediate dependence of the Undersecretary.
Their functions are:

Cabinets.
They are consultation bodies generally composed of a technical secretary and several technicians who support the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Government%20%28Spain%29">President</a>, <a href="Vicepresident%20of%20the%20Government%20of%20Spain">Vicepresident</a>, Ministers, Secretaries of State, ect. in their relations with institutions, in making decisions and performing special advisory tasks in a particular branch of knowledge.

Peripheral Organization.
The Peripheral State Administration is an Administration dependent on the General State Administration that, through organs dependent on it, assure the presence of the General State Administration throughout the <a href="Spain">national territory</a>. It acts, therefore, as an extension of <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">government</a> and administration. 

The structure of the Peripheral Administration varies according to the <a href="Autonomous%20Communities">Autonomous Communities</a>, because in the majority of them there are Delegations and Subdelegations with the exception of the single-<a href="Provinces%20of%20Spain">province</a> Autonomous Communities, that do not have Subdelegations, since the competences of these are taken by the Delegations itself (the <a href="Autonomous%20Community%20of%20Madrid">Autonomous Community of Madrid</a> is a single-province autonomous community that due to its status of <a href="Capital%20of%20Spain">Capital</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Spain">Kingdom</a> and his population size, has Delegations and Subdelegations). In the islands, there exists the Island Director.

Delegations of the Government.
The Delegations of the Government in the <a href="Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">Autonomous communities</a> are administrative bodies whose head is a high position appointed in the discretion of the <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Government</a>, responding before the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Presidency%20%28Spain%29">Ministry of Public Administration</a>. Has Undersecretary rank. He is in charge of the management of the State Administration in the territory of a certain <a href="Autonomous%20community%20of%20Spain">Autonomous Community</a>. In addition, it assumes the former sanctioning powers of the Civil Governor, directs integrated territorial services and appoints the Subdelegate of the Government, which is the figure that properly replaces that of civilian governors.

Subdelegations of the Government.
The Subdelegations of the Government in the <a href="Provinces%20of%20Spain">Provinces</a> are organs of the Delegations of the Government that carry out the functions that the Delegate asigned them and represents the <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Government</a> in the Provinces. In the single-province Autonomous Communities, its powers are assumed by the Government Delegate.

The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent
Insular Directors.
In the islands of <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a>, <a href="Ibiza%20%28island%29">Ibiza</a>, <a href="Formentera">Formentera</a>, <a href="Lanzarote">Lanzarote</a>, <a href="Fuerteventura">Fuerteventura</a>, <a href="La%20Palma">La Palma</a>, <a href="El%20Hierro">El Hierro</a> and <a href="La%20Gomera">La Gomera</a>, there will be an Insular Director of the General State Administration. It will depend hierarchically on the Delegate of the Government or the Subdelegate, when this position exists.

The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, <a href="Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">Autonomous Communities</a> or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent.

State Administration Abroad.
It is integrated by:

Delegations.
The delegations represent the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Spain">Kingdom of Spain</a> in a body of an <a href="international%20organization">international organization</a>, in a Conference of States convened by or under the auspices of an international organization, or in a concrete act organized by a third State for which a delegation is required to form a delegation official.

Institutions and public bodies.
In this section, public bodies, state companies, public foundations and consortium entities and any other related entities or dependents of the Public Administrations that act abroad.

Special Diplomatic Missions.
The Special Diplomatic Missions temporarily represent the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Spain">Kingdom of Spain</a> to one or more States, with their consent, for a specific purpose, or to one or more States where there is no permanent Diplomatic Mission or to all States for a special purpose .

Consular Offices.
The Consular Offices are the organs of the General State Administration in charge of the exercise of consular functions and especially of providing assistance and protection to <a href="Spaniards">Spaniards</a> abroad. The Consular Offices shall exercise the functions attributed to them by the current regulations, <a href="International%20Law">International Law</a> and international treaties to which <a href="Spain">Spain</a> is a party.

Representations or Permanent Missions.
The Permanent Diplomatic Missions represent the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Spain">Kingdom of Spain</a> before one or more States with which it has established diplomatic relations. When a Mission represents Spain before several States it will do it in multiple accreditation system and with residence in one of them.

The Permanent Representations represent the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Spain">Kingdom of Spain</a> before the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> or an <a href="International%20Organization">International Organization</a>.

The 2017–18 <a href="Liga%20MX%20Femenil">Liga MX Femenil</a> season is the inaugural season of the top-flight women's football league in Mexico. The season consists of female representatives of sixteen <a href="Liga%20MX">Liga MX</a> teams. The Apertura season started on July 29, 2017 and will end in November 2017. The season is split into two championships—the <a href="%23Torneo%20Apertura">Torneo Apertura</a> and the <a href="%23Torneo%20Clausura">Torneo Clausura</a>—each in an identical format and each contested by the same sixteen teams.

Only players born in Mexico are allowed to participate. This rule raises controversy since the foreign-born Mexican players (mostly born in the United States) who already represented the country's national team are not exempt. <a href="Ver%C3%B3nica%20P%C3%A9rez">Verónica Pérez</a>, who capped 89 times for Mexico at senior level, was avoided from competing in the league, alongside with Jazmín Aguas and former Mexico U-20 national team member Olivia Jiménez. Subsequently, Pérez has criticized the rule publicly and retired from football.

Teams, stadiums, and personnel.
The following sixteen teams are competing this season. <a href="Puebla%20F.C.">Puebla</a> and <a href="Lobos%20BUAP">Lobos BUAP</a> are the two teams who will not field a women's team. As of August 18, 2017 thirteen teams are using the <a href="Liga%20MX">men's</a> team's stadium.

Format.
The teams will be divided into two groups of eight, where the best two of each group will advance to the semifinals of the <a href="%23Liguilla">Liguilla</a>.

Torneo Apertura.

<doc id="54768198" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54768198" title="Terrorism and tourism in Egypt">
Terrorism and tourism in Egypt

Terrorism and tourism in Egypt is when terrorist attacks are specifically aimed at Egypt's tourists. These attacks often end in fatalities and injuries and has an immediate and sometimes lasting effect on the industry. Examples are the blowing up airplanes full of tourists, drive-by shootings of tourists, knife attacks on tourists and suicide explosions in a location where tourists are congregated. In the timeline of these events, the 1997 <a href="Luxor%20massacre">Luxor Massacre</a> when 62 tourists were ambushed and killed is a prime example. These types of attacks carried out by different extremists, over the years, hurt <a href="Economy%20of%20Egypt">Egypt's economy</a> by damaging one of its most important economic sectors, <a href="Tourism%20in%20Egypt">tourism</a>. 

So while there is a history of persecution and terrorism aimed at <a href="Persecution%20of%20Copts">Egypt's Coptic Christians</a>, such as the <a href="Palm%20Sunday%20church%20bombings">Palm Sunday church bombings</a> in 2016, and there has been terrorism directed at Egypt's <a href="Terrorism%20in%20Egypt">security and government officials</a>, "terrorism targeting tourists" affects the citizens of other countries and Egypt's economy. Tourism agencies notice that when an attack on tourists occurs, potential tourists decide to visit other exotic countries like China, India or Morocco, instead.

Background.
The Egyptian tourism industry is one of the most important sectors of Egypt's economy, in terms of employment and foreign currency, and at times it has been as much as 1% of the world tourism market. The many constituents of tourism include historical attractions, especially in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, <a href="Luxor">Luxor</a> and <a href="Aswan">Aswan</a>, but also beach and other sea activities, with foreign tourism actively encouraged since it is a major source of currency and investment. Political instability since January 2011 caused fluctuations in tourism income. 

Around 1992, the new tactic of attacking tourists was noted by then <a href="President%20Mubarak">President Mubarak</a> who addressed the parliament on the grave effects these growing number of attacks by <a href="Muslim%20fundamentalist">Muslim fundamentalist</a> could have on Egypt's $2 billion tourism industry. Heightened security involved having to hire armed security guards to escort tour buses. 

The connection between terrorism and tourism has been widely studied since the <a href="Luxor%20massacre">Luxor massacre</a> in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> in 1997. The amount of news coverage a disaster gets and its effects on the tourism industry of that country has been studied by experts like Dr. Gabby Walters from the <a href="University%20of%20Queensland">University of Queensland</a>, Australia. Her predecessors at the university wrote the book "Tourism in Turbulent Times". 

Egypt's tourism industry was depressed from the <a href="Arab%20Spring">Arab Spring</a> and through the 
<a href="Egyptian%20revolution%20of%202011">Egyptian revolution of 2011</a> and through the <a href="Egyptian%20crisis%20%282011%E2%80%9314%29">Egyptian crisis (2011–14)</a>. According to the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Tourism%20%28Egypt%29">Egyptian Ministry of Tourism</a>, the number of tourists in the first quarter of 2017 had increased by almost 50% compared to the 1st quarter of 2016, but with hotel occupancy rates still only reaching 30% by 15 July 2017.

The <a href="Egyptian%20Pyramids">Egyptian Pyramids</a> attract millions of visitors each year and tourists also visit places in <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>, the Egyptian museums, <a href="Coptic%20Cairo">Coptic Cairo</a>, ancient monasteries, <a href="Mount%20Sinai">Mount Sinai</a>, the <a href="Red%20Sea%20Riviera">Red Sea Riviera</a>, places with Islamic culture and <a href="Islamic%20art">Islamic art</a>, and other places. Attacks cause countries to issue travel advisories, on steps to take for safety or countries issue <a href="Travel%20warning">travel warnings</a>, asking tourists to avoid all but necessary travel to Egypt. As of August 2017 Canada had several travel warnings on Egypt but pointed out that the Sharm El Sheikh resort area was excluded from the warning. 

The <a href="Grand%20Egyptian%20Museum">Grand Egyptian Museum</a> is a multi-million dollar museum, which is being built with help from Japan and France, slated to partially open in 2018, is a more recent investment into <a href="Tourism%20in%20Egypt">Egypt's Tourism Industry</a>, and will require extensive security.

The <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Egyptian%20Civilization">National Museum of Egyptian Civilization</a>, located in <a href="Fustat">Al-Fustat</a> made a soft opening in February. The museum features state-of-the-art security.

Notable incidents and effects.
Researchers studying terrorism and tourism said that "Random acts of terrorism curtail travel activity until the public's memories of the publicized incidents fade. Persistent terrorism, however, can tarnish a destination's image of safety and attractiveness and jeopardize its entire tourism industry."

Pyramids of Giza.
On 29 March 1993, <a href="al-Jama%27a%20al-Islamiyya">al-Jama`a al-Islamiya</a>, caused an explosion at <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Chephren">Pyramid of Chephren</a>. On 8 June 1993, a bomb lobbed at a tour bus in Giza's Pyramid Rock, killed foreign tourists and Egyptians. In late 1993, American and French tourists were shot dead at the <a href="Semiramis%20Hotel">Semiramis Hotel</a> in Cairo. 

In 1996, 18 Greek tourists who had finished touring Jerusalem and were in Egypt, near the Europa Hotel in Cairo, were killed and security nearby were not prepared (armed) to protect them.

Upper Egypt.
62 people, mostly tourists, were killed and 26 were injured during the Luxor massacre on 17 November 1997. The weapons of choice were firearms and knives.
Hotels eliminated "70% of their workforce" and "...European and Japanese tourism companies canceled their tours to Egypt" after the attack.

In 2014 an Egyptian citizen from Upper Egypt lamented about what was happening with tourism in the area with: "provided one of the most important sources of income besides farming has dried out".

On the Sinai Peninsula.
The <a href="Red%20Sea%20Riviera">Red Sea Riviera</a>, Egypt's eastern coastline along the Red Sea, is a popular destination spot. 

Results were inconclusive on the crash of 3 January 2004, <a href="Flash%20Airlines%20Flight%20604">Flash Airlines Flight 604</a> carrying mostly French tourists. It had left <a href="Sharm%20El%20Sheikh%20International%20Airport">Sharm El Sheikh International Airport</a>, with 148 people on board and all died as a result of the crash. 

In 2004, tourism from Israel all but stopped after three incidents. Before 2004, "400,000 Israelis visited the peninsula each year. Over a decade later, the number is a trickle." 

On 2 May 2014, a bomb on a tour bus in Sharm El Sheikh detonated, killing one and injuring four others.

Reuters reported that Sinai's militants had turned their attention from security forces to tourists or "softer targets". The explosion was caught on camera when on 16 February 2014, four civilians including three South Korean tourists were killed in what is known as the <a href="2014%20Taba%20bus%20bombing">2014 Taba bus bombing</a>. The bomber detonated his device on a tour bus carrying more than 30 members of a South Korean church group. They had traveled from <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> to <a href="Saint%20Catherine%27s%20Monastery">Saint Catherine's Monastery</a> in the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a>. The bus was waiting to cross into Israel when the explosion occurred. The South Korean tourists belonged to the Jincheon Jungang Presbyterian Church. They had reportedly "saved for years to visit Biblical sites on the 60th anniversary of their church". After this attack, Britons were warned not to travel to South Sinai, with an official government travel warning.

By 2015, conditions had deteriorated to the point where Israeli tourists stopped going to the area for 18 months then resumed their visits, under heavy security in 2017.

When tourism was fledgling after the Egyptian crisis from 2011-2014, the <a href="Metrojet%20Flight%209268">downing of an airplane which left Sharm El Sheikh airport with Russian tourists</a> on 31 October 2015, sent shock waves through the industry again. The cause was suspected to be a bomb and speculation largely fell on an airport worker. Russia stopped all flights to Sharm-El-Sheik, until Russian officials inspected the airport and felt it met better security standards. After the downing of the jet, "scared tourists" left the area, affecting the Bedouin population who worked in the tourism industry. Russian and Britain stopped all flights to Sharm El Sheikh.

On 19 May 2016, <a href="EgyptAir%20Flight%20804">EgyptAir Flight 804</a>, left Paris for Cairo, with 66 people on board but never made it. 

In <a href="2016%20Hurghada%20attack">2016 tourists were attacked in Hurghada</a> and again <a href="2017%20Hurghada%20attack">in 2017</a>, when a German who had been radicalized stabbed several tourists at the resort area.

Whether targeting Egypt's Coptic Christians, tourists or both, an attack on 18 April 2017 near St. Catherine's Monastery, leaving a number of police officers injured came at a critical time, when Egypt was anxiously awaiting a decision on whether flights from Russia would resume. Even before the attack, Israel had asked its citizens not to go into the Sinai Peninsula.

The Southwest of Egypt.
Sometimes the attacks happen for ransom money and not necessarily to immediately take the lives of tourists. On 19 September 2008, men in masks took tourists hostage into the <a href="Western%20Desert%20%28Egypt%29">Western desert</a> and demanded ransom money. After ten days a rescue operation resulted in the successful rescue of all the hostages and in the killing of one of the abductors.

The Spiritual Hunt

The Spiritual Hunt () is a <a href="prose%20poem">prose poem</a> purportedly written by French writer <a href="Arthur%20Rimbaud">Arthur Rimbaud</a>, claimed to be his <a href="masterpiece">masterpiece</a> by his friend and lover <a href="Paul%20Verlaine">Paul Verlaine</a>. Supposedly strongly resembling in form the only book he published during his lifetime, "<a href="A%20Season%20in%20Hell">A Season in Hell</a>", the poem is considered to be one of the most famous <a href="lost%20work">lost artworks</a>, even though in 1949, a twelve-page work by the same title was unveiled to the public by <a href="Pascal%20Pia">Pascal Pia</a>; Rimbaud scholars, almost unanimously, have denounced this poem as a <a href="literary%20forgery">literary forgery</a>.

The poem.
The poem was first mentioned by Paul Verlaine, who claimed to have forgotten its manuscript back with his wife Mathilde in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, after leaving the capital for <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> to reunite with Rimbaud in July 1873. Since it was around this time that Mathilde discovered Rimbaud's "obscene and sexual letters" to Verlaine, <a href="Jacques%20Bienvenu">Jacques Bienvenu</a> has tried to demonstrate that Verlaine may have even invented the existence of the poem, wanting to subsequently present Rimbaud's letters as a work of <a href="fiction">fiction</a>. Even though <a href="Edmund%20White">Edmund White</a> believes that the poem had, in fact, existed and that Mathilde destroyed it along with the letters – but not before using them to win her lawsuit for separation from Verlaine in 1874 – he notes that "[i]n his overvaluation of this lost text, Verlaine seems clearly to have been what we might now call a drama queen; he couldn't remember a single line from it later, or even its title."

The forgery.
Almost sixty years after Rimbaud's death, on May 19, 1949, <a href="Pascal%20Pia">Pascal Pia</a> – who by that time had already published three authentic texts by Rimbaud (but who was also known as a forger of <a href="Guillaume%20Apollinaire">Apollinaire</a>, <a href="Charles%20Baudelaire">Baudelaire</a> and <a href="Raymond%20Radiguet">Radiguet</a>) – to the amazement of the French literary scene, presented for the first time the supposed text of "The Spiritual Hunt"; extracts of the poem appeared in the newspaper "Combat" before the integral poem was published few days later by "<a href="Mercure%20de%20France">Mercure de France</a>". However, in a long essay titled "Flagrant crime" and published in "Le Figaro" in July 1949, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breton">André Breton</a> exposed the work as a forgery, and pointed <a href="Akakia%20Viala">Akakia Viala</a>, a theatre director, and <a href="Nicolas%20Bataille">Nicolas Bataille</a>, an actor, as the authors of the fake.

Both Viala and Bataille admitted the crime, claiming that the text had been intended as a revenge on the Rimbaldians who had savagely criticized their recent staging of "A Season in Hell" and that it had been published without their knowledge. According to Breton and <a href="Benjamin%20P%C3%A9ret">Benjamin Péret</a>, under the seal of secrecy, but hoping to make the text known in the underground literary circles, Bataille had entrusted the poem to Maurice Billot, a <a href="bookseller">bookseller</a> and a close friend of <a href="Maurice%20Nadeau">Maurice Nadeau</a>, <a href="Pascal%20Pia">Pascal Pia</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Saillet">Maurice Saillet</a>; Billot, in turn, gave the poem to Saillet, demanding utmost discretion. Nevertheless, Saillet handed it to <a href="Pascal%20Pia">Pascal Pia</a> and very soon they offered the text to "Mercure de France"; Saillet prepared the poem for printing, and Pia authored a long introduction; the book was published in a limited print run of 60 copies. After Breton's pamphlet, the text was republished as a Rimbaldian <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a>, but the press had turned the affair into a huge international scandal, out of which <a href="Maurice%20Nadeau">Nadeau</a> never recovered, and "whose repercussions are hard to imagine today".

However, on December 5, 2012, a reissue of the poem by Bataille and Viala was published by <a href="L%C3%A9o%20Scheer">Léo Scheer</a> under the name of "Arthur Rimbaud" followed by a 400-page postface by <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Lefr%C3%A8re">Jean-Jacques Lefrère</a>, which concludes that there may be "<a href="reasonable%20doubt">no definite facts to assert that the text is or is not a work of Rimbaud</a>". On December 13, 2016, philologist Ahmadou Empaté Bâ published an article in "Les Mots et les Lettres" questioning Lefrère's method, mainly by demonstrating that the distinction between <a href="poet">poet</a>s and <a href="poetaster">poetaster</a>s is not as obvious as one may be led to believe by his reasoning.

Yves de La Brière

Yves de La Brière (30 January 1877 – 25 February 1941) was an influential French <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> theologian and author. He was a monarchist and supported the League of Nations. 
He was opposed to war, but wrote on the Christian tradition of just war.
He was involved in the controversy in 1926 over the relationship between the Catholic church and the Catholic monarchist <a href="Action%20Fran%C3%A7aise">Action Française</a>, which the Pope refused to support. 

Life.
Yves Le Roy de La Brière was born in <a href="Vif%2C%20Is%C3%A8re">Vif, Isère</a>, on 30 January 1877.
His father was a life-long extreme monarchist.
La Brière joined the Jesuits in 1894.
He gained a Bachelor of Arts, History and Law.
It 1909, when the review "Les Etudes" changed its format and contributors, he was asked by the editor-in-chief Father Léonce de Grandmaison to write a regular column that would be political, religious and international.
He contributed to "Les Études" from 1909 to 1941.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–18) La Brière actively supported the efforts by <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XV">Pope Benedict XV</a> to negotiate a compromise peace.
After the war he became professor of Christian principles of international law at the <a href="Institut%20Catholique%20de%20Paris">Institut Catholique de Paris</a>, where he was a strong supporter of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> and of international peace.
Despite this, La Brière was attacked by <a href="Julien%20Benda">Julien Benda</a> in "La Trahison des clercs" (1927) due to his willingness to allow that there could be some moral justification for war..
In 1930 he wrote on the subject in an article titled "La conception de la paix et de la guerre chez Saint Augustin" in the "Revue de philosophie".
La Brière's "Le droit de juste guerre" (1938) discussed the Christian tradition of <a href="Just%20war%20theory">just war</a> based on the writings of Augustine.

In the autumn of 1926 La Brière had a private audience with <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XI">Pope Pius XI</a> in which a solution to the official Catholic position on the <a href="Action%20Fran%C3%A7aise">Action Française</a> short of condemnation was discussed.
The report of the audience was circulated widely.
The Pope said he was not against monarchist politics, but was concerned with the question of moral and religious influence.
At the start of December a circular from the <a href="nunciature">nunciature</a> said bishops should not grant chaplains to Action Française groups because of the risk of confusion between religion and politics.
On 20 December 1926 the Pope recommended that Catholics unite in a national Catholic federation to defend religious liberties.
The League's president, <a href="Bernard%20de%20V%C3%A9sins">Bernard de Vésins</a>, resisted condemnation of the entire executive of the League by the church. 
He visited Yves de La Brière on 8 January 1927, then informed the royalist pretender <a href="Prince%20Jean%2C%20Duke%20of%20Guise">Prince Jean, Duke of Guise</a>, that La Brière was under orders from the Vatican to form a rival organization in the hope of rallying Catholics from the Action Française, and was hoping for the duke's approval.

Yves de La Brière was among the presenters at the first of the <a href="Davos%20University%20Conferences">Davos University Conferences</a> in 1928, which was also attended by <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>.
In 1935 he reviewed <a href="Hans%20Morgenthau">Hans Morgenthau</a>'s "La Réalité des normes en particulier des normes du droit international: Fondements d’une théorie des normes" (Paris: Alcan, 1934), saying "Let us simply admit our perplexity with regard to this volume. We are not sure to have understood what the author is trying to signify and demonstrate. Not only is the French deficient, but the clarity of language and of thought seem insufficient ... But again, we undoubtedly have not understood anything and blush at our lack of perspicacity."

Yves de La Brière died in San Miguel, Argentina, on 25 February 1941.

Beginning in 1867, he took part in the faculty for the creation of the <a href="Jules%20Jamin">Jules Jamin</a> laboratory for the physical research of the <a href="Faculty%20of%20Sciences">Faculty of Sciences</a> of <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. In 1870, he proposed to carry out a telegraphic link by river sending strong currents into the Seine from generators behind the lines of the Prussian army and receiving the residual current in Paris by means of very sensitive galvanometers. The tests were carried out with great difficulty due in particular to the very severe winter, with <a href="Paul%20Desains">Paul Desains</a> thanks to the financing of <a href="Marcellin%20Berthelot">Marcellin Berthelot</a>. During this same siege, he organized the electric lighting of the city of Paris and was therefore named Knight of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honor">Legion of Honor</a> by decree of December 31, 1872 rendered on the report of the Minister of War.

The Curie brothers.
Just before leaving the role of preparer, Bourbouze noticed a young student, <a href="Pierre%20Curie">Pierre Curie</a> who was preparing his Bachelor of Science degree in the Faculty of Science. He then took him as assistant to the preparation of François Leroux's physics course at the Ecole Supérieure de Pharmacie de Paris. Bourbouze also met <a href="Jacques%20Curie">Jacques Curie</a> who succeeded him at the Ecole Supérieure de Pharmacie de Paris. In 1886, Bourbouze was the builder of an electrometer and an apparatus for the study of the piezoelectric quartz invited by the Curie brothers. He also developed at the end of his life a process of welding aluminum (patent June 6, 1884), with an aluminum-tin alloy, the study of which was continued by his widow.

Manufacture of instruments.
Jean Gustave Bourbouze manufactures several instruments during his <a href="career">career</a> in <a href="France">France</a>. He used them for <a href="research">research</a> and <a href="teaching">teaching</a>.

Instruments manufactured by Bourbouze.
Some of the instruments manufactured by Bourbouze are as follows:

Laboratories of Bourbouze.
Jean-Gustave Bourbouze had acquired a great reputation: "There are very few current physicists who have not known M. Bourbouze either at the Sorbonne, where he was for a long time preparing the course Of physics, or in the course of experimental physics that he had installed in his home.". 

One of his pupils, Charles-Jérémie Hemardinquer, a student at the Faculty of Sciences, collected the notes left to his death by Bourbouze and collected by his widow, notes in which he had written about operating modes for the classes that he made free on his Sunday. In 1895, he published a work entitled "Modes opératoires de physique" by Gabriel Lippmann, who had known Bourbouze when he was a student, like "Modest and learned man, model preparer and skilled builder at the same time as inventor engineer".

In the school year 1895-96, 80 pupils attended the courses. In 1899-1900 there were 320 pupils. In 1908, the teaching sessions of Laboratoires Bourbouze welcomed 150 students divided into eight sections: general <a href="physics">physics</a>, <a href="optics">optics</a>, <a href="electricity">electricity</a>, <a href="analytical%20chemistry">analytical chemistry</a>, <a href="industrial%20chemistry">industrial chemistry</a>, <a href="photography">photography</a>, <a href="micrography">micrography</a> and <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a>..

An association of pupils and former students of the Bourbouze laboratories is created, an association which publishes the journal l'Actualité scientifique: a monthly journal of pure and applied sciences.

Training laboratory technicians.
In 1909 Charles-Jérémie Hemardinquer created the <a href="Scientia%20Technical%20School">Scientia Technical School</a>, in the form of a limited company, at 23 rue François-Gérard, which will train laboratory technicians. and new premises for the Bourbouze laboratories were inaugurated in 1911 at 40 rue des Allouettes.

Rijkevoort

Rijkevoort is a church village with more than 1600 inhabitants. Until 1942, Rijkevoort together with Beugen formed the municipality of Beugen and Rijkevoort. This municipality was then split and Rijkevoort joined the municipality of Wanroij. Since the municipal reorganization of 1 January 1994, most of Rijkevoort belongs to the municipality of Boxmeer. The neighborhood Rijkevoort-De Walsert was then added to the municipality of Sint Anthonis.

Toponymy.
The name Rijkevoort consists of two parts. 'Forward' means 'ford' and 'rich' is probably derived from 'Rijt', meaning 'watercourse'.

History.
Originally, Rijkevoort is an agricultural mining settlement founded by Beugen. The surrounding area was initially marshy. Field names like: Walsertse Broek, Papenvoortse Broek, Laageindebroek, Hoogeindebroek and Rijkevoortse Broek remind you here. These are relatively low-lying areas east of the Peel high.

The oldest mention of Rijkevoort dates back to 1487

Sint-Rochuskerk.
Since the end of the 15th century, in Rijkevoort there was a chapel dedicated to Saint Rochus but not a full parish church, but depending on the parish of Beugen: Marriage and baptism occurred there. True, twice a week, a Carmelite came from Beugen to Rijkevoort to give the Mass, but on high days one had to go to Beugen. In 1648, the chapel was withdrawn from the government by the state authority. Only in 1722 was Rijkevoort elevated to an independent parish and there was a barn church. Around 1800 were Catholics back their chapel again, but from 1819 to 1820 the chapel was substantially enlarged which was only kept the choir. In 1888 a new, neo-Gothic church was built. Archirtect was Johannes Kayser. In 1927, the church was re-enlarged, now by father and son Caspar and Joseph Franssen. As the number of parishes continued to grow, it was proposed in 1956 to demolish this church and replace it with a new one. However, this did not continue so that the church remained.

Windmill.
In the middle of the village is the setting mill Luctor et Emergo from 1901

Monastery.
In 1924, the Missionaries of Precious Blood came to Rijkevoort. There were about 47 sisters living at the altitude of the monastery. About 2000, the last sisters, who all reached a high age, left for Tienray. Their sober monastery building is still in Rijkevoort.

Nature and landscape.
The Sint Anthonisloop, a channeled side branch of the Lage Raam, runs through the center of the village. The Lage Raam flows south of the village. These watercourses take care of the drainage of the former trout areas, all of which are mined to the agricultural area on a few strips of trees along the watercourses.

Sport.
Football club Toxandria, volleyball club Luctor and tennis association TeVeR are associations from Rijkevoort. The football club, as well as several other organizations of (Catholic) associations, which largely disappeared in the course of history, were founded by master Gerard van den Berg, head of the boys school in Rijkevoort. To him, in the center of Rijkevoort, was called the Meester van den Bergplein.

Heemkunde circle.
As in many villages and cities, Rijkevoort also has a Heemkunde circle, which is called, Heemkundevereniging Rieckevorts Heem, which has its own website.

Ruth Katz

Ruth Katz (b.1927) – Israeli musicologist, a pioneer of academic musicology in Israel, and professor emerita at the <a href="Hebrew%20University%20of%20Jerusalem">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>. Corresponding  Member of the American Musicological Society (2011); laureate of the Israel State Prize (2012). Her scientific work addresses a wide spectrum of topics- Western music, ethnomusicology, philosophy and aesthetics of music, and music cognition – and is noted for methodological sophistication, broad interdisciplinary perspectives and a synthetic view focusing on unveiling the ideational components – thought patterns, philosophical ideas, and social structures – embedded in the concrete musical phenomenon. Also recognized for her contribution to the general historiography and sociology of culture and art, to aesthetics, and to ethnography and anthropology.

Biography.
Ruth Katz (née Torgovnik) was born in Germany and immigrated to Israel/Palestine in 1934 with her family, settling in Tel Aviv. After graduating from the mythological "Herzliya" gymnasium, military service in the Israel Defence Forces, and a short period at the Israel Ministry of Defence, she was sent to New York (1950) by the Jewish Agency's Youth department, as an emissary to the Inter-collegiate Zionist Federation of America. In New York, alongside activities entailed by her mission, she attended Columbia University (BA 1954, MA 1956, PhD 1963, all "summa cum laude"). Returning to Israel with her husband (1956), she taught at the Oranim teachers' college and began research in ethnomusicology. In 1963, she was among the founders of the department of musicology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (the first in the country), where she taught and performed numerous university functions until her retirement in 1995, and became known for academic innovation, including many new programs she developed and led, e.g. the "Amirim" interdisciplinary excellence program (the first of its kind in Israel, 1989-1995). In addition, Katz was president of the Israel Musicological Society (1982-1985), chief musical editor of "Encyclopaedia Hebraica" (starting 1969), and served on the Israel Broadcasting Authority committee on music (1966-1978) and Israel Ministry of Education advisory board on higher education in music (1968-1975). In broader spheres of the humanities and social sciences, Katz was, "inter alia", fellow of the "Wissenschaftskolleg" Berlin (1986-7), University of Pennsylvania Institute for Judaic Studies (1995), Bellagio Center of the Rockefeller Foundation (1997) and the Liguria Center of the Bogliasco Foundation (1999). A sought-after speaker in forums such as Columbia University’s prestigious Paul Lazarsfeld Memorial Lectures (1992) and the Sterosta Lectures on Interdisciplinarity at the Hebrew University (1984), Katz was honored by an international colloquium on "Interdisciplinarity and Advancement in the Arts and Sciences" (the Hebrew University, 2008.) In 2011 she was elected a corresponding member of the American Musicological Society, and in 2012 received the Israel Prize, the highest state recognition of scholarly achievement in Israel.

Research.
Western music: practice, theory, philosophy, society.
Unveiling the ways in which the manifold forms of music and their surrounding historical worlds mutually constitute each other has been the underlying theme of Katz's work since her dissertation (1963) , that differentiated between Western art music since 1600 from what preceded it in epistemological, sociological and culture-historical terms, challenging well-established views concerning the rise of opera. The dissertation linked the emergence of opera and related musico-dramatic forms in the early 17th century to the "<a href="Scientific%20Revolution">Scientific Revolution</a>" concomitantly under way throughout the West, presenting the former as expressions of a new music- aesthetic paradigm that emerged through "experiments" exploring the powers of music. On a more local level, Katz further attributed these developments to a 16th-century Italian tradition of proto-scientific, magic engagement with music, and to Italian literary and dramatic genres, thereby explaining why the operatic genre emerged in Italy rather than elsewhere, even though similar ideational developments took place throughout the West. Formulating the new paradigm thus in music-aesthetic terms, Katz applied it to the development of the operatic medium until the 1980's.

Katz's work on the constituting interactions between aesthetic ideas and the development of musical styles continued in her monumental "Contemplating Music" (1987-1991; with <a href="Carl%20Dahlhaus">Carl Dahlhaus</a>) , a four-volume annotated anthology containing important texts by major thinkers, and mapping the main topics at the center of Western philosophy of music from Classical Greece to the 20th century.

Continuing her exploration of the thinking embedded in the concrete musical phenomenon in “History as ‘Compliance’: The Development of Western Musical Notation in the Light of Goodman’s Requirements,” (1992) , Katz connected analytical philosopher <a href="Nelson%20Goodman">Nelson Goodman</a>'s influential theory of the "Languages of Art" to the 500-year-long process that historically produced Western musical notation. 

The twin volumes "Tuning the Mind" and "The Arts in Mind" (2003, with <a href="Ruth%20HaCohen">Ruth HaCohen</a>) revealed the ideational components embedded in the language of Western art music of the 17th and 18th centuries, that eventually culminated in the Classical style. Using a double perspective – the thought of late-18th-century English men of letters on the one hand, and modern cognitive science, on the other – these volumes analyze the music as "sense formations without predication" , in terms of the contemporary styles and genres, and via an examination of music's relation to its "sister arts", at the same time exposing the debt owed by present-day cognitive theories to historical aesthetic ideas and artistic practices.

A comprehensive synthesis of Katz's work on Western music appeared in her "A Language of its Own: Sense and Meaning in the Making of Western Art Music" (2009) , a philosophical history of music examining Western art music in its entirety (10th to 20th centuries) as a unique "tradition" among other musical traditions of the world. By tracing the continuing and often-heated dialogue between music and the theoretical and aesthetic discourse about it, as represented in music-theoretical writings throughout the centuries (that, in their turn, took part in the broader intellectual and cultural discourse of their time), Katz showed how the Western musical mentality, driven by an urge towards rationality, emerged from the vital interactions between intellectual production and musical creation, thereby explaining many of Western music's immanent distinctive properties, and offering, in a way, what may be considered a detailed elaboration of <a href="Max%20Weber">Max Weber</a>'s famous thesis concerning the rational basis of Western society. The book follows in detail the process whereby Western music developed into a system of signification without external reference ("a language that explains itself from within") culminating in the Classical style of the late 18th century, this as an expression of concomitant changes in intellectual and social history. The book then traces the process of Western music further, into the 19th and 20th centuries, in which it became the locus of epistemological innovation anticipating linguistic and cognitive theories. Finally, Katz shows the gradual disintegration, in the 20th century, of that self-referential system, the drive towards which had informed Western music for the entire second millennium.

Ethnomusicology: the Middle East and folk traditions in Israel/Palestine.
Katz's ethnomusicological work focuses on folk music in Israel – Palestinian Arab folk singing, music of the different Jewish communities, and the Israeli composed "folksong" – this, too, with the aim of unveiling the constituting ideational components –be they universal-cognitive patterns or culture-specific schemes. Part of these studies was conducted in collaboration with <a href="Dalia%20Cohen">Dalia Cohen</a>, with whom Katz founded, in the 1950's, the Laboratory for Analysis of Vocal Information at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and led jointly, producing influential methodological and theoretical breakthroughs.

A turning point in Katz & Cohen's laboratory work was the development (in the mid 1950's) of the first model of the "Jerusalem <a href="melograph">melograph</a>" , an electronic apparatus transcribing orally-transmitted monophonic music as a continuous graph representing changes in pitch and loundness over time, thereby providing information that is not only precise but also independent of cultural, stylistic, and notational conventions concerning three out of the four psycho-acoustic parameters (pitch, duration and loudness; timbre was added later). The melograph was at the base of all of Katz and Cohen's ethnomusicological work, since it made it possible to unveil latent principles regulating musical practice that are not expressed in a musical theory, cannot be extracted aurally or through use of available forms of notation (most of the work concerned oral traditions, to begin with), and of which not only researchers but also the carriers of the tradition were mostly unaware. Similar apparati were invented concomitantly but independently in Norway (<a href="Olav%20Gurvin">Olav Gurvin</a>) and the USA (<a href="Charles%20Seeger">Charles Seeger</a>), but the processing of the findings of the Jerusalem <a href="melograph">melograph</a> was accompanied by new, more culturally-independent theoretical categories, that proved highly fruitful not only for the specific musical traditions, but also for comparative ethnomusicological research in general, becoming widely accepted in the field, with implications for music-cognition research.

For example: the category of "<a href="Melody%20type">Melody type</a>", expanded by Katz and Cohen in their studies of Arabic music concerning questions of mode, a subject not well defined in oral musical traditions (even where there is a modal theory) and that has defeated many scholars. Katz and Cohen showed that even in cases of extreme variability, one can discover modal regularity in musical practice, if one defines it as a "type of <a href="intonational%20skeleton">intonational skeleton</a>" that may be realized by varying quantitative values. Katz and Cohen expanded the concept of “type” further, showing that many traditions conform to a system of "types" not only concerning mode, but in other parameters as well, some more latent that others, e.g. melismaticism, beat and density tempos, or timbral categories. This made it possible to formulate the aesthetic preferences of each tradition in terms of "type". It should be stressed that since aspects such as these change from one performance to the next, "typical" regularity necessarily relates also to the extent, range, and properties of variability, as well as to relations between manifest and latent factors.

The <a href="melograph">melograph</a> was eventually integrated into computerized methodologies, leading to further elaboration and to its application beyond ethnomusicology: e.g. in the study of Hebrew prosody, or in Western music performance studies.

Katz & Cohen’s monumental "Palestinian Arab Music: Latent and Manifest “Theory” of a Maqām Tradition in Practice" (2005) is a summary of 40 years of collaborative research into the vocal folk music of the Arabs in Israel. In addition to many findings concerning the particular tradition and its methodological and analytical sophistication, the book engages fundamental questions of ethnomusicology and general anthropology concerning the meaning of modal frameworks, the combination of text and music appearing as a-priori fusions, the dynamic between continuity and change in living oral traditions and the role of the individual creative artist therein, or how to assess authenticity.

Katz's other ethnomusicological research addressed inter alia the music of the Samaritans (1974), in which she identified a case of "oral group notation"' and a connection to the medieval Christian Neannoe-Ninnua , showing that both are rooted in earlier Hebrew traditions. In other studies she examined the singing of Baqqashot by the Aleppo Jews (1968; 1970), applying the notion of mannerism (until then applied mainly to Western art), as an index of cultural change. Both cases served Katz as test cases of the fundamental anthropological question concerning the reliability of oral traditions, a subject that continued to occupy her in various interdisciplinary international forums, as well as in her book "The Lachmann Problem" (2004), about <a href="Robert%20Lachmann">Robert Lachmann</a>, a pioneer of comparative musicology who fled to Palestine from Nazi Germany. The book weaves together the history of the discipline, from its origins as "comparative musicology" in Germany of the early 1900's and the Weimar Republic with the history of the <a href="Yishuv">Yishuv</a> in British-mandate Palestine and of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

<doc id="54768974" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54768974" title="Geniusology">
Geniusology

Geniusology, offered by Dr. Andrei Aleinikov in 2003, is a science of <a href="genius">genius</a>. It is a relatively new science that studies <a href="genius">genius</a> (geniusness) as a phenomenon of huge theoretical and practical importance for the <a href="society">society</a>. 

Prehistory.
Thousands of biographies on lives of famous philosophers like <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and others; scientists like <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Einstein</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newton</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Kepler</a>, and more, composers like <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>; writers like <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Tolstoy</a> and poets like <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>; artists and sculptors like <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> and <a href="Auguste%20Rodin">Rodin</a> as well as extraordinary inventors like <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Edison</a> and <a href="Nikola%20Tesla">Tesla</a> written during the known humanity history, in the XIX-XX centuries boiled down to hundreds of research works attempting to generalize this vast data and to make some scientific sense of it. 

This research effort led scientific circles to understanding that a phenomenon as complex as genius just cannot be explained by biology/physiology (brain structure), by genetics (heredity in living organisms) or psychology (rearing/upbringing/life events) alone. Genius is broader than that. Genius that exists on the cross section of creativity research (that only recently became a <a href="science">science</a> itself) and intellect research (<a href="Cognitive%20science">cognitive sciences</a>) has also a social aspect because genius does not exist without society (existential dependence). That’s why, a modern science that would generalize the available data, build mathematical models, test some hypotheses, and finally explain the essence of the genius phenomenon to public – was needed. Moreover, this should be a separate science – the science specifically dedicated to genius (not creativity, not intellect, etc.) because the phenomenon of genius is so complex. Just as there is, for instance, criminology as the study of crime and criminals for understanding the lowest layers of the society, there should be the science of Geniusology as the study of extraordinary achievements and geniuses for understanding the highest layers of the society, actually, the layers of eminence.

History.
The science of genius, Geniusology, was offered by Dr. Andrei Aleinikov, Founding President, International Academy of Genius. As the author states in his article “Genius,” published in the Springer "Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship" in 2013 and now the second edition in 2017 (Aleinikov 2013, 2017), he mentioned the new science Geniusology for the first time during his speech at the Teachers' Conference in Singapore (2003) and then officially published a paper on it in the USA in in 2003-2005. Some main concepts of Geniusology, according to the author, such as the new scientific definition of genius, the genius methods of thinking, like megacreativity, the new classifications of geniuses -- were published much earlier, particularly in his book "MegaCreativity: Five Steps to Thinking Like a Genius," which was republished by John Whiley and Sons, became a bestseller in Asia in 2003, and has been translated to many languages since.

Etymology.
The word "geniusology" stems from the Latin [ˈɡɛ.nɪ.ʊs] «household guardian spirit» now often understood as some outstanding achievement person and ancient Greek λόγος (logos) «word, articulation, reason» now understood and used as “the science of” in -logy.

Essence.
As opposed to numerous pre-scientific definitions (emotional, colorful, as they should be in the fiction literature — the article offers a list of them – see Aleinikov, 2013, 2017), Geniusology defines the concept of genius purely as a combination of characteristics, each of which is necessary and all of them combined are sufficient for the essence of the notion (not traits of human character). This definition includes four absolutely necessary and altogether sufficient for the existence of the concept elements. 

A genius, according to Geniusology, is a person (A) top-valued by the society (B) for the uniquely expressed highly innovative vision (C) of the world (D). A graphic vision showing how genius expands the culture of the society (which explains why some of geniuses are recognized only in 50-100 years) and a matrix for testing the definition on the most famous geniuses of the past are offered [see Graph]. 

A genius, according to Geniusology, is more societal than psychological and biological phenomenon. If stated sharply – to the level of paradoxical simplicity -- genius is nothing more but the highest verbal reward of the grateful society to the individual for extraordinary input into the culture (that’s why so many self-nominating candidates call themselves geniuses – they want this reward!).

Application and future directions .
The science of genius is created with the purpose of understanding what genius is. Its mission is to research genius lives, genius learning, genius thinking, genius solutions, genius ideas, genius imagination, genius character, genius feelings, genius habits, genius skills, genius upbringing, genius environment, genius growth, and decline, etc. Now that the scientific model is created, the raw data can be meticulously placed into the cells of the new concept.  

In October 2017, the biographical authority, "Marquis Who’s Who" named Dr. Andrei Aleinikov, an award-winning scientist and educator who was earlier officially nominated for top American awards both in science and education (the President’s National Medal of Science, NSF, 2003-2006, and U.S. Professor of the Year Award, 2003, by Troy University for his founding of several new sciences, including Geniusology) – a winner of the prestigious Life Achievement Award.

Discussion.
Some other attempts to mention or to name the science of genius can be found in the works of Lev Gelimson, who studied Tsiolkovskiy, and offered two versions in Russian which would would be transliterated into English like this: Unigenielogy and Unigeniusology. Uni- obviously comes from universal, universe, but the name is pretty close.

The Administration of the Autonomous Communities, also known as Autonomous Administration, is a <a href="Public%20Administration%20of%20Spain">Public Administration of Spain</a>. It belongs to the second level of the Public Administrations, because it exerts its powers within the limits of each <a href="Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">Autonomous Community</a>.

It is integrated by:


The Autonomic Administration has a very broad level of competence, based on the <a href="decentralization">decentralization</a> of the State or through the State of Autonomies. As for the level of competences, they are not always the same, and are regulated in each <a href="Statute%20of%20Autonomy">Statute of Autonomy</a> for each <a href="Autonomous%20Community">Autonomous Community</a>, making in some cases the level of competences is higher than those of a <a href="Federal%20state">Federal state</a>.

It should also be taken into account that the Autonomous Community has its own <a href="legislative%20body">legislative body</a>, and that the autonomous administration must behave before it like any other <a href="executive%20power">executive power</a>, respecting the rules issued by its autonomous parliament.

In the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201978">Spanish Constitution of 1978</a> it is regulated in Chapter Three, entitled "of the Autonomous Communities". This Chapter regulates the form of creation and authorization of the Autonomous Communities, the elaboration of its Statutes, the powers transferred to the Autonomous Communities, the powers of the State, its resources and its financing.

Structure.
Like the <a href="General%20State%20Administration">General State Administration</a>, the Autonomous Administration is regulated by Law 40/2015 and the structure is practically the same. However, it can vary from one Autonomous Community to another depending on the provisions in the Statute of Autonomy. Here the common organs are exposed:

Central Organization.
Government.
The Autonomous Government is the executive power of the <a href="Autonomous%20community%20of%20Spain">Autonomous Community</a>. As in the <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Central Government</a> it responds before its <a href="parliament">parliament</a> (autonomic parliament). The Government directs the Autonomous Administration within its competences. 

Contrary to what happens with the Central Government, the decisions taken by the Executive are not sanctioned by the <a href="King%20of%20spain">King</a>, and it is the President of the Autonomous Community who signs the laws and decisions on his behalf.

President.
The President of the Autonomous Community is the head of the executive power as well as the highest authority of the Autonomous Community. He directs the Autonomous Government, elects its Vice President and Councilors and decides the policies that the government carries out.

As at the State level, the President may elect more than one Vice President and may freely separate his Vice-Presidents and Councilors. If the President is ceased, they cease with him.

Councilors.
The Councilors of the Autonomous Community are like the <a href="Minister%20%28government%29">Ministers</a> of the Central Government. They lead a "Consejería" (government department as a <a href="Ministry%20%28government%20department%29">Ministry</a>). Councilor work in their governamental area and appoint the members of their department like Vice Councilors, General Directors...etc

The figure of the Vice Councilor or Deputy Councilor is not always present, because it is the decision of the Councilor to exist or not this position and, in Autonomous Communities of small size where the work is not much, often these positions do not exist.

General Directors.
The General Directorates are management departmental bodies and steering bodies, hierarchically inferior to the Councilors or Vice Councirlos (if they exist). The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent. It should be noted that the Royal Decree on the structure of the Department may omit the first requirement because it is a General Directorate whose exceptional characteristics require that the holder does not have the status of official of the State.

Cabinets.
They are consultation bodies generally composed of a technical secretary and several technicians who support the President, Vicepresident, Councilors, ect. in their relations with institutions, in making decisions and performing special advisory tasks in a particular branch of knowledge.

Peripheral Administration.
Territorial Delegations.
The Territorial Delegations of the Autonomous Communities carry out the same activity as the Delegations of the Central Government. They are administrative bodies whose head is a high position appointed in the discretion of the Autonomous Government. He is in charge of the management of the Autonomous Administration in some of the territorial divisions of the Autonomous Communities, such as the <a href="Provinces%20of%20Spain">Province</a>.

Sectoral Delegations.
The Sectoral Delegations of the Consejerías are organs that represent the different Departments of an autonomous government. The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent

<doc id="54769157" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54769157" title="Dąbrówka High School (Poznań)">
Dąbrówka High School (Poznań)

Dąbrówka High School in Poznań (officially in Polish: VII Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Dąbrówki w Poznaniu, in abbreviated version known also as VII LO or colloquially simply as Dąbrówka) is a public school, located in the <a href="Pozna%C5%84">Poznań</a> district of ; it offers education to teenagers above 15 years of age. Founded in 1919, until 1967 it operated as an establishment for girls only. Currently its somewhat distinctive profile is marked by two features. One is that jointly with a secondary school named Gimnazjum Dwujęzyczne im. Dąbrówki the college forms a common administrative and educational unit, officially known as Zespół Szkół Ogólnokształcących nr 10. Another is that since 1994 the college has been offering a bilingual, Polish-German curriculum, complete with the <a href="Deutsches%20Sprachdiplom">Deutsches Sprachdiplom</a> II exams. In terms of educational performance the school ranks in-between the best and the mid-range college-type schools in Poznań.

Foundation and beginnings (1919).
When in late 1918 political power in Poznań was claimed by the local Polish structures of <a href="Naczelna%20Rada%20Ludowa">Naczelna Rada Ludowa</a>, all city female high schools, the so-called Höhere Mädchenschule, were German in terms of instruction language and general outlook. The oldest and the most prestigious of them was the public <a href="Luisenschule%20%28Posen%29">Luisenschule</a>. In the early 1919 the establishment was paralyzed by a conflict between German staff and the NRL delegate, Maria Swinarska, tasked with introducing instruction in <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>. It is not clear whether the strife contributed to future fate of the school. In May the Polish schooling board, Prowincjonalne Kolegium Szkolne, decided to break with the Luisian tradition, perceived as tantamount to Germanisation. In somewhat obscure circumstances the school was re-named after a medieval princess <a href="Doubravka%20of%20Bohemia">Dąbrówka</a>; the choice was supposed to underline patriotically Polish, anti-German and regional identity. The institution commenced the schooling year of 1919/1920 as Państwowa Uczelnia Żeńska Dąbrówki. Until then most German staff had left, partially replaced by newly hired Polish teachers; Maria Swinarska was nominated the new headmaster. Official ceremony emphasized re-launch rather than continuity; the 40-year-old premises taken over from Luisenschule were consecrated and following a solemn parade across the city the students joined erection of the . All paperwork, until mid-1919 conducted in German, was switched to Polish.

The Dąbrówka School took over from Luisenwschule a large compound located at the Western side of the ; it consisted of a front building, running along the street, and two large perpendicular buildings in the back, called the Northern One and Southern One; the backyard in-between was used as a sporting ground for <a href="Physical%20exercise">PE</a> lessons. Though with no electricity and no central heating, the premises were in perfect running condition. It seems that staff shortages were addressed fairly quickly, as in late 1919 there were 24 Poles among 35 teachers listed. The school retained its female profile; an unspecified number of girls commenced education in Luisenschule, but completed it already in the Dąbrówka School. Recruitment scale is not clear; the number of girls admitted in the very early 1920s ranges depending upon the source from 538 to above 1057. A huge number of candidates triggered opening of a new similar female school in the district, where some of the students admitted have been re-directed.

Ethnic composition of the girls is far from agreed; some authors claim that the Germans were in minority, others claim that they dominated; none of the sources consulted provides information on Jews, traditionally forming a significant fraction of the Luisenschule students. The number of schooling groups slightly exceeded 30, some 2/3 with instruction in Polish and 1/3 in German. Initially the school offered curriculum according to various teaching schemes and some sources claim that in fact there were five formulas co-existing: <a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">gymnasium</a>, <a href="lyceum">lyceum</a>, high lyceum (seminar for teachers), practice unit (training ground for seminarians) and a so-called economy school (of unclear formula). Given vastly different teaching modules, girls barely in teenage years might have mixed with young women.

Dąbrówka School (1919-1939).
Throughout most of the interwar period Dąbrówka was one of two public and one of five female high schools in Poznań in general; it was also the most prestigious one. The establishment was entirely Polish in terms of instruction language and general outlook. There is no information on groups with German, which must have disappeared in the early 1920s; later memoirs of Polish students only exceptionally refer to German colleagues. German textbooks and manuals were gradually being replaced with Polish ones. In terms of religion the school was clearly a Roman-Catholic one and none of the sources notes presence of <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> ministers. Until the late 1920s the overall number of students hovered around 800. Once a neo-humanist division was set up in 1929 - since 1936 operational as entirely separate - the number of girls probably decreased slightly.

The key feature of the school’s history in the interwar period was gradual homogenization of the curriculum; both decades, but especially the 1920s, are marked by constant effort to standardize and unify the teaching formula. Starting the 1920/21 schooling year the seminarian curriculum was being shorted by a year every schooling year; in parallel, also the practice school program was being reduced; both modules were closed in 1930 and from then on Dąbrówka did not educate teachers any more. Similarly, the 10-year lyceum curriculum was being curtailed gradually. It was the gymnasium module which started to dominate, though it was subject to change as well; the so-called <a href="realgymnasium">realgymnasium</a> curriculum was limited and it disappeared entirely in the early 1930s. Since then Dąbrówka adopted mostly a dual humanistic and neo-humanistic gymnasium profile; the latter differed due to emphasis on foreign languages. Once Gimnazjum Klaudyny Potockiej formally split off in the late 1930s Dąbrówka became a standard humanistic gymnasium. The school premises underwent major refurbishment in 1928 and electricity was fully introduced. The school boasted of having a modern meeting hall; it could have been used also as a chapel. Since 1930 the school owned a standard; it was also the year when the first Alumni Congress was held.

Recruitment was based on entry exams; the girls wore black uniforms with a beret and white embroidery, the tuition fee was 110 zł. The mid-bourgeoisie families dominated, represented mostly by civil servants and to a lesser degree commerce. There were two units, <a href="Sodality%20of%20Our%20Lady">Sodality of Our Lady</a> and a number of minor groups. At that time Dąbrówka, initially set up as a counter-offer to a Luisian tradition, started to claim the Luisenschule heritage. Exact motives are not clear, yet it seems that the board indented to bask in prestige of a hundred-year-old institution; in 1930 the school celebrated its centenary. In 1933 the establishment acquired a rural estate in Czernice in the <a href="Puszcza%20Zielonka%20Landscape%20Park">Zielonka Forest</a>, destination of frequent holiday trips later on. The school operated until the German conquest of Poznań in 1939; initially the premises hosted <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> units, later they were handed over to .

Female school in People's Poland (1945-1967).
During the <a href="Second%20world%20war">war</a> at least 11 students were killed by the Germans. When most of Poznań was seized by the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> yet with the German troops still holding out in the <a href="Fort%20Winiary">Citadel</a>, some teachers approached the nascent Polish administration about re-opening of the school; few days later the Młyńska premises were almost entirely destroyed during the final phase of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozna%C5%84%20%281945%29">battle</a>. An attempt to seize a non-school building still standing on the former Luisenschule plot proved unsuccessful. Following a brief period when the school operated jointly with the Potocka College and once a formal decision to re-open the school had been adopted, recruitment took place in the former Chamber of Commerce building. In 1945-1948 Dąbrówka was hosted in premises of Państwowe Liceum Pedagogiczne, and the former Colegium Marianum. The school commenced the schooling year of 1948/49 at , in the premises taken over from <a href="Saint%20Mary%20Magdalene%20High%20School%20in%20Pozna%C5%84">another college</a>, shut down as hotbed of reactionary education. At that time the heavily damaged building at Młyńska Street was refurbished and turned into a dormitory for non-resident girls of Poznań colleges.

The school soon returned to pre-war scale; in 1946 there were 730 girls enrolled. Initially education adhered to different formulas, resulting in age of students ranging from 11 to 28. The curriculum was unified in 1948, when the establishment was formally turned from Państwowe Gimnazjum i Liceum Żeńskie into Szkoła Ogólnokształcąca Stopnia Licealnego. In line with the nationwide framework of a 11-year general education scheme, the establishment offered schooling in 4 highest grades. Mounting political pressure introduced new rituals, modifications of curriculum, left-wing youth organizations and staff changes, which in the late 1940s resulted in totally new profile of the institution. It is not clear whether the school met expectations of the schooling board; on the one hand, control results were far from satisfactory and there are news of some conspiracy groupings among the girls, on the other, the school got Ministry of Education awards. The new policy climaxed after 1954, when Dąbrówka was re-named to VII Liceum Towarzystwa Przyjaciół Dzieci. In wake of the <a href="Polish%20October">1956 political thaw</a> both scouting and religious instruction re-appeared in school; in 1957 Dąbrówka returned to its traditional name.

In the late 1950s political pressure was resumed; in 1959 the school entered Association of Secular Schools, in 1960 last scouting units disappeared and religious instruction was terminated again. The early 1960s are the period of post-war demographic peak; the number of girls exceeded 1,000 and the number of teachers reached 150. The premises were entirely re-furbished in 1965; <a href="central%20heating">central heating</a> replaced previous old-fashioned systems, floors were re-done and electricity wiring got modernized; a canteen was opened, though as there was no kitchen meals were delivered by contracted-out providers. The mid-1960s is also the last period when the school enjoyed prestigious status; as centrally located and the oldest one in Poznań, it was frequently visited by officials and the girls used to represent the city youth at various state and local galas.

Standard format (1967-1994).
In 1967 the school was affected by a nationwide education reform. One change consisted of departing from upper tier of the 11-grade general education scheme, and replacing it with a 4-grade format of <a href="Liceum%20Og%C3%B3lnokszta%C5%82c%C4%85ce">Liceum Ogólnokształcące</a> (general education lyceum). Another change resulted from shutting down all female schools; it turned Dąbrówka into a mixed-sex school, the formula launched in the schooling year of 1967/68. The school was entirely re-formatted, especially that boys soon started to dominate; sporting and education successes, noted by the school at the turn of the decades, were accomplished mostly by male students. As the standard no longer corresponded to the mixed-sex profile it was withdrawn and none was used until a new one was officially introduced in 1973; during a solemn ceremony there was also an anthem adopted.

Right wing of the school building was heavily damaged by fire, which broke out in 1972. Since it proved unfeasible to complete refurbishment in parallel with usual education activities, some of the premises were shut down; this in turn resulted in overcrowding. Both the school management and the local schooling board started to consider relocation of Dąbrówka to some other premises, perceived as a provisional or perhaps a permanent measure. In the mid-1970s it was planned to move the establishment to the <a href="Rataje%2C%20Pozna%C5%84">Rataje district</a>, where a new schooling compound was being constructed from scratch; however, in unclear circumstances in 1978 the buildings were allocated to a newly opened lyceum. Later Dąbrówka was to move to another freshly-constructed settlement at Norwida Street in the Jeżyce district; eventually the site went to a primary school. The Żeromskiego Street premises emptied by the latter were eventually marked for Dąbrówka. It is there that the school commenced the schooling year of 1979/80. 

The Dąbrówka history of the 1980s reflects the tumultuous history of the country. In 1980 the staff founded a branch of <a href="Solidarno%C5%9B%C4%87">Solidarność trade union</a>; in 1981 the students made sure that a cross presented to the school by the Pope was during a solemn ceremony placed in the school foyer. The cross was withdrawn into a locked "memory hall" in 1982; this in turn caused that flowers were laid and removed from its doors. Some students were being detained during street riots or leafleting campaigns; unofficial scouting was implanted as a Green Six team. A large December 13, 1985 gathering of students marking the 4th anniversary of <a href="Martial%20law%20in%20Poland">martial law decree</a> produced disciplinary measures, though no-one has been expelled. In 1986 operatives detained a student in the school building while official launch of the 1986/87 schooling year turned into a scandal. In the late 1980s Dąbrówka became the nucleus of a sub-culture "" group. The cross was placed back in the foyer in 1991; in the new era changes among the managing board ensued. An initiative which would prove of high importance later was the launch of a broadened curriculum of German in 1987; Dąbrówka commenced collaboration with a school from <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a>, resulting in students’ exchange starting the year of 1988.

Bi-lingual school (after 1994).
Banking on earlier enhanced German curriculum experience, in the 1994/95 schooling year Dąbrówka opened a bi-lingual Polish-German unit; apart from a similar Polish-French one, operated by the , the initiative was a unique one in Poznań and in the <a href="Wielkopolska">Wielkopolska region</a>. The bi-lingual curriculum covered a 5-year scheme, including the 0 grade for oldest primary school students. Its scope was systematically broadened; in the late 1990s the school embarked also on a number of programs financed by the <a href="Bundesrepublik%20Deutschland">Bundesrepublik</a> and related to promotion of German culture and language. Dąbrówka commenced courses preparing for the Deutsches Sprachdiplom exam, which was for the first time offered in 1999; since then DSD II has been crowning the teaching of German in the school every year.

In wake of the nationwide it has been agreed that apart from being re-formatted into a 3-grade school, Dąbrówka would provide basis for setting up a 3-grade gymnasium, a phase in-between primary school and lyceum. It was also decided that both establishments would be located in the same premises at Żeromskiego Street. As the school board pointed that a 5-year enhanced German course could not be reduced to a 3-year scheme, the gymnasium was from the onset formatted as a bi-lingual one. Both units commenced the schooling year of 2001/02 as a joint Zespół Szkół Ogólnokształcących nr 10. Following a plebiscite held among its students, the nameless gymnasium adopted the name of Dąbrówka in 2004 and received its own standard. The year of 2002 saw birth of Stowarzyszenie Przyjaciół Szkoły im. Dąbrówki w Poznaniu, an alumni association which since has been organizing their irregular gatherings. Appointment of a new headmaster in 2007 marked a symbolic change; for the first time ever the post has been assumed by a male, and for the first time ever the vacancy was filled by means of public competition. Refurbishment works carried out were modest; they consisted mostly of repairing damages caused by minor 1998 fire and purchase of new equipment.

In the early 21st century both sections of the Dąbrówka school systematically advanced their specifics – rendering them distinct from other Poznań schools – by enhancing links to German culture and language. In 2005 for the first time some students completed education by taking bi-lingual <a href="matura">matura</a> exam; it has been offered since then every year until bi-lingual matura was scrapped nationwide by the Ministry. Also in 2005 the school joined the <a href="Jugend%20debattiert%20international">Jugend Debattiert International</a> program. In 2009 Deutsches Sprachdiplom II exams were for the first time offered at B2 and C1 levels. Around that time Dąbrówka engaged in Deutsch Wagen Tour scheme, co-organized internationally by Goethe-Institut, German embassies around the world and <a href="Deutscher%20Akademischer%20Austauschdienst">Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</a> . Systematic co-operation was forged with Bundesrepublik colleges in the towns of <a href="Seelze">Seelze</a>, <a href="Karlstadt%20am%20Main">Karlstadt</a> i <a href="Vreden">Vreden</a>. In 2010 Dąbrówka was one of 26 bi-lingual Polish-German lyceum-type schools in Poland and one of 10 bi-lingual Polish-German gymnasium-type schools in the country; apart from the lyceum in <a href="Leszno">Leszno</a> it was the only school of such type in the Wielkopolska region.

Present day.
Currently VII Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Dąbrówki in Poznań operates jointly with Gimnazjum Dwujęzyczne im. Dąbrówki as a common functional unit named Zespół Szkół Ogólnokształcących nr 10. Both establishments, legally separate, are hosted in the same building in the Jeżyce district at Żeromskiego Street 8/12; in terms of operations and management they are fairy integrated, sharing the same statute, pedagogical council, students’ board and parents’ board. They are formally managed by the municipality of Poznań and supervised by the regional schooling board; according to the 2016 financial report their assets amounted to 4,63m <a href="Polish%20z%C5%82oty">zł</a>. The lyceum keeps posing as a school cultivating the Luisian tradition and dates its history not from 1919 but from 1830; this is the reading dominating also in local media.

Recently there are some 135-155 students completing education in Dąbrówka every year. Compared to other Poznań colleges it is a mid-size school with some 450 students in all grades, much less than in or , which open 8 groups every year and can accommodate 250 new candidates each. In 2017 Dąbrówka offers 155 new seats in total, all divided among 5 sections profiled as focused on media, biology-chemistry, economy, engineering and bi-lingual Polish-German teaching, the latter divided into specialized sub-sections further on. In terms of popularity among gymnasium graduates the school ranks mid-range. During recruitment for the 2017/18 schooling year there were 1.08 candidates for every seat offered, compared to highest school average indicators in the city recorded by (2.28), (1.83) and (1.54). In case of Dąbrówka the toughest entry competition was recorded in the bi-lingual section (1.32) and in the biology-chemistry section (1.26).

Few independent institutions in Poland compile nationwide ratings of colleges in terms of their educational performance; in these charts Dąbrówka usually ranks in-between the best and the mid-range schools in Poznań. According to the most popular "" analysis, among some 30 college-type schools in the city Dąbrówka was rated on position 8 (2012), 7 (2013), 12 (2014), 12 (2015), 9 (2016) and 9 (2017). The school specifics is determined by two features. One is integration with the Dąbrówka gymnasium in a joint unit; since the gymnasium rates among the very best in Poznań, it operates as sort of a magnet for a lyceum. Another is the unique bi-lingual profile, linked to the DFD II exams offered; in 2017 no college in the Wielkopolska region outperformed Dąbrówka in terms of German language matura results. On the other hand, matura results in math, Polish, non-German modern languages and other subjects in Dąbrówka are visibly worse than in the best Poznań colleges. Also, the school recorded only 5 prized places in nationwide college-level competitions during the last 10 years; in comparison, the Mickiewicz College might boast of 29 prized places.

Sir Christopher Harris (c. 1553 – 1625) of <a href="Radford%2C%20Plymstock">Radford</a> in the parish of <a href="Plymstock">Plymstock</a> in Devon, was a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Plymouth%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Plymouth</a> in Devon in 1584. He was knighted in 1607. He should not be confused with his great-nephew and <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> <a href="Christopher%20Harris%20%28died%201623%29">Christopher Harris</a> (d.1623) of Lanrest in the parish of <a href="Liskeard">Liskeard</a> in Cornwall, a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="West%20Looe%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Looe</a> in Cornwall (1621). He was a close friend of Admiral Sir <a href="Frances%20Drake">Frances Drake</a>, who on one occasion lodged part of his captured treasure at Radford. In partnesship with <a href="John%20Hele%20%28died%201608%29">John Hele</a> (died 1608) 
of <a href="Wembury">Wembury</a> in Devon, <a href="serjeant-at-law">serjeant-at-law</a> and MP, Harris acquired the estate of <a href="Buckland%20Abbey">Buckland Abbey</a> in Devon as a seat for Drake. He owned the <a href="The%20Armada%20Service">The Armada Service</a>, a set of 31 silver dishes now in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. His contemporary the Cornwall historian <a href="Richard%20Carew%20%28antiquary%29">Richard Carew</a> (d.1620) wrote that he: ""admitteth no partner in the sweetly tempered mixture of bounty and thrift, gravity and pleasantness, kindness and stoutness, which grace all his actions"".

Origins.
He was the son and heir of <a href="William%20Harris%20%28born%201504%29">William Harris</a> (born 1504) of Radford, a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Newport%20%28Cornwall%29%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Newport-"juxta"-Launceston</a> in Cornwall in 1529, by his wife Catherine Trecarrel, a daughter and co-heiress of Henry Trecarrell ("alias" Esse) of <a href="Trecarrell">Trecarrell</a> in Cornwall.

Marriages & progeny.
He married twice as follows, but left no surviving progeny:

Succession.
As he died without surviving progeny, his heirs became the descendants of his only sister Jane Harris, who in 1562/3 at Menheniot in Cornwall married her cousin John Harris (died 1579) of Lanrest in Cornwall. Her eldest son (and thus <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> to his uncle) was <a href="John%20Harris%20%28MP%20for%20West%20Looe%29">John Harris</a> (1564 – June 1623) of Lanrest, Recorder (or Steward) of the Borough of <a href="West%20Looe">West Looe</a> in Cornwall (established in 1574) and MP for <a href="West%20Looe%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Looe</a> in Cornwall in 1614. However, as he predeceased his uncle by two years, he did not inherit, nor did his eldest son <a href="Christopher%20Harris%20%28died%201623%29">Christopher II Harris</a> (1590 – November 1623) of Lanrest, a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="West%20Looe%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Looe</a> in Cornwall (1621), who also predeceaded his great-uncle by two years, having survived his father by only a few months. It was thus Christopher II's younger brother <a href="John%20Harris%20%28Royalist%29">John Harris</a> (c. 1596 – 1648) of Lanrest, MP, who gained the inheritance.

Wagoner was the president of the Shakespeare Tercentenary Society, based at the Planters Hotel. The Honorary President was Dr. Denton J. Snider, a Shakespeare scholar. Originally a study club, dedicated to a consideration of Snider's Hegelian interpretation of Shakespeare, it became, after Wagoner took over the management, more and more social in orientation. In 1916 Wagoner curated the exhibition "Shakespeare Tercentenary Celebration" at the Scruggs-Vandervoort-Barney auditorium, St. Louis, of which she also curated the catalogue: curious, instructive and beautiful objects pertaining to Shakespeare and the stage. She was also vice-president of the National Shakespeare Federation.

On December 6, 1917, "World News" published a song by Wagoner, "Little Orphant Annie's Tale of the War", dedicated to the National Council of Defense. Always in 1917, "Music News" published other two songs, "Mammy's Song" and "The Mother Heart (Scotch lullaby)". Also Wagoner's mother was a lyricist, she wrote the words for "Let Us Sing of Old Missouri", music by Johanna Mohr, arranged by Esther M. Harkins.

Henry Küss

Henry Küss (or Henri Küss, 19 June 1852 – 22 November 1914) was a French mining engineer.
After brilliant studies at the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a> and <a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Mines">École des Mines</a> he was placed in charge of the mineralogical sub-district around <a href="Grenoble">Grenoble</a>.
While holding this position, he made overseas trips to Uruguay, Mozambique, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Spain, Tunisia and Australia (twice) to assess the potential of mining concessions, earning a high reputation among financiers. 
He was appointed an inspector-general of mines, and made important contributions to mining education and mine safety and hygiene regulations.

Early years.
Henry Küss was born in <a href="Cernay%2C%20Haut-Rhin">Cernay, Haut-Rhin</a>, on 19 June 1852.
He came from an old <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> family.
His father was Jean-Frédéric Küss (1805–62), a pastor, and his grandfather was Georges Charles Küss, an inspector of records at <a href="Colmar">Colmar</a> and <a href="Wissembourg">Wissembourg</a>.
An uncle and a cousin belonged to the <a href="Corps%20des%20ponts%20et%20chauss%C3%A9es">Corps des ponts et chaussées</a>, and another cousin became mayor of <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>.
His father had three sons by his first marriage, and ten children by his second marriage, to Louise Amélie Küss (his mother had the same maiden name).
Henri was the oldest boy of the second marriage.

When his father died his mother moved with her six living children to Strasbourg, where Henry was admitted to the Lycée de Strasbourg.
He was preparing for admission to the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a> when the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> broke out on 15 July 1870, preventing all movement.
After the war he went to Paris in March 1871 and studied briefly at the <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20Sainte-Barbe">Collège Sainte-Barbe</a> before being admitted to the École Polytechnique in the promotion of 1871.
After graduating, in 1873 he entered the <a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Mines%20de%20Paris">École des Mines de Paris</a>.
As part of his studies, he travelled in the summers of 1874–76 through the coalfields of northern France, Belgium, the <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr</a> and <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>, then the metallic regions of Germany and Austria, and finally the mines of Spain, the lead and zinc mines of Algeria, and the iron mines of the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Mokta%20El%20Hadid">Société Mokta El Hadid</a>.
In 1877 Küss graduated with brilliant results.
He became a member of the <a href="Corps%20des%20mines">Corps des mines</a>.
His memoir on the mercury mines and factories of <a href="Almad%C3%A9n">Almadén</a> in Spain was published in 1878.

Mining engineer.
Grenoble.
Henry Küss was appointed a 3rd class engineer in 1877, and for a year was attached to the Secretariat of the General Council of Mines, and also was entrusted with a district of the <a href="Chemins%20de%20fer%20de%20l%27Est">Chemins de fer de l'Est</a> (Eastern Railways) under the supervision of one of his uncles, Adolphe Küss, chief engineer of Ponts et Chaussées.
On 14 June 1878 he was sent to Grenoble to work for the mineralogical sub-district and control the <a href="Chemins%20de%20fer%20de%20Paris%20%C3%A0%20Lyon%20et%20%C3%A0%20la%20M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e">Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée</a>.
He held these two positions for twelve years.
He also went on several mineral and mining explorations in the Alps.
During his tenure the anthracite mines of <a href="La%20Mure">La Mure</a> gradually increased their output from 100,000 tons per year in 1877 to almost 150,000 tons in 1890, when he left the mining region.

Overseas voyages.
While at Grenoble Küss made a series of trips to evaluate mining concessions abroad.
From the end of December 1879 to the start of March 1880 Küss visited Uruguay to evaluate a gold concession near what would become <a href="Minas%20de%20Corrales">Minas de Corrales</a> on the Arroyo Corrales.
From May to December 1881 he was attached to a Portuguese mineral exploration mission in the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi</a> region, where he investigated possible gold deposits around the settlement of <a href="Tete%2C%20Mozambique">Tete</a>. 
At the end of 1882 he explored the Atajo gold mines in <a href="Catamarca%20Province">Catamarca Province</a>, Argentina.
In August 1885 Küss travelled to Panama, which he crossed by railway since the canal was not yet open.
He observed in a letter to his family, 

Küss went on via <a href="Lima">Lima</a> to <a href="Tacna">Tacna</a>, where he evaluated a copper mine, then up to the Bolivian plateau, where he inspected a silver mine. 
The owners of both mines wanted a professional opnion before investing further.
He returned via Panama on December 1885.
In 1887 Küss returned to Almaden to check the results of a trial for a new way of processing the mercury slags.

In 1888 Küss married Cécile Jeanne Weiss, daughter of a Registry official from Alsace whom he had met in Grenoble.
He had earned a high reputation among financiers and mining engineers, and was much in demand to review other potential mining projects, but now turned down all requests apart than one trip to Tunisia and two to Australia, on each of which he was accompanied by his wife.
Küss visited Tunisia in 1892 at the request of the <a href="Compagnie%20des%20chemins%20de%20fer%20B%C3%B4ne-Guelma">Compagnie des chemins de fer Bône-Guelma</a> to evaluate lead and zinc deposits in the <a href="Medjerda%20River">Medjerda</a> valley.
He spent July–October 1899 on a visit to Australia, where he surveyed minerals in <a href="Coolgardie%2C%20Western%20Australia">Coolgardie</a> and the <a href="Kalgoorlie">Kalgoorlie</a> district.
Many years later, in 1910, he returned to the same region of Australia to check the gold reserves, which appeared to be diminishing.
The results of his meticulous examination were recorded in an authoritative report.

Later appointments.
In the fall of 1890 the post of ordinary engineer of the western mineralogical sub-district of the <a href="Saint-%C3%89tienne">Saint-Étienne</a> coal basin became vacant.
The region had suffered a series of disasters at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2telus%2C%20Loire">Châtelus</a> (1887), Verpilleux (1889) and Villeboeuf (1890) mines.
The Minister of Public Works wanted an engineer who could reassure the mine workers and force the operators to improve safety measures.
In a six month period from October 1890 Küss enforced effective measures to prevent explosion of <a href="firedamp">firedamp</a> in the operations of the Roche-la-Molière et Firminy, Montrambert et La Béraudière, and Mines de la Loire companies.
These were later codified by the Administration as general regulations.
On 11 May 1891 Küss was appointed chief engineer of the <a href="Rodez">Rodez</a> mineralogical district. 
On 11 July 1891 he was made a knight of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a>.

On 10 February 1892 Küss was entrusted with the <a href="Douai">Douai</a> mineralogical district, including the mines of the <a href="Valenciennes">Valenciennes</a> basin, the industrial center of <a href="Lille">Lille</a> and the <a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Mines%20de%20Douai">École des Mines de Douai</a>, a post he held until 1906.
He had to deal with many issues concerning safe operation of mines, while also building up the mining school into an efficient training institute for professional miners.
To reassure critics who denounced training of civil servants and thought over-rapid improvement in the social status of workers would be dangerous, In 1905 Henry Küss stated that the pupils did "not need a very extensive scientific background, which they would anyway with very few exceptions be unable to assimilate.
On 1 August 1906 Küss was appointed Inspector General 2nd class in charge of the Southeast division.
In 1907 he was assigned to the Center division, including the École des Mines de Saint-Étienne.
In 1909 he was assigned to the Northwest division, with its great coal basins of Nord and Pas-de-Calais.

On 1 December 1911 Küss was made Inspector General 1st class.
He was fluent in English, German and Spanish, and was well-qualified to represent the Ministry of Public Works in international conferences.
In 1905 he participated in the Congress of Mining, Metallurgy, Mechanics and Applied Geology. 
In June 1910 he led the French delegation to the Congress of Mines and Metallurgy in <a href="Dusseldorf">Dusseldorf</a>. 
In August 1910 he visited the <a href="Brussels%20International%201910">Brussels Exhibition</a> and the Belgian Coal Basins to study facilities for hygiene of mining workers.
In September 1913 he participated in the mines section of the International Congress for the Rescue and Prevention of Accidents in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>.
At the time of his death in 1914 he was Chairman of the Inter-ministerial Commission for Air Navigation and Member of the Central Commission of Steam Engines, the Commission on Mine Hygiene, the Commission for Scientific Research on Firedamp and Explosives, the Advisory Committee on Railways and the Standing Committee on Mines, Hydromineral and climatic stations. 
For several years he was Technical Commissioner for the Military Commission on Mines.

Other activities.
The editors of the "Encyclopédie théorique et pratique des connaissances civiles et militaires" wanted to add a treatise on exploitation of mines. 
Henry Küss collaborated with Lucien François Fèvre (1862–1935) on this work, whose first instalment was published in July 1897.
It was to have 15 major chapters, but was incomplete at the time of Küss's death in 1914.
In fact, he was only able to write the 100-page section on mining geology at the start of the work.
<a href="Jules%20Aubrun">Jules Aubrun</a> was made an administrator for the mines in the <a href="Arras">Arras</a> Mineralogical District in the aftermath of the <a href="Courri%C3%A8res%20mine%20disaster">Courrières mine disaster</a> of 10 March 1906.
He came to the attention of Henri Küss and Lucien François Fèvre (1862–1935), and worked with them on their work on exploitation of mines.

At the time of the separation of church and state, Küss helped prepare the statutes and regulations of the northeast regional synod of Protestant churches, and was then asked to represent this group in the National Union of Reformed Evangelical Churches.
On 20 February 1914 Küss was appointed head of the <a href="%C3%89cole%20nationale%20sup%C3%A9rieure%20des%20mines%20de%20Paris">École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris</a> in succession to <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Delafond">Frédéric Delafond</a>, scheduled to start in August.
Due to the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–18) and his declining health he was unable to take up the position.
He was struck by illness in June 1914, and submitted to surgery.
From now on he was bed-ridden, attended by his wife and daughter.
Henry Küss died on 22 November 1914.

Liracraea epentroma is a species of <a href="sea%20snail">sea snail</a>, a marine <a href="gastropod">gastropod</a> <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Mangeliidae">Mangeliidae</a>.


Description.
The length of the shell attains 6 mm, its diameter 2 mm. 

(Original description) The small shell has a narrowly fusiform shape and a slender <a href="Spire%20%28mollusc%29">spire</a>.Its colour is light reddish-brown or dull- chestnut. It contains 5½ whorls, rounded or obscurely angled above the periphery, adorned with fine spiral and longitudinal <a href="Sculpture%20%28mollusc%29">sculpture</a>. The latter is strongest. The sutures are deep. The <a href="protoconch">protoconch</a> consists of about 1½ <a href="Whorl%20%28mollusc%29">whorl</a>s, strongly angled, and with
four smooth narrow revolving riblets, the posterior minute and situated near to the suture. The apical half-turn is obliquely curved down and somewhat imbedded in the succeeding whorl. The <a href="body%20whorl">body whorl</a> rather longer than the spire.

Adult sculpture : The longitudinals number fifteen to sixteen small riblets on the body whorl, equal to or rather wider than the interspaces, and usually less developed on the anterior end. They are continuous in some, irregular in others. The spirals consist of undulating delicate riblets and threads. On the spire-whorls there are two, and on the last seven or eight slightly stronger. Of these the four posterior are more widely spaced, two are above the outer <a href="Lip%20%28gastropod%29">lip</a> and one in line with it. They are frequently forming beads on crossing the longitudinals. Within these spaces there are, on that adjoining the suture, four or five threadlets, sometime irregular in size. On the succeeding three spaces, usually three threadlets in each, the median one frequently strongest. Anterior to this the interspaces contain one to three threads. The old beaks sometimes forms short irregular riblets. The <a href="Aperture%20%28mollusc%29">aperture</a> is of medium breadth, less than half its length. The outer lip is simple. The posterior sinus is shallow. The <a href="Columella%20%28gastropod%29">columella</a> is lightly curved. The anterior canal is short and broad.

The spirals on the anterior portion of the body whorl are somewhat variable in number and strength. The lightly angular appearance of the spire whorls in some individuals is due to the more prominent spirals being rather more pronounced. The spaces on these whorls are similarly adorned to the posterior portion of the last.

Caroline Ashurst Biggs

Caroline Ashurst Biggs (1840-1889) was an advocate for women’s rights and a third generation member of the Ashurst family of radical activists. Born in Leicester on 23 August 1840, she was the second child of Matilda Ashurst and Joseph Biggs. She died at 19 Notting Hill Square in London on 4 September 1889. At the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, her photograph was included in an exhibition of Portraits of Eminent British Women, in a section devoted to Pioneers in Philanthropy and General Advancement of Women.

Family Context.
On her father’s side Caroline Ashurst Biggs was niece to two radical Members of Parliament from Leicester: John Biggs and William Biggs. On her mother’s side her grandfather was the prominent British lawyer <a href="William%20Henry%20Ashurst%20%28solicitor%29">William Henry Ashurst</a>, influential in radical causes from abolishing the church rate taxes to Italian unification. Her aunt <a href="Elizabeth%20Ann%20Ashurst%20Bardonneau">Eliza Ashurst Bardonneau-Narcy</a> was among the first to translate <a href="George%20Sand">George Sand’s</a> novels into English. Her other aunt Emilie Ashurst Venturi was the main translator and propagandist for the Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini, the editor of The Shield (the magazine for repealing the Contagious Diseases Act), and the author of numerous essays. Her three sisters also left their mark in print: Elizabeth Ashurst Biggs (1838-1905) published two novels anonymously; Maude Ashurst Biggs (1857-1933) was an advocate for Polish nationalism and contributed 23 articles to "The Englishwoman’s Review"; Kate Ada Ashurst Biggs (1859-1901) published two articles in Gentleman’s Magazine.

Activism.
Caroline Ashurst Biggs was a strong advocate for women’s suffrage. Along with her sister Elizabeth and her aunts Emilie Venturi and Caroline Stansfeld, she signed the 1866 petition for Women’s Suffrage. Biggs, along with her father Joseph Biggs and her uncle William Henry Ashurst junior, was active in the London National Society for Women’s Suffrage (NSWS). Biggs and Clementia (Mrs. Peter A.) Taylor were elected together as joint secretary in 1867. She served until 1871 when John Stuart Mill agitated to get her removed because of her support for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. He wrote to a friend about Biggs, “This only makes her the more dangerous, and she will infallibly spring a mine on you some day which will be successful. . . So long as she remains in the Committee, you have a quiet, steady opponent, who will betray you to the enemy, and take advantage from within of all your weak points: one infinitely more dangerous than Mrs. Taylor ever could have been, because she knows her own mind and can keep her own counsel.” In 1872 Biggs broke away from the NSWS to join the executive committee of the Central Committee of the National Society for Women’s Suffrage. This splinter group included her sisters Caroline Stansfeld and Emilie Venturi, and important activists of the era such as Ursula Bright, Lydia Becker, Frances Power Cobbe, and Helen Blackburn. Biggs gave dozens of speeches encouraging women’s suffrage across Britain, including in Suffolk and Wales. In 1870 when women gained the right to vote in School board elections, Biggs actively supported women candidates and gave speeches publicly supporting them at rallies. 

Biggs was a member of Clementia Taylor’s group calling for the end of slavery: London’s Ladies Emancipation Society. Taylor changed the name after the Union victory in the American Civil War in 1865 to the London Negro Aid Society. She also was active in the Society for the Employment of Women, a cause frequently endorsed by "The Englishwoman’s Review".

Biggs started the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as Poor Law Guardians to get women hired to work with other women and children in workhouses. The Society reprinted and distributed her editorial "Women as Poor Law Guardians". She encouraged the formation of local committees and organized meetings. It was, in fact, James Stansfeld, the husband of her aunt Caroline Stansfeld, who appointed the first woman as a poor-law inspector in 1872 (Jane Elizabeth (Mrs. Nassau) Senior). At the time of her death, 76 women served in this capacity. 

Biggs activism included a moral dimension. Unlike her sister Kate and her aunt Caroline Stansfeld she was not a member of the Moral Reform Union. But she did sign a 1889 petition opposing the candidacy of Charles Dilke because of his divorce. 

Writings.
Caroline Ashurst Biggs wrote all her life. In an obituary, “A friend” wrote of her many accomplishments, all made with her “facile pen and fertile brain.” During her free time as a school girl, Biggs busied herself “collating and copying out the speeches of the Italian patriot and close family friend Giuseppe Mazzini for reproduction in a provincial newspaper.” He also wrote directly to her.

Biggs published "The Master of Wingbourne", a novel in two volumes, anonymously in 1866 when she was in her mid-twenties, but her obituary credits her as the author. The book was widely reviewed as “well told” and “deeply interesting.” It opens in 1830 and tells the story of the estate of Wingbourne through the eyes of a visitor. The owner and his nephew are drunkards; his daughter Florence is a victim of overindulgence and under-education, but the object of the narrator’s affections nonetheless. The book sets up feminist themes - Florence is cut out of inheriting because of her illegitimacy; the nephew and heir tries to force Florence to marry him by locking her in the house. She is betrothed three times in the story, which is ultimately a cautionary tale about marriage, power, wealth. Biggs herself never married, nor did her three sisters. Her sister Elizabeth Ashurst Biggs published two novels ("White and Black" (1862) and "Waiting for Tidings" (1874)), which have been mistakenly attributed to C. A. Biggs as author or co-author.

Biggs also published two short stories under the pseudonym Carey Search (inspired by her grandfather William Henry Ashurst who published articles in American and British newspapers as Edward Search), both focusing on issues related to women’s suffrage. 

In 1870 Biggs became the editor of the "Englishwoman’s Review", the longest-running English feminist publication of the era. For almost twenty years she shaped the “only complete, continuous record of the work done …by women, in this country and abroad, and of the progress of what has been termed the ‘Woman Question.’” She also contributed articles and corresponded with secretaries of women’s societies abroad, especially in Italy, France, and Norway. 

Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Matilda Joslyn Gage commissioned Biggs to write the chapter on Great Britain for volume III of their groundbreaking survey of early feminism: "The History of Woman Suffrage". It was published in 1887. 

Legacy.
After her death her colleagues set up a loan fund to assist women students of Cambridge attending Girton College. In fact her youngest sister Kate Ada Ashurst Biggs had graduated from Girton in 1877 with a masters in 1879.

Early life and education.
Eugene Bloch was born on 10 June 1878 in Soultz-Haut-Rhin. His father, industrialist in the textile industry, sold his Alsatian factory and settled in Paris to give his two sons Leon and Eugene a French education. Eugene trained from 1897 to 1900 at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, where he studied the physics of <a href="Jules%20Violle">Jules Violle</a>, <a href="Marcel%20Brillouin">Marcel Brillouin</a>, And <a href="Henri%20Abraham">Henri Abraham</a>, and at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris, where he studied the courses of <a href="Gabriel%20Lippmann">Gabriel Lippmann</a> and [ [Edmond Bouty]] and obtained the degrees in Physics and Mathematical Sciences in 1899.

He was a preparatory student at the Physics Laboratory of the <a href="Ecole%20Normale%20Sup%C3%A9rieure">Ecole Normale Supérieure</a>. Ph.D. in Physical Science on the ionization in phosphorescence which he supports before the <a href="Faculty%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Paris">Faculty of Sciences</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a> in 1904. 

Career and works.
Eugene Bloch then joined secondary school and in 1906 became professor of physics in the special mathematics class at the Saint-Louis secondary school in Paris, where he taught for eleven years. In addition to his teaching work, Eugene Bloch also carried out research work in the physics laboratory of the <a href="Ecole%20Normale%20Sup%C3%A9rieure">Ecole Normale Supérieure</a> on the photoelectric effect and spectroscopy.

In 1940 Eugene Bloch was dismissed from his post as professor by the anti-Jewish laws of the Vichy government and had to leave the <a href="Ecole%20Normale%20Superieure">Ecole Normale Superieure</a>. <a href="Georges%20Bruhat">Georges Bruhat</a> succeed him. It passes clandestinely in "free zone", and finds, in a laboratory of the University of Lyon, a refuge that is formalized in 1941 by a mission order of the National Center of the scientific research. When the German army invaded the "free zone", in 1942, Eugene Bloch tried to flee to Switzerland; But he does not find the possibility, and he takes refuge under a false identity in the mountains of Savoy. The <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> found and arrested him at <a href="Allevard">Allevard</a> on 24 January 1944; He was deported from <a href="Bobigny%20station">Bobigny station</a> by <a href="Convoy%20n%20%C2%B0%2069%20of%207%20March%201944">Convoy n ° 69 of 7 March 1944</a>.

In 1908 Bloch completed his studies that he had pursued in the wake of his thesis and devoted himself to studies on the photoelectric effect (discovered by Hertz in 1887 and then studied by Lenard around 1902); Unlike Lenard, Bloch understands the importance of distinguishing various colors, or wavelengths of light, instead of using white light; His experiments helped understand the interpretation given by Einstein in 1905.

In 1925 he developed the first spectrograph with a concave, reflective, and vacuum network, built in France, which allowed to work in ultra-violet very distant until the Wavelengths to 20 nanometers. The tables of wavelengths established with this apparatus on thirty chemical elements, and their variously charged ions, still render service.

<doc id="54769811" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54769811" title="St. Gallen Group">
St. Gallen Group

The St. Gallen Group, also known as the St. Gallen Mafia , was a group of high ranking, liberal-leaning clerics of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> who met discreetly at <a href="St.%20Gallen">St. Gallen</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, between 1995 and 2006 and was founded by <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Saint%20Gallen">Bishop of St. Gallen</a>, Ivo Fürer. The group was revealed to have existed in an officially authorised biography of one of the participants; Cardinal <a href="Godfried%20Danneels">Godfried Danneels</a>; who candidly described the network as a "<a href="mafia">mafia</a>-club." The group began networking during the later days of the <a href="John%20Paul%20II">John Paul II</a> Papacy, attempting to stop the ascent of then Cardinal <a href="Joseph%20Ratzinger">Joseph Ratzinger</a> (later Pope Benedict XVI) as his successor. 

Background.
Jürgen Mettepenningen and Karim Schelkens were the first to discuss the existence of such a grouping of bishops in print in their biography of Cardinal <a href="Godfried%20Danneels">Godfried Danneels</a>; "Godfried Danneels Biographie" (2015). At a press conference in September 2015 promoting the book, Danneels stated that he had been part of a "mafia" like grouping of like-minded cardinals called "Sankt Gallen." This was subsequently reported in the "<a href="National%20Catholic%20Register">National Catholic Register</a>" which claimed, “The group wanted a drastic reform of the Church, to make it ‘much more modern’, and for Cardinal <a href="Jorge%20Bergoglio">Jorge Bergoglio</a> to head it. The group was also said to have comprised Cardinal <a href="Walter%20Kasper">Walter Kasper</a> and the late Jesuit Cardinal <a href="Carlo%20Maria%20Martini">Carlo Maria Martini</a> (who died before the conclave that elected Bergoglio) 

Marco Tosatti, an Italian journalist and Vaticanologist, writing in "<a href="La%20Stampa">La Stampa</a>", wrote much the same, but also mentioned that the autobiography fingered other members, as well as Danneels, Kasper and Martini, as being St. Gallen Group members, also mentioning Dutch Bishop <a href="Ad%20van%20Luyn">Ad van Luyn</a>, the German Cardinal <a href="Karl%20Lehmann">Karl Lehmann</a>, the Italian Cardinal <a href="Achille%20Silvestrini">Achille Silvestrini</a> and British Cardinal <a href="Basil%20Hume">Basil Hume</a>, among others. The group which began as a liberal lobby during the later years of the pontificate of <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> in 1995 and were opposed to the more conservative Cardinal <a href="Joseph%20Ratzinger">Joseph Ratzinger</a>, then Prefect of the <a href="Congregation%20for%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Faith">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a>, ascending to the Papacy afterward. The aforementioned Cardinals who were still active in 2005, along with fellow St. Gallen Group members Cardinal <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Policarpo">José Policarpo</a>, British Cardinal <a href="Cormac%20Murphy-O%27Connor">Cormac Murphy-O'Connor</a> and Ukrainian Cardinal <a href="Lubomyr%20Husar">Lubomyr Husar</a>, attempted to implement their goals at the <a href="Papal%20conclave%2C%202005">Papal conclave, 2005</a>, however, Cardinal Ratzinger was elected Pope Benedict XVI and after Martini proved unsuitable, <a href="Jorge%20Bergoglio">Jorge Bergoglio</a>, an Argentine fellow Jesuit came second. 

The group disbanded in 2006 and stopped their St. Gallen meetings. Before his death in August 2012, Martini suggested a reconciliation between Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Danneels. According to the Jesuit priest who served as Cardinal Montini's confessor, Silvano Fausti, during the so-called "<a href="Vatileaks">Vatileaks</a>" scandal in June 2012, Cardinal Martini had suggested that Pope Benedict XVI retire from office while the two met for the last time before the former's death. In February 2013, when, for the first time in nearly 600 years, the <a href="Resignation%20of%20Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope resigned from his office</a> it meant that a new Papal conclave would take place that year.

Team Bergoglio.
According to <a href="Austen%20Ivereigh">Austen Ivereigh</a>, a Catholic journalist who previously worked as the official spokesman for Cardinal <a href="Cormac%20Murphy-O%27Connor">Cormac Murphy-O'Connor</a> from 2004-2006, in his "The Great Reformer", a gang of four ex-St. Gallen cardinals reorganised as "Team Bergoglio" to advocate the election of Jorge Bergoglio during the <a href="2013%20Papal%20conclave">2013 Papal conclave</a>; Cardinals Kasper, Danneels, Lehmann and Murphy-O'Connor. According to Ivereigh, "They had learned their lesson from 2005 and they first secured Bergoglio’s assent", then "got to work, touring the cardinals dinner to promote their man, arguing that his age should no longer be considered an obstacle, given that Popes could resign." Following the successful election of Bergoglio and the "<a href="Habemus%20Papam">Habemus Papam</a>" (beating out competition from Cardinals <a href="Angelo%20Scola">Angelo Scola</a> and <a href="Marc%20Ouellet">Marc Ouellet</a>), Cardinal Danneels was personally invited by Bergoglio to stand alongside him on the balcony of <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a>, as he was presented as the new Pope.

When the discussion of alleged lobbying by "Team Bergoglio" during the 2013 conclave began to grow in the Catholic media and passages from Ivereigh's book were more widely quoted, the Vatican was pressed for a direct comment by Italian Catholic news blog "Il Sismografo". In December 2014, the Jesuit, <a href="Federico%20Lombardi">Federico Lombardi</a>, who then served as director of the <a href="Holy%20See%20Press%20Office">Holy See Press Office</a> replied. He claimed that all four cardinals "deny this description of the facts, both as much as regards the request of prior consent on the part of Cardinal Bergoglio, and as much as regards the conduction of a campaign for his election, and (that) they desire to be known that they are stupefied and opposed to what has been published." Aside from Cardinal Godfried Danneels' later comments from 2015 onward, the other three Cardinals have not yet spoken publicly on the St. Gallen Group and its alleged legacy in the 2013 conclave.

The series was originally cancelled by <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> in 2013 after airing for two seasons.

Production.
Cancellation.
In January 2013, <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> had meetings with potential clients and promotional partners in which they announced their 2013–14 programming lineup with "<a href="Young%20Justice%20%28TV%20series%29">Young Justice</a>" being absent. A <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Animation">Warner Bros. Animation</a> representative confirmed in an interview with <a href="Newsarama">Newsarama</a> the cancellation of both "Young Justice" and "", with the <a href="DC%20Nation">DC Nation</a> block replacing the series with "<a href="Teen%20Titans%20Go%21%20%28TV%20series%29">Teen Titans Go!</a>" and "<a href="Beware%20the%20Batman">Beware the Batman</a>". While a fan-campaign was created in the hopes of financing continuations for both shows, <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> halted the campaign in May as they didn't believe the goal could be reached.

In December 2013, <a href="Kevin%20Smith">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="Paul%20Dini">Paul Dini</a> claimed in an episode of Smith's podcast "Fat Man on Batman", that "Young Justice" was cancelled due the program's high female viewership, as network executives didn't believe girls would buy toys based on the show. <a href="Greg%20Weisman">Greg Weisman</a> however denied this rumor and in a January 2016 episode of "The Hip-Hop Nerd" podcast, revealed that the show was cancelled due to a deal with toy manufacturing company <a href="Mattel">Mattel</a>. The show's funding was based on a toy deal with the company and due to low toy-sales, Mattel pulled the funding. With no other source of income, the series was effectively canceled.

Revival.
The possibility of "Young Justice" being revived first occurred in early February 2016 when the series was released on <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a>, with Weisman urging fans to watch all episodes "over and over" or buy the <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a>s if they wished for a third season. Weisman later clarified that while neither Warner Bros. or Netflix had expressed interest in picking up the show for a third season, high viewership on Netflix could motivate Warner Bros. into renewing the show. During June, Weisman revealed that the possibility of "Young Justice" being renewed was "very real" but noted that fans needed to keep the show trending in order to convince Warner and Netflix of its potential.

On November 7, 2016, it was officially confirmed by Sam Register, president of Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series, that "Young Justice" was renewed for a third, season stating that the dedicated fanbase and "[its] rallying cry for more episodes" resonated with them. It was also confirmed that Weisman and <a href="Brandon%20Vietti">Brandon Vietti</a> would be returning as showrunners.

Development.
On February 27, 2017, Phil Bourassa, lead character designer of "Young Justice", revealed that he had begun working on the third season. A week later, he revealed that some scripts had already been completed. On April 25, it was revealed that the show's third season would be titled "Young Justice: Outsiders" and would debut in 2018 on <a href="DC%20Comics">DC</a>'s new digital service which would be launching the same year.

In late May, it was revealed that Chris Copeland joined the crew as a storyboard artist. In June, <a href="Nolan%20North">Nolan North</a> (voice of <a href="Superboy%20%28Kon-El%29">Superboy</a>) revealed that five episodes had already been recorded by that point. In July, DC announced that due to "Young Justice: Outsiders" airing on a <a href="streaming%20media">streaming service</a> rather than a <a href="television%20channel">television channel</a>, it will "skew more adult to keep up with the characters as they age".

"Outsiders" had its own panel at <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con">San Diego Comic-Con International</a> 2017 in July 21. During the panel, which was presented by Weisman, Vietti and Bourassa, they revealed that the first 12 scripts had already been finalized, ten were still being written and four more hadn't been started yet; this brought the total number of episodes for "Outsiders" to 26. The teams current roster was also revealed, consisting of: <a href="Static%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Static</a>, <a href="Bart%20Allen">Kid Flash</a>, <a href="Tim%20Drake">Robin</a>, <a href="Wonder%20Girl%20%28Cassie%20Sandsmark%29">Wonder Girl</a>, <a href="Stephanie%20Brown%20%28comics%29">Spoiler</a>, <a href="Jaime%20Reyes">Blue Beetle</a>, <a href="Beast%20Boy">Beast Boy</a>, <a href="Roy%20Harper">Arsenal</a> as well as new characters <a href="Arrowette">Arrowette</a> and <a href="Traci%20Thirteen">Thirteen</a>. It was also revealed that <a href="Dick%20Grayson">Dick Grayson</a>, <a href="Artemis%20Crock">Artemis Crock</a> and <a href="Superboy%20%28Kon-El%29">Superboy</a> would all be returning.

Writing.
When discussing the season three additions to "The Team" and its line-up, Weisman said that while the show would continue to focus on the characters introduced in the first season, they also wanted to introduce new characters as "Young Justice" is "a show about generations". According to Vietti, "Outsiders" will revisit ideas that he and Weisman had originally planned while making the first two season of the show.

Casting.
The first voice actor confirmed to return was <a href="Khary%20Payton">Khary Payton</a> as <a href="Aqualad%20%28Kaldur%27ahm%29">Aqualad</a>.

Release.

Psilocybe Larvae

Psilocybe Larvae is a <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> based band playing <a href="Death-doom">Death-doom</a> metal. Since the formation in 1996 in <a href="Vyborg">Vyborg</a> town.

History.
The story of the band started in 1996 in the Russian city of Vyborg, when Vitaly "Larv" Belobritsky (voc/git), Denis Vinogradov (git), Oleg Peshkichev (bass) and Eugene Ushakov (drums) formed the band to indulge their passion for melodic and haunting death/dark metal.

After recording a first demo, "Liar", in the very same year the band soon entered a professional studio to record a song for the "Russian Alternative Extreme Music" sampler. Drum parts for that song were provided by Ilya "Alan" Piyaev (AZEROTH, PAINFUL MEMORIES) as Eugene decided to leave the band just before recording. The compilation including "Death Is Not the End" was released in 1998.

Following a short interlude with METALLIZATION’s Eugene Golubkov, band finally found a permanent drummer in 1999 when Alan took over drum duties. The new line-up entered the studio again in mid-2000 to record their first full-length "Stigmata". This self-released effort garnered some favourable feedback including the "demo of the month" award in Germany's Legacy magazine, so Black Side Productions decided to re-release "Stigmata" on CD in 2001.

Meanwhile, the band underwent further line-up changes with Andrey replacing Denis on guitars and Den joining the band as keyboardist. 2002 saw Psilocyybe Larvae contributing two cover songs to <a href="MANOWAR">MANOWAR</a> and CHIMERA tributes, but more importantly they finally finished recording their second album. "Agony" was released by Black Side Productions in the beginning of 2003.

The following months dealt another blow to the line-up, when they decided to part ways with Oleg in December 2004, leaving the group without a bass player for quite some time.

A silver lining appeared in 2005 when Russia's major label CD-Maximum agreed to remaster and re-release the two albums with bonus tracks. The band also found a new bass player in Alex "Liga" Legotin but unfortunately there was new trouble ahead: after a few months Alex had to leave the group. Keyboardist Den was fired as well and in autumn 2005 the band was eventually forced to relocate to St. Petersburg - with no stable line-up and lost in what looked like a semi-hiatus, things were slowly falling apart.

What could have been the final nail in the coffin however, surprisingly heralded a new dawn for PL: in St. Petersburg, Alex re-joined the ranks and keyboardist Dmitry "Chaos" Orekhov completed the line-up to release the band from its forced inactivity.

After headlining the Ukrainian "Triple Interaction" tour in autumn 2006, the band entered DDT Records in January 2007 to record their third album, "Non-existence". The effort was mixed at Studio Hertz (Poland), mastered at Cutting Room (Sweden), and finally released in February 2008 by Mazzar Records. In March the band headlined a Russian "Non-existent" tour to support the new album.

During 2008 the band continued to promote "Non-existence" by doing shows in Russia and taking part in a Belarus tour named "Creative Breath of Death" together with <a href="Katalepsy">Katalepsy</a>, <a href="Deathbringer">Deathbringer</a> and THELEMA.

In 2009, PSILOCYBE LARVAE signed to Dark Harvest Records for an international release of "Non-existence" and started songwriting for future releases.

After two years of intensive work Russian metallers returned with a brand new album called “The Labyrinth Of Penumbra”. The recording and mixing process took place at studio Kontakt under the guidance of Yury Smirnov, mastering duties were handled by Mats Lindfors at Cutting Room and cover art was taken care of A-Ra Design and W. Smerdulak.

Time has come to find a new label and in 2012 “The Labyrinth Of Penumbra” was released by Buil2Kill Records/Nadir Music (Italy).

With great success the band played a lot of gigs in Russia, Baltic States and Finland to promote the album.

The beginning of 2013 was marked by the signing of an agreement with Albagi Music Promotion in terms of helping the band with promotion in Germany.

Psilocybe Larvae continued its concert activity in support of the new album; they went on 6 days tour of Belarus "Penumbra Divisus Tour" in February and "Tour By Fire" including 8 cities in Poland and Czech Republic in November. In summer the band took part in the biggest Estonian open-air festival Hard Rock Laager sharing the stage with <a href="Testament">Testament</a>, <a href="Marduk">Marduk</a> and others.

At the same time another line-up changes happened. The band has parted ways with guitarist Andrey "Luke" Lukashkov and drummer Ilya "Alan" Piyaev. Konstantin Kot'h (guitar) and Evgeny "Evg" Trefilov (drums) from industrial metal band VERGELTUNG came on board as the new members.

2014-2015 became very difficult years for the band. Group has again gone through several major line-up changes: the split with Kot’h and Evg, the loss of a ten year member Liga and his comeback after a while, recruiting a new drummer Alexander (MISANTHROPE COUNT MERCIFUL, THARTARIA) and a new guitar player Roman "Dorian" Kondratev (Refawn, Tophet, Monastery Dead).

Due to personal reasons Alexander left PL in 2015 and the band's former drummer Alan has taken up his place behind the drum kit once again.

Thus PSILOCYBE LARVAE now act in their optimum line-up with most devoted members and start working on a new album with renewed forces.

No. 1 (Training) Group RAAF was a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">group</a>. It was formed in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in August 1941 as part of a reorganisation of the air force, and was disbanded after the war in January 1946.

History.
Prior to World War II, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. After war broke out in September 1939, the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure, commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units. Its initial move in this direction was to create Nos. 1 and 2 Groups to control units in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, respectively. Then, between March 1940 and May 1941, the RAAF divided Australia and New Guinea into four <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based command-and-control zones</a>: <a href="Central%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Central Area</a>, <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area</a>, <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area</a>, and <a href="Northern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Area</a>. Each was led by an <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) responsible for the administration and operations of all air bases and units within his boundary. No. 1 Group, which had been established on 20 November 1939, was re-formed as Southern Area Command on 7 March 1940. Headquartered in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Southern Area controlled all Air Force units in Victoria, <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and the southern <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a> district of New South Wales.

By August 1941, the RAAF's expanding instructional program necessitated the establishment of overarching training organisations on a semi-functional, semi-geographical basis. Accordingly, on 2 August 1941, No. 1 (Training) Group was formed in Melbourne to assume responsibility for training units within Southern Area's boundaries. It was commanded by Air Commodore <a href="Raymond%20Brownell">Raymond Brownell</a> until 1 January 1943. Three other training groups were envisaged, but in the event only <a href="No.%202%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">No. 2</a> in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> was formed. As of early 1943, both active training groups reported directly to RAAF Headquarters.

Following the end of the war, No. 1 (Training) Group was disbanded in Melbourne on 29 January 1946.

Aviation in Pennsylvania

<a href="Aviation">Aviation</a> in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> dates back over 100 years. Pennsylvania ranks 11th in the country in the number of public-use aviation facilities with 130 airports, heliports and seaplane bases. The 130 public-use facilities provide an annual economic impact of $23.6 billion to the state. The aviation industry also supports more than 300,000 jobs making it one of the largest employment sectors in the state.

The state has multiple major international airport that connect to state and surrounding areas. <a href="Philadelphia%20International%20Airport">Philadelphia International Airport</a> and <a href="Pittsburgh%20International%20Airport">Pittsburgh International Airport</a> account for a majority of passenger numbers including about three million international travelers to Europe and the Middle East.

History.
<a href="Aviation">Aviation</a> in the <a href="Commonwealth">Commonwealth</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> dates back over 100 years. The state has been in the for front of the aviation development and growth. In the early 1900s the state was home to substantial growth.
Industry beginnings.
After the <a href="Wright%20brothers">Wright brothers</a> first flight the opportunity of flight raced across the nation. Especially in Pennsylvania, many inventors began working on designs for their own flying machines. The public thought flying was abnormal. So these inventors across the state held public air shows to show off their machines to the public and media. Around this time in the 1910s and 1920s many of the states <a href="airports">airports</a> were founded. Thus thrusting the aviation industry into the spotlight across the state.

During war time.
During the World Wars specifically <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> Pennsylvania was designed by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> as training skies for bomber and fighter pilots prior to deployment to Europe or Asia. These bases include <a href="Fort%20Indiantown%20Gap">Fort Indiantown Gap</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh%20Air%20Reserve%20Station">Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station</a> and <a href="Harrisburg%20International%20Airport">Harrisburg International Airport</a>.

Modern commercial aviation.
As jet travel began to become more and more popular, the airline choices expanded as well. The states airport saw record numbers during the 60s and 70s. Massive numbers of aircraft, flights, passengers and airlines at Pennsylvania's airports. Especially at the states two largest airports, <a href="Philadelphia%20International%20Airport">Philadelphia International Airport</a> the largest and the gateway to Europe and <a href="Pittsburgh%20International%20Airport">Pittsburgh International Airport</a> a then hub for <a href="US%20Airways">US Airways</a> a more domestic airport with some flights to <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. All airports saw dramatic rise in flights and passengers in the 70s, 80s and 90s. But after the <a href="September%2011th%20attacks">September 11th attacks</a> much like the rest of the country Pennsylvania's airports saw huge decline in passenger numbers. Thus causing airlines to pull out, such as <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a> in Pittsburgh and <a href="KLM">KLM</a> at Philadelphia's airport.

Continued growth and industry expansion.
Many airports in the commonwealth are seeing growth. In turn, facilities and infrastructure is being updated or constructed. Since 2011 the <a href="FAA">FAA</a> along with local, state and Federal governments allotted almost $1 billions to aviation infrastructure at the states airports. Most predominantly at <a href="Philadelphia%20International%20Airport">Philadelphia International Airport</a>, <a href="Wilkes-Barre/Scranton%20International%20Airport">Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport</a> and <a href="Williamsport%20Regional%20Airport">Williamsport Regional Airport</a>.

It is today a low-cost housing suburb of the City of Plymouth. The 16th century <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> of the Harris family was remodelled in the 18th century and was demolished in 1937. However, various traces of the estate remain, including most notably the <a href="deerpark">deerpark</a>, now a public amenity known as Radford Park, with its large lake, an early 19th century gate-lodge at the entrance drive to the former mansion house, with gatepiers, on Radford Park Road, a bridge and boathouse with <a href="folly%20%28architecture%29">follies</a> of a <a href="sham%20castle">sham castle</a> and another sham-ruin.

The subsequent descent of Radford was as follows:

Francis Harris (1475–1509).
Francis Harris (1475–1509), who married Phillipa Grenville (died 1524), a daughter of Sir <a href="Thomas%20Grenville%20%28died%201513%29">Thomas Grenville</a> (died 1513), <a href="lord%20of%20the%20manor">lord of the manor</a>s of <a href="Bideford">Bideford</a> in Devon and of <a href="Stowe%2C%20Kilkhampton">Stowe</a> in the parish of <a href="Kilkhampton">Kilkhampton</a>, Cornwall, <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Cornwall">Sheriff of Cornwall</a> in 1481 and in 1486.

In 1793 Rev. <a href="John%20Swete">John Swete</a> visited Radford on one of his "Picturesque Tours" and recorded in his Travel Journal:

Thomas Harris.
The occupant of Radford in the 1841 census was Thomas Harris (born 1796), a banker.

Col.Harry Bulteel Harris.
The occupant of Radford in the 1841 census was Col.Harry Bulteel Harris, a partner in the Naval Bank in 1845/6, and his wife Anne (born 1795). In 1818 he was Deputy Adjutant-General of <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> serving under the governorship of Lt-Gen <a href="George%20Ramsay%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Dalhousie">George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie</a>. In 1834 he was created a Knight of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order. In 1838 he retired as Lt-Col of the 93rd Regiment of Foot. He was resident at Radford in the 1851 census.

Bulteel.
Radford was later inherited by a branch of the Bulteel family of <a href="Flete%20House">Flete</a> in the parish of <a href="Holbeton">Holbeton</a>, Devon, which changed its name to Harris-Bulteel. Their tenure ended in debt, fraud and imprisonment. The earliest recorded ancestor of the Bulteel family in England is Samuel Bulteel (died 1682) of <a href="Tavistock%2C%20Devon">Tavistock</a> in Devon, a <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> refugee from France, whose son was James Bulteel (1676–1757) of Tavistock, MP for Tavistock 1703-8 and 1711–15, who married Mary Crocker, daughter and heiress of Courtenay Crocker (died 1740), MP, of <a href="Lyneham%2C%20Yealmpton">Lyneham</a> in the parish of <a href="Yealmpton">Yealmpton</a>, Devon, the last male of the senior branch of the ancient Crocker family. Another possible relative was <a href="John%20Bulteel%20%28died%201669%29">John Bulteel</a> (died 1669), MP for Lostwithiel, Cornwall in 1661 and 1669, a friend of <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a> and secretary to <a href="Edward%20Hyde%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Clarendon">Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon</a>, and cousin of John Bulteel the writer and translator.
James Bulteel inherited the estate of Fleet ("alias" Fleet Damarell), one of the finest estates in Devon, under the will of Richard Hele (died 1709) of Flete, who was no blood relation. James's son was John Bulteel (1733–1801), who in 1757 purchased the estate of <a href="Membland">Membland</a>, in the parish of Holbeton. Membland, in about 1877, and the manor of Revelstoke were purchased by <a href="Edward%20Baring%2C%201st%20Baron%20Revelstoke">Edward Baring</a> (1828–1897), who in 1885 was elevated to the peerage as "<a href="Baron%20Revelstoke">Baron Revelstoke</a> of Membland". He was senior partner of <a href="Barings%20Bank">Barings Bank</a>, which had originated in nearby <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, Devon. In 1861 he had married Louisa Emily Charlotte Bulteel (died 1892), a daughter of <a href="John%20Crocker%20Bulteel">John Crocker Bulteel</a> (1793–1843) of <a href="Flete%20House">Fleet</a>, <a href="Holbeton">Holbeton</a>, the adjoining estate, MP for <a href="South%20Devon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">South Devon</a> 1832–4 and <a href="Sheriff%20of%20Devon">Sheriff of Devon</a> in 1841. Thus the two banking dynasties of Baring and Bulteel, both founded in Devonshire and both destined for ignominious collapse, became linked.

Thomas Bulteel (born 1838).
The occupant of Radford in the 1881 and 1891 censuses was Thomas Bulteel (born 1838), a banker and a partner in the Naval Bank, formerly of 2 Wingfield Villas, Stoke Damerell, where he had resided in 1861 and 1871 with his family and six servants. His wife was Margaret Cork (born 1839). His eldest son was Percy Francis Bulteel (1865-1907), who married Julia Pine-Coffin, of that prominent family long seated at <a href="Portledge%20Manor">Portledge</a> in the parish of <a href="Alwington">Alwington</a>, North Devon. Percy retired from partnership in "Harris, Bulteel & Co" (the Naval Bank) in 1898, when the bank had an undisclosed financial deficiency of £9,295 leaving just two partners remaining: his father Thomas Bulteel and a new partner to replace him, Mackworth Praed Parker (1865-1926) of Moor Cross, Ivybridge, a grandson of Admiral of the Fleet <a href="Sir%20William%20Parker%2C%201st%20Baronet%2C%20of%20Harburn">Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Harburn</a>. From the date of Percy Bulteel's retirement the bank began to be operated recklessly which 16 years later led to its collapse and the destruction of the family's wealth (see below).

Frederick Thomas Bulteel (born 1880).
Frederick Thomas Bulteel (born 1880) of Radford, second son of Thomas Bulteel. In 1914 he was the owner of Radford and a partner in the "Harris, Bulteel & Co" ("alias" Naval Bank) (together with Mackworth Praed Parker) when it became insolvent, having attempted to defraud its customers. In August 1914 the bank suspended payments and executed a deed of arrangement with trustees. Arrangements were made whereby Lloyds Bank "will be prepared to give all possible banking facilities to customers". In November 1915 the two partners were charged with fraud. On 3 November 1915 the "Llais Llafur" Labour Voice newspaper of Wales reported as follows:
Frederick Thomas Bulteel was imprisoned for six months. The insolvent bank was acquired by <a href="Lloyds%20Bank">Lloyds Bank</a>. A certain "Frederick Thomas Bulteel" was killed in action on 7 November 1918 during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, serving as a Lance Corporal in the 47th Anti-Aircraft Searchlight Section, Royal Engineers, and was buried in Abbeville Communal Cemetery Extension, Somme, France. He was resident in the parish of Melplash in Dorset and is named on the war memorial in in Christ Church, Melplash. He married a certain Edith, of Roselands in the parish of Heavitree, near Exeter, Devon.

With the Bulteel's family fortune lost, 
Radford was sold in 1917 by order of the Trustee in Bankruptcy. The sales particulars of the estate listed "Radford House; Hooe Manor (also Belle Vue); Thorn Cottage (in 1851 the seat of Christopher Harris (born 1790), banker, a partner in the Naval Bank); 1 and 2 Furzehatt Villas; farms Higher Goosewell, Lower Goosewell, Barn Farm, Radford Farm; and unsold parts of Buenos Ayres [sic] Building Estate; a total of 602 acres". The purchaser was William Mitchell (1861–1930) The longest-surviving of the sons of Thomas Bulteel of Radford was Hillersden Bulteel (1867-1950), a civil engineer. The Hillersdon family was an ancient gentry family formerly seated at the manor of <a href="Membland">Membland</a>, later a Bulteel seat.

Mitchell.
William Mitchell (1861–1930).
Radford was purchased in 1917 for £11,000 by William ("Billy") A. Mitchell (1861–1930) of Rockville Park, Plymstock, a prominent local corn miller and landowner known as the "Uncrowned King of Plymstock". He let the mansion house to tenants who included Col. Parker and Mrs Jarrett-Bell (widow of the Director of HM Royal Dockyard, Devonport). His last tenants were a married couple formerly employed by him to keep the estate lodge, who later conducted guided tours around the house "enlivened with tales of treasure and tunnels and who probably are most responsible for the legends".

Mitchell died of a heart attack whilst addressing <a href="Devon%20County%20Council">Devon County Council</a> in <a href="Exeter%20Castle">Exeter Castle</a>. Although much of his wealth was donated to charities, Radford was inherited by trustees (his mother and a certain Mr Everson) for his 15-year-old son, W.A. Gordon Mitchell (1915–1968).

W.A. Gordon Mitchell (1915–1968).
Following his inheritance, W.A. Gordon Mitchell (1915–1968) received professional advice that the house was in a dilapidated state and was considered beyond economic repair. Many of the internal fittings and fixtures had been looted or vandalised. The "Western Morning News" newspaper of 27 July 1935 described the house as "a rambling old ruin…falling into a state of irreparable dilapidation…of such a size that no modern landowner would purchase it for his own use…Recently intruders have broken into the house and have damaged the walls and mirrors in an attempt to take away some of the more valuable fittings". Having exhausted all possibilities of saving the structure, in 1937 a team of seven men was employed to demolish the house, which was accomplished in six days, leaving only the gardens, lodges, farms and cottages intact. A modern house, containing a large Elizabethan granite fireplace lintel from the dining room of the old house, was built on the higher end of the estate in the late 1940s, and was named "Radford House". Much of the parkland was sold for housing development, although as the press then reported: "development…will be controlled, and the estate of fine treelands, reaching down to Radford Lake, with the old abbeys, will be preserved intact". In 1956 Gordon Mitchell conveyed the lodges, lake and much of the northern side of the deerpark to Plympton Council for recreational use by the public, which remains largely intact today. In 1960 he sold the remainder for housing development.

Two years later the duo returned as part of the boy group <a href="Got7">Got7</a>. "Verse 2" is the duo's first album after five years. The album contains eight tracks of various genres from pop and alternative rock to hip-hop, adopting lyrical but bright-toned melodies.

Accourding to the duo, they wrote lyrics based on their anxieties going through life in their 20s. The duo also held a photography exhibition to commemorate the release of the new album, which is composed of photographs they have taken, own essays, and unlisted photographs that can be viewed only at the exhibition.

The lead track of the album, "Tomorrow, Today", is co-written by the duo and Park Jin-young, the founder of the label and the duo's producer.

The song features a gentle, percussive rhythm and harmonious melodies and its lyrics highlight the difficulty of making decisions about the future while being tied to the present. The accompanying music video to the song is in line with the song's message and shows JB and Jinyoung traveling in an old car and it closes with the two reading books such as J.D. Salinger’s "<a href="The%20Catcher%20in%20the%20Rye">The Catcher in the Rye</a>", which is a quintessential book for rebellious youth.

<doc id="54770832" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54770832" title="Swiss Militärblachen">
Swiss Militärblachen

Swiss Militärblachen, a kind of Military Tarpaulins (tent cloth) in swissgerman called "Blache", are printed in camouflage tarpaulins. They are used as rain protection, as elements in bivouac and for camouflaging military equipment. They are specially treated and therefore water repellent and highly resistant to abrasion and dirt. In Germany and Austria the military is also known as "multi-purpose Plane". This, however, is different from the <a href="Swiss%20military">Swiss military</a> Militärblachen, trapezoida.

The official name is the Swiss army tent 01 and tent 64, the number is in each case for the year of introduction (1901 and 1964). The two models differ in camouflage and part in fastening the buttons. They are sewn or riveted to the Militärblachen, very old models wearing the buttons on a strong string attached such that a button can be used on both sides - to the knob to the cord is pulled through the loop to the opposite side.

Older Militärblachen have on one side the <a href="Swiss%20Military%20TAZ%2083">Swiss Military TAZ 83</a> camopattern, the new ones have on both sides a green camo pattern, who is not similar to the <a href="Swiss%20Military%20TAZ%2090">Swiss Military TAZ 90</a> patern.

The Swiss Militärblache is square and has a side length of 165 centimeters. It consists of chemically modified Cotton and has reinforced seams, giving it a very high tensile strength. Along the edges are 3 2buttonholes and 64 Aluminium buttons installed in double rows, making it possible to connect two Militärnlachen. In every Militärblache is a removable tent cord who is two meters long incorporated a 60 cm long "neck strap" and four corner and center ribs. In the corners are each a strong metal eyelet as a holder for a tent pole. The dry Militärblache weighs 1.25 kg.

At any Swiss Militärblache has a peg bag ("Zelteinheit"). This includes three pegs made from aluminum or steel, depending on the version and either three pegs of wood (each 40.5 cm, composed of 110 cm long) or four longer and a shorter tent poles made of aluminum.

Damaged Militärblachen were identified earlier in a corner with a yellow color and referred to as "B-Blache" or "reject Militärblache". Today, both sides are all camouflaged tent cloths as "Ausschussblachen" reject Militärblachen, since the newer only on one side have <a href="Camouflage">Camouflage</a>.

The Militärblachen served in the army as rain protection, for camouflage and bivouac. By skillfully combining several different Tarpaulins tents can be manufactured in different sizes and shapes. In this use, they are especially for youth organizations (Scouts, CEVI, Jungwacht, blue ring, BESJ and others) popular.
Swiss Militärblachen with the TAZ 83 Pattern are still in Use in the Swiss Military along with Militärblachen with a green camo pattern (who is not the same pattern like the TAZ 90).

Bruce Helander (born January 27, 1947) is an <a href="United%20States">American</a> artist associated with <a href="collage">collage</a> and <a href="assemblage%20%28art%29">assemblage</a>. He lives and works in <a href="West%20Palm%20Beach">West Palm Beach</a>.

Early life and education.
Helander was born in <a href="Great%20Bend%2C%20Kansas">Great Bend</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, to Amos and Carmen Helander. His mother was an interior designer whose eccentric styles inspired him to go on and become an artist. He studied <a href="painting">painting</a> and went on to graduate from the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20School%20of%20Design">Rhode Island School of Design</a> with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Bachelor of Fine Arts</a> in 1969 and a <a href="Master%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Master of Fine Arts</a> in 1972. While attending college, Paul Clay and Sewell Sillman became major influence in Helander's early life. 
After graduating, Helander began his career at RISD as a Director of Admissions, eventually becoming the Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs. During his tenure there, Helander became a <a href="White%20House%20Fellows">White House fellow</a> at the <a href="National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Arts">National Endowment for the Arts</a>. Leaving Academia in 1979, Helander became the editor and publisher of the Art Express magazine. 

Work.
Bruce Helander is an art critic, art dealer, arts writer, curator, and artist whose specialty is <a href="collage">collage</a> and <a href="assemblage%20%28art%29">assemblage</a>. He began his career as an art dealer when he opened the Helander Gallery. 
The Helander Gallery was founded in 1982 and had its first home at Worth Avenue. In 1986 it expanded to include another Palm Beach location and in 1989 it added a new site in New York’s <a href="SoHo">SoHo</a> district.

Helander Gallery quickly rose to prominence opening with such artists as: <a href="Dale%20Chihuly">Chihuly</a>, <a href="Robert%20Rauschenberg">Rauschenberg</a>, and <a href="Italo%20Scanga">Scanga</a>. In 1988 Helander brought together <a href="John%20Chamberlain">John Chamberlain</a>, <a href="Duane%20Hanson">Duane Hanson</a>, <a href="Jules%20Olitski">Jules Olitski</a>, Robert Rauschenberg, and <a href="James%20Rosenquist">James Rosenquist</a> creating the Five Floridians exhibition. Later that year the polyvinyl sculpture by <a href="John%20DeAndrea">John DeAndrea</a>, Sphinx, was displayed. The sculpture, a lifelike nude woman, brought about controversy over the appropriateness of a publicly displayed nude sculpture.

Helander Gallery became known for selling works by eponymous artists such as Dale Chihuly, Duane Hanson, Robert Rauschenberg, and <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>. 

"Erotica".
Helander depicts both the ecstasy and complications of sex in his collages as a means of enhancing the realism in his art. The evocative images contain multiple fragments of parts that rotate around the blank space.

"Dreams".
Helander recaptures dreams or expresses content in such a way that they can be interpreted as dreams. Headlessness is characteristic of this series – the heads of the figures depicted are substituted for other images in order to portray the entry into a dream state.

"Cartoons".
Helander uses Cartoon elements in his collages to add comic spice to the iconographic level of meaning. The presence of these images is prominent enough to sway the tone towards popular imagery without becoming Pop Art itself, rather. Helander creates a tone pointing towards the eccentric and personal content found in small motifs. 

"Eccentric Landscapes".
Helander makes use of map fragments and meteorological references to create collages that become veritable landscapes. These works capture the legends of travelers and explorers as they enriched the escapist dimension of the American dream.

"Love Letters".
In his series "Love Letters", Helander reflects on his love for letterforms and a sense of humor with multiple meanings. The series centers the primary letterform and surrounds it in a nostalgic composition of vintage images and rich colors.

"Commissions".
Helander has taken commissions from the <a href="Norton%20Museum%20of%20Art">Norton Museum of Art</a>, <a href="Dan%20Marino">Dan Marino</a>, and the <a href="World%20Federation%20of%20United%20Nations%20Associations">World Federation of the United Nations Associations</a>. Other commissions include works for Dale Chihuly and Cutrale. 

From 1993 until 2000, Helander created custom collage illustrations for the <a href="The%20New%20Yorker">New Yorker</a> section "Goings On About Town". Beginning in 2002 Helander contributed collage illustrations for Jazziz Magazine, including numerous covers and CD jacket designs. For 10 years, since its inception, Helander was commissioned by the <a href="Palm%20Beach%20International%20Film%20Festival">Palm Beach International Film Festival</a> to create limited edition film festival posters which became noteworthy amongst local attendees.

"Curious Collage".
In 1994 Robert Mahoney, art critic and contributor to <a href="ARTnews">ARTnews</a> magazine, wrote the artist's book "Curious Collage: Bruce Helander". Published by Grassfield Press, Curious Collage included and introduction by <a href="Henry%20Geldzahler">Henry Geldzahler</a>, notable art critic, curator, and art historian.

"The Art Economist".
Helander was the editor-in-chief of The Art Economist, a publication that examined the contemporary art market. A critically informative publication serving as a constructive tool for art collectors, museums and galleries, The Art Economist was used to ascertain transparency of art value in the global contemporary art market.

Curating.
Helander acted as curator of Cuadro Fine Art Gallery, Dubai in 2007. Since 2012 Helander has served as a guest curator at ArtHouse429, Palm Beach. He has also served as guest curator of the <a href="Coral%20Springs%20Museum%20of%20Art">Coral Springs Museum of Art</a>.

Exhibitions.
His work is in over fifty museum collections, including the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, <a href="Solomon%20R.%20Guggenheim%20Museum">Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</a>, <a href="Brooklyn%20Museum">Brooklyn Museum</a>, <a href="Smithsonian">Smithsonian</a>, <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20Museum%20of%20Art">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a>, <a href="Whitney%20Museum%20of%20American%20Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a> and the <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles</a>.

Recognition.
Helander is a former White House fellow of the National Endowment for the Arts and has won the South Florida Cultural Consortium fellowship for professional achievement in the visual arts. In 2014 he was inducted to the <a href="Florida%20Artists%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Florida Artists Hall of Fame</a>, Florida’s most prestigious arts and culture honor.

Polydora ciliata

Polydora ciliata is a species of annelid worm in the family <a href="Spionidae">Spionidae</a>, commonly known as a bristleworm. It is a burrowing worm and is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and some other parts of the world. 

Taxonomy.
"Polydora ciliata" was first described in 1838 by the Scottish physician and naturalist <a href="George%20Johnston%20%28naturalist%29">George Johnston</a> as "Leucodore ciliatus", but was later placed in the genus "<a href="Polydora">Polydora</a>". A planktonic organism was described as "Metadasydytes quadrimaculatus" in 1971 by <a href="Roch%20Roszczak">Roch Roszczak</a>, who placed it in the phylum <a href="Gastrotrich">Gastrotrich</a>a; it was later established that the animal he was describing was in fact the larval stage of a spionid worm, probably "Polydora ciliata".

Description.
The species can grow to a length of about with around 180 segments. The front of the <a href="prostomium">prostomium</a> (head) has no eyes or <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a>, but the hind part has a pair of long palps and up to four eyes. The multi-segmented body is broadest fairly near the front and then tapers gradually to the <a href="pygidium">pygidium</a> (terminal segment) which bears a funnel. Each segment bears <a href="Parapodium">parapodia</a> (outgrowths) and <a href="chaeta">chaeta</a>e (bristles), the ventral branches of the parapodia being triangular or finger-like, and these structures reducing in size towards the rear of the animal. On segment five, the bristles are specially modified for burrowing. <a href="Gill">Gill</a>s are present on all the segments beyond 7 except for the last 10 to 20 segments.

Distribution and habitat.
"P. ciliata" has a widespread distribution round the coasts of northwestern Europe. As a burrowing species, it tunnels into limestone; chalk and clay, <a href="Lithothamnion">calcareous algae</a>, the <a href="holdfast">holdfast</a>s of seaweeds, wood, muddy sediment and <a href="Mollusca">mollusc</a> shells, including those of <a href="oyster">oyster</a>s, <a href="mussel">mussel</a>s and <a href="Littorinidae">periwinkles</a>. It is also known from the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, the Indo-Pacific and Antarctica.

Ecology.
The burrow of "P. ciliata" is U-shaped, and the presence of these worms can be recognised by the sets of small, double perforations they make. The worm is believed to burrow by abrading the substrate with its bristly chaetae, but there may also be some chemical action involved in burrowing. The tube is lined with <a href="mucus">mucus</a> and fine grains of sediment and extends slightly above the surrounding material. When feeding, the worm extends its head out of the tube and uses its two long palps to feed on <a href="detritus">detritus</a>. It has been observed feeding on dead <a href="barnacle">barnacle</a>s and other small dead <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, and can also <a href="Filter%20feeder">filter</a> plankton from the water.

The worms are either male or female; sperm is liberated into the <a href="water%20column">water column</a> and drawn into the burrow of the female by means of the respiratory current. Up to 60 eggs are enclosed in a capsule, and several capsules are suspended by threads inside the female's tube. The eggs hatch in about one week and are <a href="plankton">plankton</a>ic for up to six weeks before settling. When the worms bore into the shells of oysters, mussels and periwinkles, they do not feed on the mollusc's soft parts, but they weaken the shell and make the mollusc more vulnerable to attack by <a href="crab">crab</a>s and other <a href="Predation">predators</a>.

George Levinger

George Levinger (born on February 5, 1927 in Berlin, Germany; died July 3, 2017 in Amherst, Massachusetts) was Professor of Psychology at the <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Amherst">University of Massachusetts in Amherst</a>. He received his B.A. from <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> in 1946. After his army service in Tokyo and time in the import-export business, he received a 1951 M.A. in clinical psychology from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> and a 1955 Ph.D. in social psychology from the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>. He later taught at <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr College</a> (1957-60), <a href="Western%20Reserve%20University">Western Reserve University</a> (1960-65), and the <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts">University of Massachusetts</a> (1965-92).

Professional Work.
His reputation as a social scientist is built primarily on his research and theory regarding close interpersonal relationships. After publishing various papers on marital relationships, he sought to link his work to previous social psychological findings about short-term superficial relationships in the laboratory. In 1972 he authored the widely cited paper, "Attraction in relationship: A new look at interpersonal attraction," which distinguished explicitly between surface contact and a deepening mutuality. As two partners become increasingly interdependent and concerned with each other, their mutual involvement is pictured by a growing intersection between two circles or mutual "life spaces." This image applied to any sort of close relationship -- whether a courtship, a friendship, or a business partnership. The framework helped to spawn a research literature and debate on the multifaceted nature and measurement of mutuality (aka closeness) and the factors that promote its development, on the one hand, and undermine it, on the other. In 1974, he organized an interdisciplinary conference on close relationships at the University of Massachusetts, resulting in the book "Close Relationships".

Two other papers on pair "cohesiveness" proposed a model for explaining why some couples stay together even though partners find themselves in an "empty-shell" relationship. Two years later, he edited a book on breakups: "Divorce and Separation: Context, Causes, and Consequences". 

In contributing to the subsequent multi-authored theoretical book "Close Relationships", Levinger's chapter on "Development and change" focused on the longitudinal sequence from Acquaintance to Buildup to Continuation to possible Deterioration and Ending, and the transitions between those phases. This "A-B-C-D-E" model and analysis among its transitions is a tool for viewing changes in couple relationships in general.

In 1990, the International Society for the Study of Personal Relationships gave Levinger its first Distinguished Career Contribution Award.

He led his people in taking arms in defence of <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Canada%20Rebellion">Upper Canada Rebellion</a>, oversaw the sale of the bulk of their territory to the provincial government, and led them in their first attempts to adopt an agrarian way of life. Although the claims of several other persons have been advanced, it is generally believed (not necessarily correctly) that Musquakie is the origin of the name of the <a href="District%20Municipality%20of%20Muskoka">District Municipality of Muskoka</a>.

Early Life and Military Service.
Musquakie's father, <a href="Yellow%20Head%20of%20Lake%20Simcoe">Yellow Head</a>, preceded him as "head chief". After Yellow Head persuaded the <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a> of the <a href="Home%20District">Home District</a> of Upper Canada to side with the British during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, Musquakie saw action under his father at the <a href="Battle%20of%20York">Battle of York</a> in April 1813, where Musquakie sustained a facial injury from a musket ball. Yellow Head too was wounded at York, sustaining wounds of such severity that the remainder of his career was curtailed. Musquakie had taken over his father's duties by 1815, and in 1817 he formally succeeded Yellow Head as head chief.

Land Purchases.
The early years of Musquakie's chiefship were dominated by treaty negotiations and land purchases. In 1815, as acting chief in his father's place, he participated along with <a href="John%20Aisance">John Aisance</a> and another chief in the <a href="Lake%20Simcoe%E2%80%93Lake%20Huron%20Purchase">Lake Simcoe–Lake Huron Purchase</a>, surrendering to the provincial government 250,000 acres of territory lying between the north shore of <a href="Kempenfelt%20Bay">Kempenfelt Bay</a> and <a href="Georgian%20Bay">Georgian Bay</a> (present-day North <a href="Simcoe%20County">Simcoe</a>). In 1818, having succeeded his father the previous year, he and four other chiefs surrendered a further 1,600,000 acres of territory to the government. The area encompassed by this <a href="Lake%20Simcoe%E2%80%93Nottawasaga%20Purchase">Lake Simcoe–Nottawasaga Purchase</a> included the watersheds of the <a href="Holland%20River">Holland</a> and <a href="Nottawasaga%20River">Nottawasaga</a> rivers, as well as adjoining areas. Notwithstanding the surrender of this vast swathe of land, representing most of their remaining territory, Musquakie and his people reserved the right under the purchase agreement to continue to range and hunt there.

Settlement Attempt at Atherley Narrows.
In 1828, Musquakie, Aisance and their people reportedly "expressed a strong desire to be admitted to Christianity, and to adopt the habits of civilized life". They converted to <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a> later that year (Musquakie would later become an <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a>). In 1830, Musquakie and Aisance were induced by Lieutenant Governor <a href="John%20Colborne%2C%201st%20Baron%20Seaton">John Colborne</a> and his agents to settle their people permanently in two purpose-built villages, one at Atherley Narrows between Lakes Simcoe and <a href="Lake%20Couchiching">Couchiching</a>, where Musquakie himself settled, and the other at <a href="Severn%2C%20Ontario">Coldwater</a>, where Aisance settled. The house built for Musquakie by the government at the Narrows, like that of Aisance at Coldwater, was the only frame house in a village otherwise made up of log houses, in recognition of his chiefly status..

As late as 1835, Colborne's agents considered that this settlement experiment was succeeding. However, Aisance was unhappy, and the change in government in 1836, which saw <a href="Francis%20Bond%20Head">Francis Bond Head</a> replace Colborne as Lieutenant Governor, soon brought the experiment to an end. Partly in response to petitions submitted by white settlers at <a href="Orillia%2C%20Ontario">Orillia</a> and Coldwater, Bond Head opened talks with Musquakie and Aisance and persuaded them, along with three other chiefs including Thomas Naingishkung and Big Shilling, to leave the Simcoe-Coldwater corridor (which remained Crown land) in return for one-third of the proceeds of the anticipated sales of lots there to European settlers. In 1842, Musquakie and Aisance, along with Naingishkung, Big Shilling, <a href="Joseph%20Snake">Joseph Snake</a> and another chief, wrote to Governor General <a href="Charles%20Bagot">Charles Bagot</a> protesting that Bond Head had not fully explained the 1836 purchase agreement, and had, in particular, not made it clear that it did not involve an upfront, lump-sum payment, nor that the Ojibwe would receive only one-third of the sale proceeds. At their request, the proceeds of the piecemeal sales of lots in the Simcoe-Coldwater corridor were subsequently banked so that the Ojibwe could receive an annual income from the interest, to be divided three ways between Musquakie's band, Aisance's band and Snake's band on the islands of Lake Simcoe.

Upper Canada Rebellion.
Towards the end of 1838, Bond Head called the Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe to arms to help in keeping the peace in the wake of the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837-38. Musquakie dutifully assembled his warriors, abandoning the autumn hunt in the process, and led them to an encampment at <a href="Holland%20Landing%2C%20Ontario">Holland Landing</a>. They were soon dismissed, at which they complained "most bitterly" to government agents that the small stipend paid to them for this brief period of service was too little to offset the economic blow of having been compelled to abandon their hunting. In response to this outcry, the government approved the payment of rations to the Ojibwe until the end of February 1839.

Settlement at Rama.
Bond Head's call to arms had followed on the heels of the relocation of Musquakie and his band from the Narrows to a new settlement at <a href="Mnjikaning%20First%20Nation%2032">Rama</a>, established in 1838 on a tract of land the Ojibwe had purchased for themselves on the eastern shores of Lake Couchiching. Thomas Naingishkung and Big Shilling and their followers accompanied Musquakie to Rama. The settlement they built there is now the main reserve of the <a href="Chippewas%20of%20Rama%20First%20Nation">Chippewas of Rama First Nation</a>. The situation at Rama ensured that Musquakie's last years were difficult ones. From the outset the Rama settlers were under considerable pressure from their creditors; in 1839, Musquakie, Naingishkung and Big Shilling wrote to the government that they were relying on that year's hunt to enable them "to pay our debts to those we have been so long owing", presumably white traders for the most part. Although the Chippewas of Rama still reserved the right to hunt across the extensive territory their chiefs had sold in 1815 and 1818, by 1838 European settlement was putting pressure on the game population, and the Ojibwe were also "obliged frequently to submit to irritating and extremely unjust Treatment on the Part of the neighbouring White Settlers". The settlement built for them at Rama by Bond Head's agents proved to be "badly constructed": by 1858, the buildings were reportedly "all going to decay". Musquakie complained to the Methodist leaders that their missionaries living and working at Rama were indifferent to educating his people and encouraging disobedience to the chiefs. Despite a promising start, the Ojibwe's commitment to farming fizzled out as government supervision waned in the 1840s and 1850s, and lack of production increased their debt troubles. Already by the time of his death, Musquakie had had a glimpse of the grave future challenges his people would face.

Death.
Having reached very advanced years—exactly how many is disputed—Musquakie died on 11 January 1864. In his will (which the government did not regard as legally binding), he appointed his nephew Isaac Yellowhead his heir and successor as "Head Chief of the Chippewa tribe of Indians", but it was Thomas Naingishkung's son, Joseph Benson Naingishkung, who was chosen to succeed him by his people.

Written and directed by Esteban Bravo and Beth David, the project was funded through <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> where it racked up a total of $14,191 from 416 backers on a goal of $3,000. The short film concerns a closeted boy who has a crush on another boy and his heart's desire to be with him. The short has received wide praise on various platforms.

Plot.
Sherwin, a shy ginger haired boy, arrives at school awaiting the arrival of the handsome Jonathan. Sherwin hides in a tree and watches as Jonathan walks by reading a book and eating an apple. Suddenly, Sherwin's heart begins to beat rapidly and becomes <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a>, leaving his body and chasing after Jonathan. Sherwin attempts to grab and hide his heart resulting in various awkward encounters with Jonathan. Eventually, Sherwin chases his heart inside the school and grabs it. Then the heart grabs Jonathan's finger. The situation becomes uncomfortable as other students see the two and look on in disdain. The heart breaks in two and Sherwin runs away with one half. Outside the school, Sherwin sits solemnly when Jonathan walks up and sits next to him. They join the heart back together and it happily springs to life. The scene fades to black with Sherwin and Jonathan's hearts glowing and they form into one.

Production.
Production on the short started in January 2016, when Esteban Bravo and Beth David were approached by a friend to produce a short film about a boy's heart popping out of their chest. The initial pitch featured a boy and a girl, but at the last minute decided to switch it to a same-sex couple in order to make the story feel "more personal". They made a Kickstarter page in November 2016 to complete the film and earned more than enough of the requested amount. A trailer was released on May 17, 2017 and the short film was released on July 31, 2017.

<doc id="54772497" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54772497" title="Abbey of Blanche-Couronne">
Abbey of Blanche-Couronne

The Abbey of Our Lady of Blanche-Couronne ("Abbaye Notre-Dame de Blanche-Couronne") is a former <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> and <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> abbey located in <a href="La%20Chapelle-Launay">La Chapelle-Launay</a> in the <a href="Departments%20of%20France">department</a> of <a href="Loire-Atlantique">Loire-Atlantique</a> in France.

History.
The abbey is situated on a rocky prominence above a floodplain of an arm of the Loire River. During its heyday, it controlled the revenues of a number of priories and other properties.

Some historians hold that the abbey was founded in 1160 for sixteen monks who migrated from another abbey. The earliest documented date for the abbey is 1161, with a reference to "Ernaud, abbot of Blanche-Couronne" in documents pertaining to a property dispute.

In 1234, a papal bull issued by <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20IX">Pope Gregory IX</a> conferred special privileges on the abbey and put it under the "<a href="Benedictine">rule of Saint Benedict</a> and the institution of the <a href="Cistercians">Cistercians</a>". In 1236, the abbot asked for the abbey to be affiliated with the Cistercians, and in 1336, a new papal bull from <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XI">Pope Benedict XI</a> placed it under the Cistercians. Then in 1410, the French Pope <a href="Antipope%20John%20XXIII">John XXIII</a> placed it under the Benedictines.

Starting in the 16th century, a series of <a href="commendatory%20abbots">commendatory abbots</a> — often laymen appointed by the king but also prelates like <a href="Jean%2C%20Cardinal%20of%20Lorraine">Jean, Cardinal of Lorraine</a> — began the financial ruination of the abbey. The abbey underwent a revival in the early-mid 18th century, when the Benedictines repaired the chapel (1719) and rebuilt some of the buildings (1743). Nonetheless, by 1767 it was down to 4 monks and was shortly thereafter abandoned. During the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> it was nationalized and in 1791 it was sold to René Vigneron, a lawyer and director of the nearby <a href="Departments%20of%20France">department</a> of the <a href="Vend%C3%A9e">Vendée</a>.

By 1815, it was in the possession of the Laval family. In 1841, it became the property of the Lecadres, a prosperous French merchant family. In the late 19th century it was inherited by Marie Lecadre, the wife of the painter <a href="Auguste%20Toulmouche">Auguste Toulmouche</a>, and it became a gathering place for Parisian artists and musicians.

In 1922, the department acquired it with an eye to setting up an insane asylum, but this plan never came to fruition. Reprivatized in 1929, it was occupied first by the English and then by the Germans during World War II.

In 1978, an association was formed to preserve the abbey for the future. By then, it was in very bad repair, with several roofless areas (the abbey choir, the east wing). In 1994, the abbey was classified as a national historic monument and restoration efforts have continued in the years since.

Architecture.
The abbey's columns and capitals date back to the 12th century. The chapter house dates from the 12th to the 18th centuries. The old cloister dates back to the 12th century, while the frescoes date from the 14th century. 
The south façade has a carving of the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of Jean Briçonnet, vice-chancellor of Brittany and the abbey's first commendatory abbot. In the 19th century, this coat of arms was painted in one of the abbey rooms by <a href="Jules-%C3%89lie%20Delaunay">Jules-Élie Delaunay</a>, who also painted some large murals.

List of artworks in the Gonzaga collection

The Gonzaga Collection or "Celeste Gallery"' ("la Celeste Galeria") was the large collection of artworks commissioned and acquired by the <a href="House%20of%20Gonzaga">House of Gonzaga</a> in <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>, exhibited for a time in the <a href="Palazzo%20Ducale%20%28Mantua%29">Palazzo Ducale</a>, the <a href="Palazzo%20Te">Palazzo Te</a>, the <a href="Palazzo%20San%20Sebastiano">Palazzo San Sebastiano</a> and other buildings in Mantua and elsewhere.

The Gonzagas were inspired by the <a href="wunderkammer">wunderkammer</a> style of collecting practised by the princes of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, with <a href="Isabella%20d%27Este">Isabella d'Este</a> in particular creating a noted private 'studiolo'. They set an example for other European courts, particularly in their patronage of contemporary artists, whilst their collecting increased the international profile of Mantua, a relatively small state. It reached its peak under <a href="Vincenzo%20I%20Gonzaga">Vincenzo I Gonzaga</a> and his son <a href="Ferdinando%20Gonzaga">Ferdinando</a> , before the family's decline led to major losses from the collection, such as the long negotiations from 1625 onwards with <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">Charles I of Great Britain</a>, mediated by the Flemish art dealer <a href="Daniel%20Nys">Daniel Nys</a>. These culminated in 1627 with most of the Gonzaga collections being sent to London. This ensured their preservation, unlike the artworks still in Mantua when the <a href="Sack%20of%20Mantua">city was sacked</a> in 1630.

Its works are now split between museums and private collections across the world, as shown by the 2002-2003 exhibition "Gonzaga. La Celeste Galeria. Il Museo dei Duchi di Mantova" at the Palazzo Te and Palazzo Ducale, which included around ninety paintings from the total of approximately 2000 originally in the collection. As well as paintings, the collection also included decorative work in gold and precious stones such as the <a href="Gonzaga%20Cameo">Gonzaga Cameo</a> along with natural history specimens or 'mirabilia'.

The park is flanked by two of Condado's landmark hotels: to the west by the <a href="Condado%20Vanderbilt%20Hotel">Condado Vanderbilt Hotel</a> (1919), designed by Warren and Whitmore, and to the east by the La Concha Hotel (1957), designed by <a href="Toro%20Ferrer">Toro Ferrer</a>. The 1.8 hectare public space was developed by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Tourism Company, and has been credited as one of the principal motors steering the district's urban revitalisation. 

Designed by Puerto Rican architect and urbanist <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Mignucci">Andrés Mignucci</a>, La Ventana al Mar has won numerous awards for design excellence including awards in the American Institute of Architects Puerto Rico Chapter Design Awards, the Puerto Rico Architecture Biennale, the Miami + Beach Architecture Biennale (Bronze Medal) and the Iberoamerican Architecture Biennale. In 2016, La Ventana al Mar was exhibited at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin as part of the Demo:polis–the Right to Public Space exhibit. 

The project includes a large ornamental fountain designed in collaboration with Wet Design of Los Angeles and two public space sculptures by artist <a href="%C3%81ngel%20Botello">Ángel Botello</a>. The park has been the site for music festivals like "La Ventana al Jazz" and weekend markets and fairs.

The public space occupies the site of the old Condado Convention Center built in the 1970's and became one of the components of the controversial Condado Trio project. El Condado was built over decades with private hotels, apartments and high rise condominiums so that access to the beach and view of the ocean was only possible under difficult circumstances. In the late 1990's the three choice properties on Ashford Avenue - the Convention Center and the Vanderbilt and La Concha Hotels were closed and in state of disrepair. The Government of Puerto Rico proposed remodelling the Vanderbilt Hotel and demolishing the Condado Convention Center and La Concha. The Government awarded the project's development to a US-based hotel consortium which proposed to build an all-inclusive hotel and condominium resort at this location. The case became a political issue and was the subject of protests and challenges by the local community, the College of Architects and the Municipality of San Juan. Finally a counter-project proposed by the Municipality of San Juan based on the revitalisation of the two landmark hotels and the creation of a central public space, La Ventana al Mar, was approved and constructed.

Working from her background in textile and fabric art and design, Agha uses a combination of textile processes such as embroidery, wax, dyes, and silk-screen printing within her drawings and paintings. She creates patterns based off of ancient <a href="Islamic%20geometric%20patterns">Islamic geometric patterns</a> and <a href="Islamic%20interlace%20patterns">Islamic interlace patterns through</a> hand cutting, laser cutting, and sewing on paper. She uses embroidery as a drawing method to bridge the gap between modern materials and historical patterns of traditional oppression and domestic servitude. She questions the gendering of textile work as domesticated and its exclusion of it being considered an art form.

Installation.
In 2013 Agha started to explore working with light and shadow, in her piece 'Intersections', a 6.5' laser-cut wood cube encasing a light bulb, she pushed the binaries of public and private, light and shadow, and static and dynamic by relying on the symmetry of geometric design and the interpretation of the cast shadows. The walls of the cube showcase Moorish patterns inspired from the <a href="Alhambra">Alhambra</a>,a place where Islamic and Christian worlds intersect. Growing up as a girl in Pakistan, Agha was not allowed to visit the mosques because of her gender. It was from these memories of exclusion and of visiting the Alhambra that Agha started to think about all the problems that arise because of exclusion and wanted to create something that would include all, regardless of race, gender, and ethnicity.
Awards and recognition.
Agha’s work has been exhibited in solo and group shows across the USA and in countries as far reaching as United Arab Emirates, India, and Spain. She is currently being represented by Aicon Art Gallery in New York City and <a href="Talley%20Dunn%20Gallery">Talley Dunn Gallery</a>, Dallas, TX. Along with winning <a href="ArtPrize">Artprize</a> Agha has also been the recipient of other awards such as the Efroymson Arts Fellowship (2009), an IAHI grant

The final voyage.
On 10 January 1920, in the early morning, "Afrique", liner of the Compagnie des Chargeurs Réunis started its voyage on the Gironde channel with 609 people on board (crew and passengers). It headed for Dakar and the other ports of the French West Coast, its usual line. This was its 58th trip. It sank in the early hours of January 12, 1920, to the northeast edge of the Rochebonne plateau, less than 23 miles (42 km) from Olonne.

The Sinking.
At about 11:58 pm on January 12, 1920, "Afrique" passed between Pierre Levée and the Plateau de Rochebonne. It lost engine power. The weather made it hard to repair the engines and it drifted onto a reef and got stuck. The weather made a gash in the hull and the Afrique started to sink. Because of the terrible weather ships that answered the distress calls couldn't help. On January 13, 1920 at 3 o'clock, "Afrique" lost all contact with other ships and soon after sank. Only 34 survivors were collected of 135 crew and 474 passengers.

Hasan Nizami

Hasan Nizami was a <a href="Persian%20language">Persian language</a> poet and historian, who lived in the 12th and 13th centuries. He migrated from <a href="Nishapur">Nishapur</a> to <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> in India, where he wrote "Tajul-Ma'asir", the first official history of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>.

Early life.
Little is known about the family background of Hasan Nizami, since neither him nor his contemporaries provide any such information. The later historians such as <a href="M%C4%ABr-Khv%C4%81nd">Mīr-Khvānd</a>, <a href="Abu%27l-Fazl%20ibn%20Mubarak">Abu'l-Fazl</a> and <a href="K%C3%A2tip%20%C3%87elebi">Kâtip Çelebi</a> call him "Sadru-din Muhammad bin Hasan Nizami". <a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Ziauddin Barani</a> calls him "Sadr-i-Nizami". According to the 14th century Persian <a href="Hamdallah%20Mustawfi">Hamdallah Mustawfi</a>, Nizami was a son of Persian poet <a href="Nizami%20Aruzi">Nizami Aruzi</a>, but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim.

Nizami originally lived in <a href="Nishapur">Nishapur</a>, in the <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khorasan</a> region of present-day <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. When the region became unsafe because of the <a href="Khwarazmian%20dynasty">Khwarazmian</a>-<a href="Ghurid%20dynasty">Ghurid</a> conflict, Nizami visited the <a href="Imam%20Reza%20shrine">Imam Reza shrine</a> and sought advice from his religious preceptor Muhammad Kufi. Kufi advised him to leave Nishapur and migrate to India.

During his journey to India, Nizami fell ill at <a href="Ghazna">Ghazna</a>. He recovered under the care of Shaikh Muhammad Shirazi and Majd-al-Mulk, who held the office of "Sadr-i-Jahan". The fact that these important officials extended their hospitality to Nizami indicates that he was either a reputed scholar or came from a reputed family.

While in Ghazna, Nizami heard that the <a href="Qutb%20al-Din%20Aibak">Qutb al-Din Aibak</a>, the Ghurid governor of <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, was generous towards immigrants. He, therefore, decided to try his luck in Delhi.

"Tajul-Ma'asir".
Nizami arrived in Delhi, sometime before the assassination of the Ghurid king <a href="Muhammad%20of%20Ghor">Muhammad of Ghor</a> in 1206. Nizami initially stayed with Sharaful-Mulk, who held the office of "Sadr" in Delhi. When Nizami was looking for employment, his friends suggested that he compile a history of the Muslim conquest of India, highlighting the achievements of Qutb al-Din Aibak. Soon after the Ghurid king's death, Qutb al-Din became the first ruler of the independent <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>, and issued a <a href="firman">firman</a> towards this objective.

Nizami thus started compiling his <a href="Persian%20language">Persian language</a> "Tajul-Ma'asir", the first official history of the Delhi Sultanate. Although the book is written in Persian, it suggests that Nizami had a good command over the <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic language</a> as well. He wrote in an ornate style characteristic of the Arabic poetry and prose.

Since Nizami was more of a poet than a historian, his work features "flights of imagination". For example, he depicts Central Asian plants blossoming in the desert region around <a href="Ajmer">Ajmer</a>. Nevertheless, his book was well-regarded by medieval historians for its detailed descriptions. The 14th century chronicler <a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Ziauddin Barani</a> counts him among the trustworthy historians of the Delhi Sultanate.

The "Tajul-Ma'asir" begins with the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Tarain">Second Battle of Tarain</a> in which the Ghurids defeated the Hindu king <a href="Prithviraja%20III">Prithviraja III</a>. The book doesn't mention the First Battle of Tarain, in which the Ghurids were defeated, as this would have offended Qutb al-Din Aibak. The book then describes how Qutb al-Din (then a Ghurid general) was awarded the governorship of the newly-conquered territory in India. Next, the book provids details about the subsequent military career of Qutb al-Din. The narrative is marred by poetic exaggeration and other irrelevant details, such as the <a href="astrology">effects of planets</a> on living beings.

The book provides comprehensive details about the events between 1192 and 1196. Nizami probably compiled this part of the book between 1206 and 1210. However, his coverage of the post-1196 events is not satisfactory. It is possible that Qutb al-din's untimely death in 1210 dashed Nizami's hopes of receiving a royal reward, and reduced his interest in completing the work. The book goes on to describe the reign of the next ruler <a href="Iltutmish">Iltutmish</a>, but this part appears to have been compiled in haste.

Nizami started writing the book in 1205-1206, and completed it sometime after 1229.

Letters on Sunspots

'Letters on Sunspots' ("Istoria e Dimostrazioni intorno alle Macchie Solari") was a pamphlet written by <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> in 1612 and published in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> by the <a href="Accademia%20dei%20Lincei">Accademia dei Lincei</a> in 1613. In it Galileo outlined his recent observation of dark spots on the face of the sun. His claims were significant in undermining the traditional <a href="Aristotelian%20physics">Aristotelian</a> view that the sun was both unflawed and unmoving. The third letter contains his first clear public statement of support for <a href="Copernicus">Copernicus</a>.

Previous observations of sunspots.
Galileo was not the first person to observe <a href="sunspot">sunspot</a>s. The earliest apparent reference to them appears in the <a href="I%20Ching">I Ching</a> of ancient China, while the earliest recorded observation is also Chinese, dating to 364 BC. Around the same time, the first European mention of sunspots is found, by <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a>. There were reports from Islamic and European astronomers of sunspots in the early ninth century; those occurring in 1129 were recorded by both <a href="Averroes">Averroes</a> and <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a>, whose drawings of the phenomenon are the earliest surviving today. <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> observed a sunspot in 1607 but, like some earlier observers, believed he was watching the transit of <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>. The sunspot activity of December 1610 was the first to be observed using the newly invented <a href="telescope">telescope</a>, by <a href="Thomas%20Harriot">Thomas Harriot</a>, who sketched what he saw but did not publish it. In 1611 <a href="Johannes%20Fabricius">Johannes Fabricius</a> saw them, and published a pamphlet entitled " De Maculis in Sole Observatis", which Galileo was not aware of before he wrote the "Letters on Sunspots."

Critical dialogue with Scheiner.
The <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> <a href="Christoph%20Scheiner">Christoph Scheiner</a> observed sunspots early in 1611. Then, under the pseudonym 'Apelles', he presented his description and conclusions about them in three letters to the <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> banker and scholar <a href="Mark%20Welser">Mark Welser</a>. Welser published them on his own presses, sent copies to astronomers around Europe, and invited them to reply. It was Welser's invitation which prompted Galileo to reply with two letters, arguing that the sunspots were not satellites, as Scheiner ('Apelles') maintained, but were features either on the sun's surface or just above it.

In the meantime, Scheiner sent Welser two further letters on the subject, and after he had read Galileo's first letter, he responded with a sixth of his own. These later letters were different in tone to the first three, as they hinted that Galileo was claiming credit for having discovered the <a href="phases%20of%20Venus">phases of Venus</a>, when in fact proper credit was due to others. They also implied that Galileo had copied Scheiner's <a href="helioscope">helioscope</a> in order to do his research.

Having published Scheiner's first three letters under the title "Tres Epistolae de Maculis Solaribus" ("Three Letters on Solar Spots"), Welser now published his second three, also in 1612, as "De Maculis Solaribus et Stellis circa Iovis Errantibus Accuratior Disquisition" ("A More Accurate Disquisition Concerning Solar Spots and Stars Wandering around Jupiter"). Having read these second three letters, Galileo replied with a third of his own, much sharper and more polemical in tone than his earlier ones. Welser declined to publish Galileo's letters, perhaps because of the sarcastic tone they took towards Apelles, although the reason he gave Galileo was the exorbitant cost of producing all the illustrations Galileo wanted. Galileo's letters were subsequently published by the <a href="Accademia%20dei%20Lincei">Accademia dei Lincei</a> in Rome early the next year, with half the print run of 1,400 also including Scheiner's letters and copies of his illustrations as well.

Censorship by the Inquisition.
Publishing the "Letters on Sunspots" was a major financial and intellectual venture for the Accademia dei Lincei, and it was only the fourth title it had decided to issue. <a href="Federico%20Cesi">Federico Cesi</a> paid for the publication himself, and wanted to strike a careful balance between introducing extraordinary new ideas and avoiding causing offence to people who might find those views problematic. This was consistent with the Accademia's project of acting as a centre for the dissemination of radical new scientific ideas, issued with the agreement of the Church authorities. Cesi tried to persuade Galileo to avoid an aggressive or polemical tone in his letters, to avoid antagonising the Jesuits (Scheiner's identity behind the pseudonym 'Apelles' was already suspected), but having read Scheiner's apparent accusations of bad faith in his later letters, Galileo did not heed his advice. Indeed, the published version of his "Letters on Sunspots" contained a preface by <a href="Angelo%20de%20Filiis">Angelo de Filiis</a> which uncompromisingly asserted Galileo's primacy in discovering sunspots. The text was presented for censorship to the <a href="Roman%20Inquisition">Roman Inquisition</a> in order to obtain permission to print. The censors assigned were Cesare Fidelis, Luigi Ystella, Tommaso Pallavicini and Antonio Bucci.

Ensuring the book was ready to print was a collaborative process involving the censors, Galileo, Cesi and others in working on the text until it was acceptable to the Inquisition, and the censors were well acquainted with the leading figures of the Accademia. Antonio Bucci, for example, was a physician who had previously been involved in reviewing work by <a href="Giambattista%20della%20Porta">Giambattista della Porta</a>, also published by Cesi. In the case of "Letters on Sunspots" his critical support appears to have been helpful in ensuring that publication was not prevented by influential <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominicans</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Sacred Palace</a>. Indeed, in his comments Bucci praised Galileo's work, with which he was already familiar, as he had been invited to take part in the Accademia's discussions about it before the manuscript was presented for censorship.

The censors insisted that Galileo remove from his text any reference to scripture or claims for divine guidance. Thus the pamphlet was to have opened with a quotation from Matthew 11:12 'The kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force.' The censors objected that this could be understood to mean that astronomers wanted to overpower theology. It was therefore amended to 'Already the minds of men assail the heavens, and the more valiant conquer them.' Further on in the text Galileo's claim that 'divine goodness' had led him to advocate the system of Copernicus was struck out, and replaced with 'favourable winds'. Galileo's text referred to the idea that the heavens were immutable as 'erroneous and repugnant to the indubitable truth of Scripture.' Like all other mentions of Scripture, the censors insisted that this too was removed. Galileo wanted to claim divine inspiration for his findings and show how they accorded with Holy Writ; the censors wanted to keep unusual new ideas at a safe distance from core tenets of the faith. With these amendments Galileo was authorised to take his book to print.

Half of the printed edition of 1400 copies of "Letters on Sunspots" contained both the Apelles Letters and Galileo's replies. The other half contained Galileo's work only.The total cost of the book was 258.70 scudi, of which 44 scudi was the cost of the illustrations and tables and 6 scudi was the cost of engraving the frontespiece.

Galileo's First Letter - 4 May 1612.
Galileo describes how he has observed sunspots for eighteen months. His key conclusions arre that sunspots were real and not merely optical illusions; and that they were not static, but moved. Scheiner's view that the spots were satellites prompts Galileo to comment on the <a href="phases%20of%20Venus">phases of Venus</a> and how they supported a heliocentric view. He develops his argument to show that sunspots were not permanent and did not have a regular pattern of movement as they would if they were heavenly bodies - they were nothing like the moons of Jupiter that he had himself discovered and described in "<a href="Siderius%20Nuncius">Siderius Nuncius</a>". 'The sun, turning on its axis, carries them around without necessarily showing us the same spots, or in the same order, or having the same shape.' He noted the parallels between sunspots and clouds over the earth, but did not assert that they were made of the same material. His comment on 'Apelles' (the pseudonym of Scheiner) was:

'It seems to me therefore that Apelles has a free, and not a servile mind; he is well able to grasp true teaching; and now, prompted by the strength of so many new ideas, he is beginning to listen and to assent to true and sound philosophy, especially as regards the arrangement of the universe. But he is not yet able to detach himself completely from the fantasies he absorbed in the past, to which his intellect sometimes returns and lends assent by force of long-established habit.'

Much of Galileo's first letter is devoted to demonstrating weaknesses in Scheiner's arguments - inconsistencies, false analogies, and unlikely conclusions from the observations he had made.




Galileo's Second letter - 14 August 1612.
Galileo's second letter restates the key propositions from his first letter, and is otherwise mostly concerned with geometric proofs that the spots are on the surface of the sun rather than above it. To accompany these proofs Galileo provides 38 detailed illustrations, which allow the reader to see how his observations relate to his calculations. 


Galileo's Third Letter - 1 December 1612.
While Galileo's First and Second Letters had been written in response to Scheiner's "Tres Epistolae", his Third Letter responded to "Accuratior Disquisitio". Galileo was angry to see that once again Scheiner was making claims about the moons of Jupiter, since he regarded them as his own discovery. To demonstrate the falsehood of Scheiner's assertion that the moons of Jupiter were 'wandering stars', unpredictable in their movement, as well as to display his own clear superiority in observation and calculation of celestial movements, Galileo appended complete set of <a href="Ephemerides">Ephemerides</a> for the Jovian moons to his third letter. Galileo shows the critical flaws in Scheiner's geometry, his understanding of the authorities he cites, his reasoning, his observations and indeed his own drawings. 

Introduction.
Galileo says there is no point in speculating about the 'essence' of sunspots, or indeed of other things, but since writing his last letter he has spent time thinking about the uniform motion of the sunspots within a specific band around the Sun's surface. He asks, in passing, 'is there not still a controversy over whether the Earth itself remains immobile, or wanders?', which is an oblique reference to the idea, required by Copernicus' model of the universe, that the earth must rotate on its own axis every day. Lastly, he humorously compares scholars who insist that every detail of Aristotle's writing must be true, whether it corresponds with reality or not, with those artists who draw portraits of people in fruit and vegetables. 'As long as these oddities are offered as jokes, they are nice and pleasing... but if someone, perhaps because he had consumed all his studies in a similar style of painting, then wanted to draw the general conclusion that every other method of imitating was imperfect and blameworthy, surely <a href="Cigoli">Cigoli</a> and other celebrated painters would laugh at him.'

Venus, sunspots and use of authorities.
Galileo takes up once again the question of whether there is any relation between the transit of Venus and sunspots. He criticises 'Apelles' for setting out a long and complex demonstration of the movement of Venus across the face of the Sun, when it was superfluous to his purpose. He criticises him further for giving an estimate of Venus's size as it crosses the Sun which is wrong, and for supporting this estimate with learned authorities from the past who did not have telescopes. Furthermore, Galileo argues, some of the ancient astronomers, including Ptolemy, made more cogent arguments than 'Apelles' suggests.

Galileo notes that 'Apelles' has shifted his view on sunspots since his first letter. At first he insisted they were all spherical, like little moons; now he says they are irregular in shape, forming and dissolving. He previously said that the spots were at various distances from the Sun, wandering between it and Mercury, but he no longer maintains this view. 'Apelles' argues that the hardness and solidity of the Sun means that the fluid spots cannot be on its surface; but citing the authority of the ancients to confirm the Sun's solidity is pointless, since they had no idea of its structure; in any case the evidence of the spots themselves suggests the very opposite to the traditional view of the Sun's hardness. He agrees with 'Apelles' view that the spots are not chasms or pools on the Sun's surface, but nobody had ever argued that they were.

The movement of sunspots.
A large portion of the Third Letter is taken up with disproving Apelles' assertion that he had observed spots passing across the Sun at different speeds - one, on the diameter, taking sixteen days, and another, at a lower latitude, in just fourteen. (If sunspots moved at differential speeds, this tended to suggest they were moons moving independently of the Sun itself). Galileo says that in his own observations he has never seen this differential rate of movement, but that spots always move at a constant speed relative to each other. First Galileo demonstrates that points on two different sunspot trajectories at two different latitudes produce lines which maintain a constant proportion with each other at any point in the rotation. Next he shows that the larger the sphere on which sunspots appear, the less differential there is in their transit times at the same two latitudes. Finally, he shows that for a spot to move along the diameter of the Sun in a period 1⅐ as long as another spot at a latitude 30° higher, the diameter of the sun would need to be more than twice as great as observed. From this he concludes that Apelles is simply wrong, and it is not possible for one spot to traverse the sun in sixteen days, while another takes only fourteen. 

Now Galileo turns to Apelles' illustrations of sunspots, and begins to use them to show how his arguments about sunspot motion are false. He and recalls how Apelles depicts them coming into view, foreshortened, before appearing at their full width. He then demonstrates that for the spots Apelles had observed to change in apparent size as they did, they would need to be on the face of the Sun, because if they were even a short distance above its surface the foreshortening effect would be remarkably different. Galileo challenges Apelles' assertion that he had seen different spots moving at different speeds; particularly that he had seen spots on the Sun's diameter rotate more rapidly than those at higher latitudes. This, he says, is contradicted not only by observation but by Apelles' own statement in another place in his work that spots in the middle of the Sun remain longer than those passing nearer its limb. Finally, Apelles' own illustrations clearly show spots transiting the Sun in around 14½ days, and nothing in his illustrations supports his contention that some take 16, and others 9.

Observations on other planets.
Having disproved Apelles' arguments on sunspots, Galileo addresses a number of his other errors. He briefly responds to Apelles' views on extraterrestrial life; then disposes of the idea that the moon is translucent. He then returns to Apelles' analogy between sunspots and the moons of Jupiter, where he notes that Apelles has subtly moved from arguing that sunspots are like planets, to arguing that planets are like sunspots. 'Carried away by the desire to maintain what he had originally said, and unable to accommodate the spots exactly to the properties once associated with the other stars, [Apelles] has accommodated the stars to the properties that we know belong to the spots.' To dispense once and for all with Apelles' claim that the moons of Jupiter 'appear and disappear', Galileo provides predictions for their positions for the next two months to prove the regularity of their motions.

To demonstrate that natural philosophy must always be led by observation and not try to fit new facts into preconceived frameworks, Galileo comments that the planet Saturn had recently and surprisingly changed its appearance. In his First Letter, he had argued that <a href="%23saturn">Saturn never changes its shape</a>, and never will. Now, he agrees, it has changed shape. He does not try to prove his earlier views right in spite of new facts, but makes cautious predictions about how its appearance may change in future.

Galileo concludes his remarks by criticising those who doggedly adhere to Aristotle's views, and then, drawing together all he has said about sunspots, the moons of Jupiter, and Saturn, ends with the first explicit endorsement of Copernicus in his writings: 

"I think it is not the act of a true philosopher to persist - if I may say so - with such obstinacy in maintaining Peripatetic conclusions that have been found to be manifestly false, believing perhaps that if Aristotle were here today he would do likewise, as if defending what is false, rather than being persuaded by the truth, were the better index of perfect judgement... [and] I say to your Lordship that this star too [i.e. Saturn] and perhaps no less than the emergence of the horned Venus, agrees in a wondrous manner with the harmony of the great Copernican system, to whose universal relations we see such favourable breezes and bright escorts directing us.'

Significance of "Letters on Sunspots".
Ideas.
The common belief until Galileo's time was that the heavens beyond the moon were both perfect and unchanging. Many of the arguments between Scheiner and Galileo were about things observed in the skies that appeared to be changing, and what the nature and significance of that change was. Although the behaviour of sunspots was the main topic of their debate, they also touched on other disputes, such as the <a href="phases%20of%20Venus">phases of Venus</a> and the <a href="moons%20of%20Jupiter">moons of Jupiter</a>.

In a letter to <a href="Federico%20Cesi">Federico Cesi</a>, Galileo said:
'I have finally concluded, and I believe I can demonstrate necessarily, that they [i.e. the sunspots] are contiguous to the surface of the solar body, where they are continually generated and dissolved, just like clouds around the earth, and are carried around by the sun itself, which turns on itself in a lunar month with a revolution similar [in direction] to those other of the planets... which news will be I think the funeral, or rather the extremity and Last Judgement of pseudophilosophy... I wait to hear the spoutings of great things from the <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetics</a> to maintain the immutability of the skies.'

'Flaws' in the sun.
The <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a> of Galileo's time, based on <a href="Physics%20%28Aristotle%29">Aristotle's Physics</a>, held that the sun was 'perfect' and unflawed. Only with the invention of the telescope was it possible for sunspots to be systematically observed. Many who had never seen them found the idea of them morally and philosophically repugnant. Those who could see them, like Scheiner, wanted to find an explanation for them within the Aristotelian system. Galileo's arguments in "Letters on Sunspots" were intended to demonstrate these claims as false; and if they were false, Aristotelian assumptions about the universe could not be true.

Moons of Jupiter.
Galileo had discovered the <a href="moons%20of%20Jupiter">moons of Jupiter</a> in 1609. Scheiner argued that what appeared to be spots on the sun were in fact clusters of small moons, thereby trying to deploy one of Galileo's own discoveries as an argument for the Aristotelian model. In his "Letters on Sunspots" Galileo showed how sunspots were nothing like the moons of Jupiter, and the comparison was false. Scheiner claimed that the sunspots, with their irregular movements, were like the moons of Jupiter whose positions were similarly hard to predict. To counter this argument, Galileo published tables of predictions for the future position of the moons of Jupiter, so that astronomers could easily distinguish between the regular, predictable movements they followed with the ephemeral and irregular sunspots.

Rotation of the sun.
Showing that the sun rotated had two effects. Firstly, it showed that the traditional Aristotelian model of the universe must be wrong, because that model assumed that the sun had only a diurnal (daily) motion around the earth, and not a rotation on its own axis. Secondly, it showed that there was nothing necessarily unusual about rotation of a body in space. In the Aristotelian system, night and day were explained by the sun moving round a static earth. For Copernicus' system to work, there had to be an explanation for why half the earth was not in permanent daylight, and the other in permanent darkness, as it completed its annual motion around the sun. This explanation was that the earth rotated on its own axis once very day. However it was very difficult to prove that the earth was rotating, so to show that the sun rotated made the Copernican model at least more plausible. While the rotation of the sun did not prove Copernicus right, it proved his opponents wrong and made his ideas more likely to be true.

Phases of Venus.
In the "Letters on Sunspots" Galileo responded to claims by Scheiner about the <a href="phases%20of%20Venus">phases of Venus</a>, which were an important question in the astronomy of the time. There were different schools of thought about whether Venus had phases at all - to the naked eye, none were visible. In 1610, using his telescope, Galileo had discovered in that Venus, like the moon, had a full set of phases, but only in "Letters on Sunspots" did he commit this finding to publication. The fact that there was a full phase of Venus, (similar to a full moon) when Venus was in the same direction in the sky as the Sun meant that at a certain point in its orbit, Venus was on the other side of the Sun to the Earth. This indicated that Venus went around the Sun, and not around the earth. This provided important evidence in support of the Copernican model of the universe.

Copernicus.
At least as early as 1597, Galileo had concluded that the Copernican model of the universe was correct but had not publicly advocated this position. In "Siderius Nuncius" Galileo included in his dedication to the Grand Duke of Tuscany the words ' while all the while with one accord they [i.e. the planets] complete all together mighty revolutions every ten years round the centre of the universe, that is, round the Sun.' In the body of the text itself, he stated briefly that in a forthcoming work, 'I will prove that the Earth has motion', which is an indirect allusion to the Copernican system, but that is all. Copernicus is not mentioned by name. It is <a href="%23Copernicus">at the end of the Third Letter</a> that Galileo explicitly declares his belief in the Copernican system.

Language.
While Scheiner wrote his letters in Latin, Galileo's reply was in Italian. Scheiner did not speak Italian, so Welser had to have Galileo's letters translated into Latin so he could read them. This was not the first time Galileo had published in Italian, and Galileo was not the first <a href="Natural%20philosophy">natural philosopher</a> to publish in Italian (for example <a href="Lodovico%20delle%20Colombe">Lodovico delle Colombe</a>'s account of the <a href="Kepler%27s%20Supernova">1604 supernova</a> was in Italian, as was Galileo's reply). However "Letters on Sunspots" was the first book the <a href="Accademia%20dei%20Lincei">Accademia dei Lincei</a> published in Italian. Galileo later said of his preference for Italian over Latin use of Italian:

'I wrote in Italian because I wished everyone to be able to read what I wrote... I see young men... who, although furnished... with a decent set of brains, yet not being able to understand things written in gibberish [i.e. Latin], take it into their heads that in these crabbed folios there must be some grand hocus-pocus of logic and philosophy much too high up for them to think of jumping at. I want them to know, that as nature has given eyes to them, just as well as to philosophers, for the purpose of seeing her works, she has also given them brains for examining and understanding them.'

While Scheiner's lack of Italian hindered his response to Galileo in 1612 while they corresponded through Welser, it also meant that when Galileo published "Il Saggiatore" in 1623, which accused Scheiner of plagiarism, Scheiner was unaware of this until he happened to visit Rome the following year.

Use of diagrams and illustrations.
Most readers of the time did not have a telescope, so could not see sunspots for themselves - they relied on descriptions and illustrations to make clear what they looked like. For this reason the quality and number of illustrations was essential in building public understanding. Scheiner's book of letters had contained illustrations of sunspots which were mostly 2.5 cm in diameter, leaving little space for detail and portraying sunspots as solid, dark entities. Scheiner himself had described them as 'not terribly exact' and 'drawn without precise measurement'. He also indicated that his drawings were not to scale, and the spots in his illustration had been drawn disproportionately large 'so that they would be more conspicuous.' A reader looking at these illustrations might be inclined to agree with Scheiner's view that sunspots were probably planets.

For Galileo to persuade his readers that sunspots were not planets but a much more transient and nebulous phenomenon, he needed illustrations which were larger, more detailed, more nuanced, and more 'natural.' "Letters on Sunspots" carried 38 engravings of sunspots, providing a visual narrative of the sun's appearance from 2 June – 8 July 1612, with some additional illustrations from August. This extensive visual representation, with its large scale and high-quality reproduction, allowed readers to see for themselves how sunspots waxed and waned as the sun rotated. The impact of this series of illustrations was to create a near-photographic sense of reality. This sense undermined the claims made by Scheiner before any argument was mounted to refute them.

Galileo and Prince Cesi selected <a href="Matthaeus%20Greuter">Matthaeus Greuter</a> to create the sunspot illustrations. Originally from <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a> and a convert from Protestantism, Greuter moved to Rome and set up as a printer specialising in work for the Jesuit order. His worked ranged from devotional images of saints through to mathematical diagrams. This relationship may have recommended him as one whose involvement in a publication would perhaps ease its path through censorship; in addition his craftsmanship was outstanding, and he devised a novel etching technique specially in order to make the sunspot illustrations as realistic as possible. Galileo drew sunspots by projecting an image of the sun through his <a href="helioscope">helioscope</a> onto a large piece of white paper, on which he had already used a <a href="Compass%20%28drawing%20tool%29">compass</a> to draw a circle. He then sketched the sunspots in as they appeared projected onto his sheet. To make his illustrations as realistic as possible, Greuter reproduced them at full size, even with the mark of the compass point from Galileo's original. Greuter worked from Galileo's original drawings, with the <a href="Recto%20and%20verso">verso</a> on the copperplate and the image traced through and etched.

The cost of the thirty-eight copperplates was significant, amounting to fully half of the production costs of the edition. Because half the copies of the "Letters" also contained the "Apelles" Letters, Greuter reproduced the illustrations that Alexander Mair had done for Scheiner's book, allowing Galileo's readers to compare two distinct views of the sunspots. He reduced Mair's drawings further in size, and converted nine of the twelve from etchings or engravings into woodcuts, which lacked the subtlety of Mair's originals. Scheiner was evidently impressed by Greuter's work, as he commissioned him to create the illustrations for his own <a href="masterpiece">magnum opus</a> "Rosa Ursina" in 1626. The 1619 work Galileo co-wrote with <a href="Mario%20Guiducci">Mario Guiducci</a>, "Discourse on Comets", mocked Scheiner for the 'badly colours and poorly-drawn images' in his work on Sunspots.

Making predictions to test a hypothesis.
In modern science <a href="falsifiability">falsifiability</a> is generally considered important. In "<a href="De%20revolutionibus%20orbium%20coelestium">De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</a>" Copernicus had published both a theoretical description of the universe and a set of tables and calculating methods for working out the future positions of the planets. In "Letters on Sunspots" Galileo did as Copernicus had done - he elaborated his ideas on the form and substance of sunspots, and accompanied this with tables of predictions for the position of the moons of Jupiter. In part this was to demonstrate that Scheiner was wrong in comparing sunspots with the moons. More generally, Galileo was using his predictions to establish the validity of his ideas - if he could be demonstrably right about the complex movements of many small moons, his readers could take that as a token of his wider credibility. This approach was the opposite of the method of Aristotelian astronomers, who did not build theoretical models based on data, but looked for ways of explaining how the available data could be accommodated within existing theory.

Scholarly reception.
Some astronomers and philosophers, such as Kepler, did not publish views on the ideas in Galileo's "Letters on Sunspots". Most scholars with an interest in the topic divided into those who supported Scheiner's view that sunspots were planets or other bodies above the surface of the sun, or Galileo's that they were on or very near its surface. From the middle of the seventeenth century the debate about whether Scheiner or Galileo was right died down, partly because the number of sunspots was drastically reduced for several decades in the <a href="Maunder%20Minimum">Maunder Minimum</a>, making observation harder. After the <a href="Paris%20Observatory">Paris Observatory</a> was built in 1667, <a href="Giovanni%20Domenico%20Cassini">Jean-Dominique Cassini</a> instituted a programme of systematic observations, but he and his colleagues could find little pattern in the appearance of sunspots after many years of observation. However Cassini's observation did bear out Galileo's argument that sunspots indicated that the sun was rotating, and Cassini did discover the rotation of Mars and Jupiter, which supported Galileo's contention that both the earth and the sun rotated.

Christoph Scheiner.
As Cesi had feared, the hostile tone of the "Letters on Sunspots" towards Scheiner helped turn the Jesuits against Galileo. In 1619, <a href="Mario%20Guiducci">Mario Guiducci</a> published "A Discourse on Comets", which was actually mostly written by Galileo, and which included an attack on Scheiner, although its focus was the work of another Jesuit, <a href="Orazio%20Grassi">Orazio Grassi</a>. In 1623, Galileo wrote "Il Saggiatore" <a href="%23The%20Assayer">("The Assayer")</a>, which accused Scheiner of trying to steal Galileo's ideas.

In 1624, on a visit to Rome, Scheiner discovered that in "The Assayer", Galileo had accused him of plagiarism. Furious, he decided to stay in Rome and devote himself to proving his own expertise in sunspots. His major work on the topic was "Rosa Ursina" (1626–1630). It is widely believed, though there is no direct evidence, that the bitter dispute with Scheiner was a factor in bringing Galileo to trial in 1633, and indeed that Scheiner may have worked behind the scenes to bring the trial about. As a result of pursuing this dispute with Galileo and the years of research it entailed, Scheiner eventually became the world's leading expert on sunspots.

Raffaelo delle Colombe.
Together with <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Lorini">Niccolò Lorini</a> and <a href="Tommaso%20Caccini">Tommaso Caccini</a>, delle Colombe was one of three Florentine <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominicans</a> who opposed Galileo. Along with Raffaelo's brother <a href="Lodovico%20delle%20Colombe">Lodovico delle Colombe</a> they formed what Galileo called the 'Pigeon League'. Caccini and delle Colombe both used the pulpit to preach against Galileo and the ideas of Copernicus, but only delle Colombe is known to have preached, on two separate occasions, against Galileo's ideas about sunspots. The first occasion was 26 February 1613, when his sermon concluded with these words:

'That ingenious Florentine mathematician of ours [i.e. Galileo] laughs at the ancients who made the sun the most clear and clean of even the smallest spot, whence they formed the proverb 'to seek a spot on the sun.' But he, with the instrument called by him a telescope makes visible that it has regular spots, as by observation of days and months he had demonstrated. But this more truly God does, because 'the heavens are not of the world in His sight'. If spots are found in the suns of the just, do you think they will be found in the moons of the unjust?'

The second sermon against sunspots was on 8 December 1615, when the "Letters on Sunspots" had already been referred to the Inquisition for review. The sermon was delivered in <a href="Florence%20cathedral">Florence cathedral</a> on the <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Immaculate%20Conception">Feast of the Immaculate Conception</a>.

'an ingenious academic took for his device a mirror in the face of the sun with the motto 'it shows what is received'. That means he had carved in his spirit I do not know what kind of beloved sun. But what would be better for Mary? Who could fixedly look at the infinite light of the Divine Sun, were it not for this virginal mirror, that in itself conceives it [the light] and renders it to the world? 'Born to us, given to us from an intact virgin?' This is 'Let what is received, be shown'. For one who seeks defects where there are none, is it not to be said to him 'he seeks a spot in the sun?' The sun is without spot, and the mother of the sun is without spot, from where Jesus is born.'

The Roman Inquisition.
On 25 November 1615, the Inquisition decided to investigate the "Letters on Sunspots" because it had been mentioned by <a href="Tommaso%20Caccini">Tommaso Caccini</a> and Gianozzo Attavanti in their complaint about Galileo. Copies of the text were issued to the Inquisition's theological experts on 19 February 1616. On the morning of 23 February they met and agreed two propositions to be censured (that the sun is the centre of the world, and that the earth is not the centre of the world, but moves). Neither proposition is contained in "Letters on Sunspots". Shortly after the decision of the Inquisition, the <a href="Congregation%20of%20the%20Index">Congregation of the Index</a> placed Copernicus' "De Revolutionibus" on the Index. "Letters on Sunspots" was however not banned or required to undergo corrections. This meant that while Catholic scholars could no longer discuss heliocentrism, they could discuss the nature and origin of sunspots freely.

Francesco Sizzi.
In 1611, before the "Letters on Sunspots" appeared, <a href="Francesco%20Sizzi">Francesco Sizzi</a> had published "Dianoia Astronomica", attacking the ideas of Galileo's earlier work, "Siderius Nuncius". In 1612 he went to Paris and devoted himself to the study of sunspots. In 1613 he wrote to Galileo's friend Orazio Morandi, confirming that his circle of colleagues in France agreed with Galileo that sunspots were not freshly generated with each revolution of the sun, but could be observed passing round it several times. Furthermore, Sizzi drew to Galileo's attention something he had not yet noticed - that the inclination of the path travelled by sunspots varied with the seasons. Thus in one part of the year the sunspots appeared to be travelling upwards as well as across the face of the sun; in another part of the year they appeared to be travelling downward. Galileo was to adopt this observation and deploy it in his <a href="Dialogue%20Concerning%20the%20Two%20Chief%20World%20Systems">Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</a> in 1632 to demonstrate that the earth tilted on its axis as it orbited the sun.

Johannes Kepler.
In his work "Phaenomenon singulare" (1609) Kepler had described what he took to be the transit of Mercury, observed on 29 May 1607. However, after Michael Maestlin pointed out Galileo's work to him, he corrected himself in 1617 in his "Ephemerides", recognising long after the event that what he had seen was sunspots. Welser sent Kepler a copy of Scheiner's first three Apelles letters, and Kepler replied before Galileo, arguing, like him, that Sunspots must be on the surface of the sun and not satellites. Kepler reached this conclusion only by studying the evidence Scheiner's had provided, without making any direct observations of his own. Kepler did not however engage with the claims of Galileo in "Letters on Sunspots" or have further involvement in public discussion on the question.

Michael Maestlin.
In his treatise on the comet of 1618, "Astronomischer Discurs von dem Cometen, so in Anno 1618", <a href="Michael%20Maestlin">Michael Maestlin</a> made reference to the work of Fabricius and cited sunspots as evidence of the mutability of the heavens. He made no reference to the work of either Scheiner or Galileo, although he was aware of both. He concluded that sunspots are definitely on or near the sun, and not a phenomenon of the earth's atmosphere; that it is only thanks to the telescope that they can be studied, but that they are not a new phenomenon; and that whether they are on the surface of the sun or move around it is a question to which there is no reliable answer.

Jean Tarde.
The French churchman <a href="Jean%20Tarde">Jean Tarde</a> visited Rome in 1615 and 1615, and he also met Galileo in Florence and discussed sunspots with him, as well as Galileo's other work. He did not agree with Galileo's view that the sunspots were on or near the surface of the sun, and held rather that they were small planets. On his return to France in 1615 he built an observatory at <a href="La%20Roque-Gageac">La Roque-Gageac</a> where he studied sunspots further. In 1620 he published "Borbonia Sidera", dedicated to <a href="Louis%20XIII">Louis XIII</a>, in which he declared the spots to be the 'Bourbon planets'.

Charles Malapert.
The Belgian Jesuit <a href="Charles%20Malapert">Charles Malapert</a> agreed with Tarde that the apparent sunspots were in fact planets. His book, published in 1633, was dedicated to <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Spain">Philip IV of Spain</a> and christened them 'Austrian stars' in honour of the house of <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a>.

Pierre Gassendi.
<a href="Pierre%20Gassendi">Pierre Gassendi</a> made his own observations of sunspots between 1618 and 1638. He agreed with Galileo that the spots were on the surface of the sun, not satellites orbiting it. Like Galileo, he used observation of the spots to estimate the speed of the sun's rotation, which he gave as 25–26 days. Most of his observations were not published however and his notes were not kept systematically. He did however discuss his findings with Descartes.

Rene Descartes.
<a href="Rene%20Descartes">Rene Descartes</a> was interested in sunspots and his correspondence shows that he was actively gathering information about them when he was working on <a href="The%20World%20%28Descartes%29">"Le Monde"</a>. He was aware of Scheiner's "Rosa Ursine" published in 1630, which conceded Galileo's point that sunspots are actually on the face of the sun. Whether he knew of Galileo's ideas primarily through Scheiner or whether he read "Letters on Sunspots" directly is not known, but in his <a href="Principles%20of%20Philosophy">Principles of Philosophy</a> (1644) he refers to ‘spots which appear on the sun's surface also revolve around it in planes inclined to that of the ecliptic’, which appears to indicate at least a knowledge of Galileo's argument. Descartes used sunspots as an illustration of his <a href="Mechanical%20explanations%20of%20gravitation%23Vortex">Vortex Theory</a>.

Giovanni Battista Riccioli.
In his 1651 work "Almagestum Novum", <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Riccioli">Giovanni Battista Riccioli</a> set out 126 arguments against the Copernican model of the universe. In his 43rd argument, Riccioli considered the points Galileo had made in his "Letters on Sunspots", and asserted that a heliocentric (Copernican) explanation of the phenomenon was more speculative, while a geocentric model allowed for a more parsimonious explanation and was thus more satisfactory (ref: <a href="Occam%27s%20Razor">Occam's Razor</a>).

As Riccioli explained it, whether the sun went round the earth or the earth round the sun, three movements were necessary to explain the movement of sunspots. If the earth moves around the sun, the necessary movements were the <a href="orbit">annual motion</a> of the earth, the <a href="diurnal%20motion">diurnal motion</a> of the earth, and the <a href="solar%20rotation">rotation of the sun</a>. However, if the sun moved around the earth, this accounted for the same movement as both the annual and diurnal motions in the Copernican model. In addition, the annual gyration of the sun at its poles, and the rotation of the sun had to be added to completely account for the movement of sunspots. While both models required three movements, the heliocentric model required the earth to make two movements (annual and diurnal) which could not be demonstrated, while the geocentric model was based on three observable celestial movements, and was accordingly preferable.

Athanasius Kircher.
<a href="Athanasius%20Kircher">Athanasius Kircher</a> succeeded Scheiner in the Chair of Mathematics at the <a href="Collegio%20Romano">Collegio Romano</a>. In "<a href="Mundus%20Subterraneus%20%28book%29">Mundus Subterraneus</a>" (1664), he rejected the views of both Scheiner and Galileo, reviving an earlier idea of Kepler's and arguing that sunspots were in fact smoke emanating from fires on the surface of the sun, and that the surface of the sun was therefore indeed perfect as the Aristotelians believed, although apparently disfigured by blemishes. Sunspots, he argued, just like the planets in astrology, had a profound influence on the earth.

Sunspots in Galileo's later writings.
The Assayer.
In "Il Saggiatore" ("<a href="The%20Assayer">The Assayer</a>") (1623) Galileo was mostly concerned with faults in <a href="Orazio%20Grassi">Orazio Grassi</a>'s arguments about comets, but in the introductory section he wrote :
'How many men attacked my Letters on Sunspots, and under what disguises! The material contained therein ought to have opened to the minds eye much room for admirable speculation; instead it met with scorn and derision. Many people disbelieved it or failed to appreciate it. Others, not wanting to agree with my ideas, advanced ridiculous and impossible opinions against me; and some, overwhelmed and convinced by my arguments, attempted to rob me of that glory which was mine, pretending not to have seen my writings and trying to represent themselves as the original discoverers of these impressive marvels.'

Christoph Scheiner took this to be an attack on him. He therefore used "Rosa Ursina" to mount a bitter attack on Galileo, although he also conceded Galileo's main point, that sunspots exist on the Sun's surface or just above it, and thus that the Sun is not flawless.

Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems.
In 1632 Galileo published "Dialogo sopra i due Massimi Sistemi del Mondo" ("<a href="Dialogue%20Concerning%20the%20Two%20Chief%20World%20Systems">Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</a>"), a fictitious four day-long discussion about natural philosophy between the characters Salviati (who argued for Copernican ideas and was effectively a mouthpiece of Galileo), Sagredo, who represented the interested but less well-informed reader, and Simplicio, who argued for Aristotle, and whose arguments were possibly a parody of those made by <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VIII">Pope Urban VIII</a>. The book was reviewed by the Roman Inquisition and in 1633 Galileo was interrogated and found 'vehemently suspect of heresy' because of it. He was forced to renounce his belief in heliocentrism, sentenced to house arrest and banned from publishing anything further. The "Dialogue" was placed on the <a href="Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum">Index</a>.

The "Dialogue" is a broad synthesis of Galileo's thinking about physics, planetary movement, how far we can rely on our senses in making judgements about the world, and how we make intelligent use of evidence. It drew together all his findings and recapitulated arguments made in earlier years on specific topics. For this reason, there is not 'section on sunspots' in the "Dialogue". Rather, they are referred to at various points in arguments about other topics. In the "Dialogue", that sunspots are on the surface of the sun and not planets was taken as established fact. The discussion concerned what inferences could be drawn about the universe from their rotation. Galileo did not argue that the existence of sunspots conclusively proved that the Copernican model was correct and the Aristotelian model wrong; he explained how the rotation of sunspots could be explained in both models, but that the Aristotelian explanation was much more complicated and suppositional.

Day 1 The discussion opens with Salviati arguing that two key Aristotelian arguments are incompatible; either the heavens are perfect and unchanging, or that the evidence of the senses is preferable to argument and reasoning; either we should rely on the evidence of our senses when they tell us changes (such as sunspots) take place, or we should not. Both positions are not tenable.

Day 2: Salviati argues that sunspots prove the rotation of the sun on its axis. Aristotelians had previously held that it was impossible for a heavenly body to have more than one natural motion. Since this is unarguable, Aristotelians must choose between their determination that only one natural movement is possible (in which case the sun is static, as Copernicus argued); or they must explain how a second natural motion occurs if they wish to maintain that the sun makes a daily orbit of the earth. This argument is resumed on Day 3 of the Dialogue.

Patience (After Sebald) (soundtrack)

The soundtrack for "<a href="Patience%20%28After%20Sebald%29">Patience (After Sebald)</a>" (2012), a film by <a href="Grant%20Gee">Grant Gee</a>, was composed and produced by English musician James Leyland Kirby under his <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a> project <a href="The%20Caretaker%20%28musician%29">The Caretaker</a>. The official soundtrack album was issued on 23 January 2012. Unlike other albums of The Caretaker that used old recordings of playful and bright ballroom music, Kirby's score for the film uses a 1927 record of <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>'s piano-and-voice-only composition "<a href="Winterreise">Winterreise</a>" (1828) as its main audio source. It also differs from other works of the project where hissing sounds are used instead of crackles, the loops are shorter in lengths, and the non-musical aspects of each track (the hiss sounds) serve as the foreground of the mix. The soundtrack was favorably received by professional <a href="music%20journalist">music journalist</a>s.
History.
<a href="Grant%20Gee">Grant Gee</a> asked James Kirby to soundtrack his film "<a href="Patience%20%28After%20Sebald%29">Patience (After Sebald)</a>" in 2009. Gee explained in an interview that when he figured out what <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a> he would be using to record footage, he "knew [he] wanted to use James’ music" for the presence of "scratches and degradation and repetition" from old records. Kirby created the soundtrack before he started work on "<a href="An%20Empty%20Bliss%20Beyond%20This%20World">An Empty Bliss Beyond This World</a>" (2011). The official album for the soundtrack of "Patience (After Sebald)" was first issued on vinyl on 23 January 2012 and then in digital stores on 14 February 2012.

On the official album release for "Patience (After Sebald)"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s soundtrack, there are more pianos heard than there are voices. “No one knows what shadowy memories haunt them to this day” is the first track on the album where vocals become a dominate sound. On 15 February 2012, the album "Extra Patience (After Sebald)" was released for free; it is a set of alternate versions of tracks from the soundtrack's main album release as well as music that is not included on the album release but is heard in the actual film. It is where more of the focus is on the vocal aspects of the 78-rpm recording and was compared by James Knapman of "Igloo" magazine to Akira Rabelais' album "<a href="Samadhi%20Sound">Spellewauerynsherde</a>" (2004).

Composition and sound.
The soundtrack is a set of <a href="classical%20music">classical</a> <a href="ambient%20music">ambient</a> piano-based music categorized by Jordan Cronk of "<a href="Coke%20Machine%20Glow">Coke Machine Glow</a>" as "one of the warmest, most tangible examples of modern <a href="drone%20music">drone music</a>." Unlike past works of The Caretaker where the audio snippets used were from bright, playful ballroom records, the main audio source of the soundtrack is a degraded 1927 <a href="78-rpm">78-rpm</a> recording of a rendition of "<a href="Winterreise">Winterreise</a>" (1828), a piece by Austrian composer <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>. The record was bought by Gee and given to Kirby for making the film's music. 

Labeled by critic Andrew Ryce as "one of Kirby's most consistent and stylistically severe" works, the soundtrack only consists of pianos and vocals. As the official press release for the film describes, the soundtrack uses parts of the 78-rpm recording and turns them into a "dust-caked haze of plangent keys, strangely resolved loops and de-pitched vocals which recede from view as eerily as they appear." The samples are repeated, <a href="Audio%20time%20stretching%20and%20pitch%20scaling">stretched</a>, and <a href="Musical%20tuning">detuned</a> to the point where, in the words of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> journalist Heather Phares, "they're nothing but ghostly shadows of themselves" and "literal rings of melancholia." The snippets are altered in ways that results in pianos sounding like organs or synthesizers and, in the words of Knapman, voice parts that turn into "almost operatic <a href="aria">aria</a>s." 

Knapman noted that the loops on the soundtrack are shorter in length than what would usually be heard on other releases of the Caretaker. "Increasingly absorbed in his own world” uses a repeated sample that is the longest in length out of snippets from all the tracks. Jonny Mugwump, a critic for "<a href="Fact%20%28UK%20magazine%29">Fact</a>" magazine, wrote that the music doesn't have "narrative development" and instead uses "world-weary atmospherics and heavy repetition and loops," a structure identical to The Caretaker's album "Persistent Repetition of Phrases" (2008). The score also differs from previous Caretaker works in that hissing sounds are used instead of vinyl crackles and the non-musical elements of the music serve as the main focus (the hiss sounds). As Rory Gibb of "<a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a>" analyzed, the pianos are "half-vanished" by the sounds of static noises and dark mist, while Ben Beaumont-Thomas of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that the pianos "lollop along, drenched in static, while detuned voices burble from the murk." 

Each piece of "Patience (After Sebald)"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s score has audio samples and static sounds with different timbres and moods as well as varied amounts of <a href="Audio%20signal%20processing">processing</a>, and the soundtrack balances between both calm pieces such as "Increasingly Absorbed in His Own World" and sinister cuts such as "No One Knows What Shadowy Memories Haunt Them to This Day" in a <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>-like technique. The most processing takes place on the second half of the original album release, where, in the words of Mark Richardson of "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>", "transformation becomes the prevailing theme." Throughout the soundtrack, the tone of the hiss textures range from calm to harsh to the point where it "separat[es] the listener from the melody" on "Approaching the Outer Limits of Our Solar System," Phares analyzed. Certain samples are used in more than one track but significantly change in terms of how they are processed or change in speed. For instance, “I have become almost invisible, to some extent like a dead man" consists of a piano sample with only very little static sounds in the background. The same snippet is used in “In the deep and dark hours of the night" but with the sample being slowed down and the static being much more present in the mix. 

The soundtrack also varies in the way samples are edited. On "As If One Were Sinking into Sand," the piano loop cuts out and starts over when it perform a melody that starts to "trail up hesitantly," which "expresses Sisyphean frustration" in the words of Phares. She wrote that the track "When the Dog Days Were Drawing to an End" involves a loop where a piano "anticipates a murky vocal," but the loop repeats before the vocal line can finished, thus "leaving listeners craving a resolution that never comes." On "The Homesickness That Was Corroding Her Soul," there is brief silence before the melody beings in each repetition of the loop, which, as Phares described, "seems to punctuate each loop with a pensive sigh." The pitch of the sample also changes randomly, thus giving the track a feel of unease. “No one knows what shadowy memories haunt them to this day” and the album closer "Now the Night is Over and the Dawn Is About to Break" are tracks that stretch out single syllables from male vocal snippets and turns them into what Richardson described as "tense, uneasy drones."

Concepts.
Richardson analyzed Schubert's works as representing "frozen world[s]" and wrote that "Kirby responds in kind, crafting [a film soundtrack] that hints at the season's chill with characteristic complexity and ambiguity." In the music for "Patience (After Sebald)", there is more tension in what Will Ryan of "<a href="Beats%20per%20Minute%20%28website%29">Beats per Minute</a>" described as the "space between the origins of Kirby’s source material and the place – nearly three-quarters of a century later – we’re now hearing it." The record used for making the score is in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a>, which Mugwump suggested was a commentary of the problems of media ownership during a period of <a href="Legal%20aspects%20of%20file%20sharing">illegal downloading</a>. Kirby himself described the soundtrack as "a lot more of a winter album, a lot darker," while Gee explained that the music executes a "gritty, dusty, destroyed universe," which represents "Sebald's images of dust falling, particles and granularity." Cronk theorized that the music regards Kirby's fear of how civilization will work in the future, as it is "grounded in a more contemporary milieu than [other works of the project] even as it continually portends the demise of an unidentified civilization." Richardson wrote that the soundtrack's voice parts "reinforce the feeling of collapsing into something, the howls, that could stand in for pain or ecstasy, suggest that something will never be the same."

Critical reception.
The score for "Patience (After Sebald)" was awarded by magazine "<a href="Chart%20Attack">Chart Attack</a>" as one of the top ten "Great Soundtracks by Independent Artists," where the magazine labeled it as "probably the closest you’ll ever get to hearing what dementia sounds like without actually losing your mind." "Self-titled" magazine called the music "a magical instance of mood manipulation," which was impressive given the type of sounds Kirby worked with that would've otherwise resulted in a "monotonous listen." Describing the music as "conceptually and emotionally satisfying," Phares opined that the score "succeeds as beautifully evocative music to accompany the documentary, as another distinctive entry in Kirby's Caretaker discography and as an inspired blending of different works that makes its own statement."

Cronk highlighted how the music "breathe[d]" the signature style of The Caretaker in a different manner, writing that "the drones he constructs to buttress each piece accentuat[es] the simultaneously lulling and foreboding samples without suffocating the natural ambiance either ingredient naturally imparts." Similarly, Knapman praised Kirby's work for "Patience (After Sebald)" as another example of retaining the Caretaker's style but having different methods doing so. He opined that the short lengths of most of the soundtrack's sample loops led it to be sometimes "actively grating" without watching the film, but the music "peak[ed] more than it dip[ped]" due to the variety of ways that the snippets are manipulated. He also wrote that "Extra Patience (After Sebald)" was better than the official album release of the soundtrack due to its shorter track lengths. Ryan opined that while most of the soundtrack was "truly great," it was also a "little slight" in a few parts where it "sidle[d] around like lost Alzheimer’s patients [...] without really capturing the inherent tragedy there" due to the loops feeling "plodding," "stilted," and not "interesting."

Marcus Nonius Mucianus

Marcus Nonius Mucianus was a <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> <a href="Roman%20senate">senator</a> who was active in the second century. He was <a href="Roman%20consul">suffect consul</a> in the "<a href="nundinium">nundinium</a>" of October-December 138 as the colleague of <a href="Publius%20Cassius%20Secudus">Publius Cassius Secudus</a>.

There is confusion in the secondary literature about the proper form of his name. In one inscription, referring to the <a href="military%20tribune">military tribune</a> of <a href="Legio%20X%20Fretensis">Legio X Fretensis</a>, the name Marcus Nonius Mucianus M.f. Pob. Mucianus Publius Delphius Peregrinus appears. In another, referring to the suffect consul of 138, the name Publius Delphius Peregrinus Alfius Allenius Maxmius Curtius Valerianus Proculus Marcus Nonius Mucianus appears. This problem is discussed by Olli Salomies. While admitting that "there is no compelling reason for the identification", he concedes that "all scholars agree in regarding the men as identical." Salomies then attempts to explain the name in accordance with known rules of Roman naming practice. He proposes that Mucianus was the son of a Marcius Nonius -- "from Verona but related to the Nonii of Brixia" -- and a Delphia P.f.; she was the daughter of a Publius Delphius Peregrinus and of a Delphia who was the sister of a Publius Delphius Peregrius Alfius Alennius Maxmius Curtius Valerianus Proculus. Now, according to Salomies, our subject was originally named Manius Nonius Mucianus Publius Delphius Peregrinus, the items he inherited from his mother added to the end of his name. Between his tenure as legate or assistant to the governor of <a href="Asia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Asia</a> and his consulship, he was adopted by his maternal uncle and accordingly put the adoptive elements -- e.g., Publius Delphius Peregrinus Alfius Alennius, etc. -- at the beginning of his name, and dropping it from the end.

Alföldy states Mucianus has his origins in <a href="Verona">Verona</a>, where two other senators of the same <a href="Roman%20tribes">tribe</a> have been attested. Salomies proposes one of them -- Publius Alfius Alennius Maximus Curtius Valerianus, the son of Curtia C.f. Procilla -- was Mucianus' relative. 

Edward Dabrowa has reconstructed Mucianus' "<a href="cursus%20honorum">cursus honorum</a>" from at least two inscriptions. His first recorded office was as military tribune of Legio X Fretensis, during the reign of Hadrian. This was followed by the traditional order or republican magistracies: <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a>, <a href="aedile">aedile</a>, and <a href="praetor">praetor</a>. Then he was legate of the <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a>ar governor of <a href="Asia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Asia</a>. His career after Mucianus acceded to the consulship is unknown.

Georgiana (1791 ship)

Georgiana was launched in 1791. She served as a merchantman, <a href="packet%20trade">packet</a> ship for the British <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> (EIC), a whaler, a warship of the navy of the United States of America, and a merchant vessel again. She was condemned as leaky and sold in 1818.

Merchantman.
"Georgiana" first appears in "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" in 1791 with W. Waring, master, St Barbe & Co, owner, and trade London—Turkey.

Captain William Waring received a <a href="letter%20of%20marque">letter of marque</a> for "Georgiana" on 29 August 1793. "Lloyd's Register" for 1793 showed her sailing between London and Turkey.

EIC Packet.
Reportedly, At first the EIC simply chartered "Georgiana", but later it purchased her outright. She served as a packet ship between England and India, and also as a tender to the EIC's station at <a href="Saint%20Helena">St Helena</a>.

The EIC on 19 April 1794 appointed Captain John Luard captain of "Georgina".

Missing voyage.
EIC records imply that "Georgiana" made seven voyages for the company. However, records only account for the six listed below. One source has "Georgiana" sailing on 25 January 1795 and returning on 25 March 1797. that conflate the missing first voyage with the subsequent voyage.

EIC voyage #1 (1796–1797).
Captain John Luard sailed from Portsmouth on 23 January 1796, bound for St Helena and Bengal. She reached St Helena on 2 May. By 27 May "Georgiana" was at Simons Bay, and she arrived at <a href="Diamond%20Harbour">Diamond Harbour</a> on 31 July. Homeward bound, she was at St Helena on 5 January 1797, Falmouth on 29 March, and finally Greenhithe on 30 May.

EIC Voyage #2 (1798–1800).
On 27 June 1798 Captain Henry Leigh received a letter of marque. On 21 August he sailed "Georgiana" from Falmouth for St Helena and the Cape of Good Hope. She arrived at St Helena on 26 October and then reached the Cape on 3 December. She was back at St Helena on 14 January 1799, and the Cape on 25 February. She was at <a href="False%20Bay">False Bay</a> on 18 May, the Cape on 14 June, and St Helena on 5 July.

"Georgiana" shared with the garrison of St Helena and the <a href="East%20Indiaman">East Indiaman</a> in the proceeds from the capture of the Danish East Indiaman "Copenhagen" in July 1799.

Between 21 September and 5 October "Georgiana" was cruising. She returned to St Helena on 6 October. She was at <a href="Trindade%20and%20Martim%20Vaz">Trinidade</a> on 27 October, and the Cape on 24 November, before returning to St Helena on 28 December. She then sailed for home, reaching <a href="Shannon%20Estuary">Shannon</a> on 9 April 1800 and <a href="Crookhaven">Crookhaven</a> on 13 May, before arriving at Deptford on 23 May.

EIC voyage #3 (1800–1802).
Captain Leigh sailed from Plymouth on 15 September 1800, bound for Bengal. "Georgiana" reached the Cape on 2 December and arrived at <a href="Kolkatta">Calcutta</a> on 22 February 1801. Homeward bound, she was at <a href="Khejuri%20II%23khijri">Kedgeree</a> on 22 August, reached St Helena on 2 January 1802, and arrived at Deptford on 27 March.

The EIC announced the sale on 30 April 1802 of 1,300 bags of rice that had come from Bengal on "Georgiana" in private trade. The sale of "Georgiana"s rice was to follow the sale that day of 27,000 bags of rice for the EIC's account that the East Indiamen , "Cornwallis", "Medway", and "Union"had brought.

EIC voyage #4 (1803–1807).
<a href="Napoleonic%20Wars%23War%20between%20Britain%20and%20France%2C%201803%E2%80%931814">War with France</a> resumed in May 1803. Captain Leigh received a letter of marque on 3 August 1803. He sailed from Portsmouth on 28 August, bound for St Helena and the Cape. "Georgiana" would then spend some three years at St Helena, serving primarily as a look-out vessel and guard-ship.

"Georgiana" reached St Helena on 23 November and sailed from there on 5 February 1804, returning five days later. On 10 November she sailed from St Helena, returning four days later. On 7 February 1805 she sailed from St Helena, before returning 20 days later. On 12 June she was at <a href="Benguela">Benguella</a>, before returning to St Helena on 29 June. She was again at Benguela on 4 October before returning to St Helena on 1 November. She was again at St Helena on 8 April 1806. False Bay on 11 May, the Cape on 26 May, <a href="Simon%27s%20Town">Simons Bay</a> on 2 June, and St Helena on 24 August. On 17 October "Georgiana" was at the River Plate. On 24 November she was at the Cape, and on 14 January 1807 she returned to St Helena. From there she sailed home, arriving at Blackwall on 15 April.

EIC voyage #5 (1807–1809).
1807/8 Madras and Bengal. Captain Leigh sailed from Portsmouth on 17 November 1807, bound for <a href="Chennai">Madras</a> and Bengal. She reached Calcutta on 13 April 1808. She was at Kedgeree on 19 December, and Madras on 29 December. By 22 February 1809 "Georgiana" was at St Helena; she arrived at Blackwall on 6 May.

EIC voyage #6 (1809–1811).
Captain Leigh sailed from Portsmouth on 4 October 1809, bound for Madras and Bengal. "Georgiana" reached Madras on 16 February 1810, and Calcutta on 16 May. She was at <a href="saagar%20Island">Saugor</a> on 11 September and Madras on 9 October, before returning to Calcutta on 6 November. Homeward bound, she was at Kedgeree on 19 February 1811, the Cape on 2 June, and St Helena on 4 July. On 5 September she arrived at Deptford.

Whaler.
After her return to England, her owners sold "Georgiana" to <a href="Samuel%20Enderby%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Enderby & Co.</a>, London. Enderbys appointed Captain W. Pitt as master, and dispatched "Georgiana" to the South Seas fishery.

USS "Georgiana".
In early 1813 Captain <a href="David%20Porter%20%28naval%20officer%29">David Porter</a> entered the Pacific, via <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, in the thirty-two gun <a href="frigate">frigate</a> <a href="USS%20Essex%20%281799%29">USS "Essex"</a>.

On 29 April 1813 boats from "Essex" captured "Georgiana" off the Galapagos Islands That same day "Essex" captured two more British whalers.

Porter referred to "Georgiana" as a "letter of marque ship, armed with 6 18-pdrs., 4 swivels, and 6 long blunderbusses". He took her crew off, put some 40 to 60 men and some guns aboard her. On 8 May he commissioned her as the USS "Georgiana", under the command of Lieutenant John Downes.

Departing 12 May, "Georgiana" cruised off the Galapagos in search of British whaling ships. While sailing near James Island 28 May, she met "Catherine" and "Rose" and captured them with no resistance. She then chased a third whaler, "Hector" and engaged in a brief, but sharp, combat which brought down "Hector"s main-topmast and most of her standing and running rigging. After capturing "Hector", "Georgiana" placed the crews of all three whalers in "Rose", under parole, and sent her as a <a href="cartel%20%28ship%29">cartel</a> to St Helena. "Georgiana", "Catherine", and "Hector" then on 24 June joined "Essex" at <a href="Tumbes%2C%20Peru">Tumbez, Peru</a>. Also on 28 May, "Essex" captured the whaler "Greenwich"; Porter armed her too as and put Lieutenant Gamble of the US Marines on her as captain.

"Georgiana" departed Tumbez on 30 June and sailed for the Galapagos with "Essex" and the prizes. On 13 July she aided "Greenwich" during a spirited encounter with .

The other two whalers the Americans captured that day were "Charlton" and "New Zealander". Porter fitted out "Seringapatam" to replace "Georgiana". Despite her captures, "Georgiana" had proven to be a "dull sailer". Porter loaded "Georgiana" with a full cargo of sperm oil from several of the captured whalers. He reduced her armament, manned her by a prize crew under Lieutenant James Wilson. She departed the Galapagos for the United States 25 July.

British merchantman again.
On 28 November 1813, recaptured "Georgiana" and sent her into Bermuda. Lloyd's Register for 1814 has the notation "captured" crossed out. It also shows Captain B. Boyes replacing Pitt.

On 13 March 1814 "Georgiana" returned to England. She was carrying almost 3000 barrels of oil as she the combined cargoes of the whalers the Americans had captured, as well as her own.

Her recapture gave rise to a court case over whether "Georgiana" and her cargo were a <a href="prise%20%28law%29">prize</a>, or salvage. The High Court of Admiralty ruled for salvage for the cargo, but a prize for the vessel.

The Register of Shipping for 1815 shows "Georgiana" with R. Boyes, master and owner, and trade London-Bremen. Lloyd's Register (1815) shows B. Boyes as master and J. Boyes as owner.

Fate.
"Georgiana" put into Funchal, Madeira, on 24 February 1818 as she was sailing from Antwerp for the River Plate. She was leaking badly. She was surveyed at Funchal, condemned, and sold there for breaking up.

Portrait of Ferenc Kölcsey (Anton Einsle)

The Portrait of Ferenc Kölcsey () is a painting by <a href="Anton%20Einsle">Anton Einsle</a> in the Art Collection of the <a href="Hungarian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Hungarian Academy of Sciences</a> in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>. It is probably the most famous portrait of <a href="Ferenc%20K%C3%B6lcsey">Ferenc Kölcsey</a>, a leading Hungarian poet, literary critic, orator, and politician in the <a href="Hungarian%20Reform%20Era">Reform Era</a>, who wrote the <a href="Himnusz">Himnusz</a>, the national anthem of <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>.

History.
The idea of the portrait painting emerged for the first time in a letter written by the literary critic <a href="Ferenc%20Toldy">Ferenc Toldy</a> to Kölcsey on 10 December 1834. There is a passing mention that Kölcsey was going to visit his friend, the poet <a href="J%C3%B3zsef%20Bajza">József Bajza</a> in <a href="Pest%2C%20Hungary">Pest</a> on his way towards <a href="Pozsony">Pozsony</a> and there he was going to sit for a portrait. The original idea obviously came from Bajza. Kölcsey was 45 years old at the time when the portrait was created. He had served as deputy of <a href="Szatm%C3%A1r%20County">Szatmár County</a> in the <a href="Diet%20of%20Hungary">Diet of Hungary</a> until 1835. As poet, literary critic and member of the academy he was well-respected. On his way back from Pozsony to Szatmár he stayed in Pest again in the spring of 1835. There he had time to sit for the portrait again. The artist, Anton Einsle had been living in Pest since 1832 as court painter to <a href="Archduke%20Joseph%2C%20Palatine%20of%20Hungary">Archduke Joseph</a>, the <a href="Palatine%20of%20Hungary">Palatine of Hungary</a>.

The portrait was made for the 1836 issue of "<a href="Aurora%20%28literary%20journal%29">Aurora</a>", the prestigious literary almanac of the Reform Era whose editor was József Bajza. György Kilián, the publisher of the magazine wrote that "the portrait, painted by Einsle for this purpose, turned out perfect". <a href="Johann%20Ender">Johann Ender</a> copied it in drawing but in the end the almanac was published without the engraving because "the engraver was not able to recreate on the steel the beauty and the livingness of the original", as the publishers explained it to the public. Bajza wrote a private letter to Kölcsey on 17 January 1836: "The "Aurora" was published but without the image of my dear friend, because the engraver could not make his work done properly as I wished. [...] I respect my friend and the public more than publishing such a mediocre engraving, especially that the original painting by Einsle was executed with a great finesse". The drawing was sent to <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> to <a href="Carl%20August%20Schwerdgeburth">Carl August Schwerdgeburth</a> who made a new engraving that was published subsequently.

The original portrait was purchased by <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20B%C3%A1rtfay">László Bártfay</a>, a lawyer who served as the treasury superintendent of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Bártfay and Kölcsey were friends with common literary interests although Bártfay remained a dilettante. After Bártfay's death in 1858 the painting was inherited by his widow, Jozefin Mauks, although Bártfay gave it to the Academy of Sciences in his will; the institution received the artwork in 1860.

Description.
The friends of the poet thought that the portrait captured his troubled and serious character very well. "At the time my poor, since deceased friend were on his way back to home after the unpleasantries of the diet", wrote Bártfay in a letter in 1839, more than three years after Kölcsey's sudden death. "The colour of learning and weariness, pallor was conspicuous on his face, this is the colour on my painting, showing him ill." In his diary Bártfay disclosed other details: "my painting was his only portrait [in his life], it shows him with a slightly bowed head and neck, that was his natural posture."

The painter did not to hide the fact that Kölcsey's right eye was blind, he was almost totally bald and his head was too large in proportion to his body. Despite of his obvious physical flaws the face still conveys a compelling inner strengh, seriousness and a sense of vocation.

Gelsey Bell

Gelsey Bell is an American singer, songwriter, and actress, best known for her experimental music and her portrayal of <a href="Maria%20Bolkonskaya">Mary</a> in the 2016 <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical "<a href="Natasha%2C%20Pierre%20%26amp%3B%20The%20Great%20Comet%20of%201812">Natasha, Pierre, & the Great Comet of 1812</a>."

Early life and education.
Bell was raised in Northern <a href="California">California</a>. Her father is a philosopher and her mother is a musician. Bell's sister, Biba Bell, is a <a href="choreographer">choreographer</a> and <a href="dancer">dancer</a>, and the sisters created a collaborative performance for the first time in 2016.

Bell attended <a href="Lehigh%20University">Lehigh University</a> and received a BA with a double-major in music and theatre and a minor in philosophy in 2004. She went on to <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, graduating with a PhD in Performance Studies in 2015. Bell has several published performance studies pieces.

Career.
Music.
Bell creates experimental music, and often breaks the fourth wall during live performances. She has written solo albums as well as operas, song cycles, and improvisational pieces.

In 2006, Bell co-founded thingNY, a New York collective of experimental composer-performers. The group has created three concert-length operas: "This Takes Place Close By", "ADDDDDDDDD", and "Time: A Complete Explanation in Three Parts". Bell was particularly praised for the performance piece "This Takes Place Close By", a commentary on <a href="Hurricane%20Sandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>. One critic called her "pure, translucent chorister’s soprano" the "icing on the sonic cake."

In 2012, Bell wrote and premiered "Scaling", a <a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a>, as a part of the Vital Vox Festival. The piece involved many forms of unconventional piano-playing, such as Bell lying on top of the piano and singing while playing. Bell wanted to express a connection between physicality, lyrics, and the way the songs were presented. "Great Weather for Media" called Bell's work "fresh" and "on the edge of what's happening."

Theatre.
Bell was a part of the original cast of <a href="Ghost%20Quartet">Ghost Quartet</a> (performing vocals as well as <a href="metallophone">metallophone</a>, <a href="Celtic%20harp">Celtic harp</a>, <a href="accordion">accordion</a>, and <a href="percussion">percussion</a>), and stayed with the show while it performed at various venues all over the US. Bell was praised by critics for her "astonishing vocal versatility," and was referred to as the "standout vocal performance."

In 2012, Bell first became involved with "<a href="Natasha%2C%20Pierre%20%26amp%3B%20The%20Great%20Comet%20of%201812">Natasha, Pierre, & the Great Comet of 1812</a>", an electro-pop opera based on <a href="War%20and%20Peace">War and Peace</a>. She never auditioned for her role, and was instead asked by composer <a href="Dave%20Malloy">Dave Malloy</a> to come in for its initial workshops, as he had written a part with her in mind. Bell's vocal skills inspired the opera-within-an-opera section of the musical. She refers to the project as her first real acting job, since in most of her other theatrical and musical experiences she was free to portray herself. Bell portrayed <a href="Maria%20Bolkonskaya">Mary Bolkonsky</a> in the musical's initial performances at <a href="Ars%20Nova%20%28theater%29">Ars Nova Theater</a>, and continued with "Great Comet" through its Kazino run and its 2016 opening on <a href="Broadway">Broadway</a>. The performance marked Bell's Broadway debut. Bell was praised for bringing a "compelling light" to Princess Mary, and for her "impressive intense vocal control".

In 2013, Bell was a performer in "Crash", part of a three-series opera which was the last work of composer <a href="Robert%20Ashley">Robert Ashley</a>. "Crash" is unique because it is performed completely a capella, with four voices audible at any given moment. Bell compared Ashley's work to "discovering a garden where different plants blossom on each visit."

In 2015, Bell collaborated with <a href="Erik%20Ruin">Erik Ruin</a> to create the show "Prisoner's Song", an exploration into life in prison. Bell and Ruin utilized music, images, and recorded testimonials from former convicts in the piece. The pair additionally collaborated to create an art installation shown in <a href="Eastern%20State%20Penitentiary">Eastern State Penitentiary</a>.

John Brooke Johnson Brooke

John Brooke Johnson Brooke (born John Brooke Johnson, 1823 – 1 December 1868) was a soldier and Rajah Muda, heir to the Raj, of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sarawak">Kingdom of Sarawak</a> until disinherited in favour of his younger brother, <a href="Charles%20Brooke%2C%20Rajah%20of%20Sarawak">Charles</a>.

Born in <a href="Southstoke">South Stoke</a> near Bath, the son of Francis Charles Johnson, a clergyman who had, in 1822, married Emma Frances Brooke, an elder sister of <a href="James%20Brooke">James Brooke</a>. James took 'Johnny' on a long cruise around the Mediterranean in 1837 in his yacht, <a href="Royalist%20%28schooner%29">Royalist</a>, but John then joined the British army's <a href="88th%20Regiment%20of%20Foot%20%28Connaught%20Rangers%29">88th Foot</a> as an Ensign in 1839, Lieutenant in 1842, and Captain in 1848.

Brooke, his preferred name by then, left the army in 1848, adopted the surname of Brooke (confusingly, as he already had this as a given name), and went to join his uncle in <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> as Rajah Mudah, taking effective charge of the country when James returned to England. He spent some time in <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Labuan">Labuan</a> at first as James was establishing himself as its first Governor, but was subsequently based in <a href="Kuching">Kuching</a>. He has been largely ignored in the standard historical accounts of Sarawak, but substantial records survive which show how active he was, and his engagement with pirates in the <a href="Battle%20off%20Mukah">Rainbow</a> late in 1862 has attracted interest.

Brooke was married, and widowed, twice. He married Anne Grant, a granddaughter of <a href="Thomas%20Bruce%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Elgin">Lord Elgin</a>, at <a href="Kilgraston%20School">Kilgrastron</a> in Scotland in 1856. They went to live in Kuching where they had two sons, Basil (1857–1860), and John Charles Evelyn Hope (1858–1934), but Anne died shortly after Hope's birth. Brooke's second marriage was to Juliana Caroline Welstead: they had met in England but married in Singapore in 1861; Julia died giving birth to a daughter, Matilda Agnes (1862–1943).

He died in <a href="Hounslow">Hounslow</a> in 1868 after a long illness, but was buried in his father's churchyard at his childhood home of <a href="White%20Lackington">White Lackington</a>.

2006 Euro Beach Soccer League – Last chance bracket

The 2006 Euro Beach Soccer League – Last chance bracket, simply known as the "Last chance bracket" was an additional round of the <a href="2006%20Euro%20Beach%20Soccer%20League">2006 Euro Beach Soccer League</a> (EBSL) that was specially organised to determine the fifth and final European nation that would qualify for the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20Beach%20Soccer%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup</a>.

The event was organised by <a href="Beach%20Soccer%20Worldwide">Beach Soccer Worldwide</a> (BSWW), in parallel with the staging of the the <a href="2006%20Euro%20Beach%20Soccer%20League%23Superfinal">2006 EBSL Superfinal</a>, taking place during the same dates (24–27 August) and in the same location of <a href="Marsielle">Marsielle</a>, <a href="France">France</a>.

Five berths were allocated to European teams in the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20Beach%20Soccer%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup</a>, four of which were filled when <a href="Portugal%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Portugal</a>, <a href="Spain%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Spain</a>, <a href="Italy%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Italy</a> and <a href="Poland%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Poland</a> reached the <a href="2006%20Euro%20Beach%20Soccer%20League%23Semi-finals">semi-finals of the Superfinal</a>. This meant there was still one final berth at the World Cup to be filled. In order to decide which nation would get this fifth and final spot at the World Cup, BSWW decided the prospective nations would compete in a knockout tournament called the "Last chance bracket", with the winner claiming the final World Cup ticket. 

<a href="France%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">France</a> won the event by beating <a href="Switzerland%20national%20beach%20soccer%20team">Switzerland</a> in the final and claimed the last remaining World Cup berth.

Teams.
This round of the 2006 EBSL was a distinctly separate and unique event from the regular structure of the league, but nevertheless related to the league since it involved inviting back all the teams previously knocked out of World Cup qualifying contention during this year's EBSL to compete in the event for a second chance at qualification, as well as four wild-card entries, as listed below.
These nations finished in 5th through 9th in Division B, failing to qualify for Division A

Beginning as an amateur shell enthusiast, she went on to work as a conchology curator for the Dominion Museum in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>.

She donated scientific and personal collections to the <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa">Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa</a>.

History.
In 1880, Metsayer was born in England. Her family migrated to Australia when she was 2, and to Wellington when she was 12. Her father, Richart Mestayer, was "an amateur naturalist with interests in things microscopic, like foraminifera. Undoubtedly his enthusiasm for the natural world rubbed off on Marjorie".

From her teens, Metsayer began collecting and analysing shells. At first her displays and publications were in support of other conchologists, including <a href="Tom%20Iredale">Tom Iredale</a>. Later, independently, she collected and analysed sands and dredgings from New Zealand shorelines including <a href="Titahi%20Bay">Titahi Bay</a> and deep-water dredgings provided by <a href="John%20Bollons">Captain John Peter Bollins</a>.

Metsayer was the conchologist at the <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa">Dominion Museum</a> between 1907 and 1932. She also donated specimens to the <a href="Auckland%20War%20Memorial%20Museum">Auckland Museum</a>, where her frequent correspondent, <a href="Arthur%20William%20Baden%20Powell">Baden Powell</a>, was the chief conchologist. Her works included 18 publications between 1907 and 1930. She focused on gastropods and chitons. Much of her work turned out to be <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a> or replication, due to issues in obtaining current literature. Much of her work is still considered to be valid.

As a Wellington resident, Metsayer was active with the St. John Ambulance Association and the Anglican church She was also the subject of a popular culture profile in the newspaper "NZ Truth":

Kimberly Zieselman

Kimberly Zieselman is an <a href="Lawyer">attorney</a>, <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> <a href="Advocacy">advocate</a>, and <a href="intersex">intersex</a> woman, with <a href="androgen%20insensitivity%20syndrome">androgen insensitivity syndrome</a>. She currently serves as executive director of <a href="Interact%20Advocates%20for%20Intersex%20Youth">interACT</a> (formerly Advocates for Informed Choice). 

Early life and medical treatment.
Zieselman has described how, at age 15 and because she hadn't menstruated, she was referred to a reproductive oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, a teaching hospital, and told that her ovaries and uterus needed to be removed to eliminate a risk of cancer. She had surgery at age 16, requiring a subsequent dependence on <a href="hormone%20replacement%20therapy">hormone replacement therapy</a>. Neither Zieselman nor her parents were told the truth about her diagnosis, that she had <a href="androgen%20insensitivity%20syndrome">androgen insensitivity syndrome</a>, XY sex chromosomes, and internal testes.

Zieselman discovered her medical records at age 41, including a statement that she and her parents had consented after full disclosure of a diagnosis. Discovery was disorientating, challenging her identity and that of her husband, but Zieselman has also described how "I felt free when I found out".

Career.
Zieselman trained as a lawyer, and worked in the field of family law and <a href="assisted%20reproductive%20technology">assisted reproductive technology</a>.

Intersex advocacy.
In 2009, Zieselman discovered the peer support group AIS-DSD Support Group, and she later became a director of that organization. Zieselman is now executive director of <a href="Interact%20Advocates%20for%20Intersex%20Youth">interACT</a>, an organization that promotes the rights of intersex youth, including through litigation, development of youth leadership, and media work.

The main goal of interACT is to end non-medically necessary surgeries on intersex children. Zieselman describes how intersex children just have a different type of body, and <a href="intersex%20medical%20interventions">genital surgeries</a> are not medical or social emergencies. Zieselman describes how shame and secrecy, and medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex infants causes devastating physical and psychological harm, but they take place for sociological reasons. She calls for a moratorium on surgeries until children are old enough to choose for themselves, with parents given a "full spectrum of choices".

Zieselman is quoted by the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> Human Rights Office in New York stating:
Zieselman has described how the <a href="Intersex%20and%20LGBT">LGBT</a> community has helped open doors, but how intersex rights are broader: "at its core this is a children’s rights issue. It is also about health and reproductive rights, because these operations can lead to infertility". She has described the MTV series <a href="Faking%20It%20%282014%20TV%20series%29">Faking It</a> as ground-breaking, and the public disclosure by model <a href="Hanne%20Gaby%20Odiele">Hanne Gaby Odiele</a> of her intersex trait as a tipping point for the intersex movement.

No. 2 Training Group RAAF

No. 2 (Training) Group RAAF was a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">group</a>. It was formed in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> in August 1941 as part of a reorganisation of the air force, and was disbanded after the war in March 1946.

History.
Prior to World War II, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. After war broke out in September 1939, the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure, commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units. Its initial move in this direction was to create Nos. 1 and 2 Groups to control units in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, respectively. Then, between March 1940 and May 1941, the RAAF divided Australia and New Guinea into four <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based command-and-control zones</a>: <a href="Central%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Central Area</a>, <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area</a>, <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area</a>, and <a href="Northern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Area</a>. Each was led by an <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) responsible for the administration and operations of all air bases and units within his boundary. No. 2 Group, which had been established on 20 November 1939, was re-formed as Central Area Command on 7 March 1940. Headquartered in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Central Area controlled all Air Force units in New South Wales except those in the southern <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a> and the north of the state.

By August 1941, the RAAF's expanding instructional program necessitated the establishment of overarching training organisations on a semi-functional, semi-geographical basis. Accordingly, on 2 August 1941, No. 2 (Training) Group was formed in Sydney to assume responsibility for training units then under Central Area Command, which was disbanded. Three other training groups were envisaged, but in the event only <a href="No.%201%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">No. 1</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> was formed. No. 2 (Training) Group moved headquarters from Sydney to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Wagga">Wagga</a>, New South Wales, on 22 May 1942. As of early 1943, both active training groups reported directly to RAAF Headquarters. Group Captain <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a> commanded No. 2 (Training) Group from July to November 1943. Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a> took command in April 1945, and held the post for the remainder of the Pacific War.

Following the end of the war, No. 2 (Training) Group was disbanded at Wagga on 26 March 1946.

Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time

"The 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time" is a feature published by the American magazine "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" in August 2015. The list presented was compiled based on the magazine's <a href="music%20criticism">music critics</a>. It predominantly features American and English songwriters of the rock era.

Reception.
The list received mixed response from fellow publications. Writing for "<a href="Flavorwire">Flavorwire</a>", Judy Berman criticized the selection of the songwriters, saying "Predictably, it's over 70% white and features only nine solo female songwriters (five other women are included as part of mixed-gender writing teams). Classic rock is overrepresented; every other genre and subgenre of popular music is underrepresented." Geeta Dayal from "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" accused "corporate sponsorship" in determining the list's content. Tom Moon from <a href="NPR">NPR</a> wrote that "This list represents another trip through the hagiographic, hermetically sealed <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">rock hall of fame</a>, with the same stars you've been reading about in Rolling Stone since the dinosaur age." "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" editor Martin Chilton responded with a list of 100 best songwriters missed out by "Rolling Stone", including <a href="Cole%20Porter">Cole Porter</a>, <a href="Townes%20Van%20Zandt">Townes Van Zandt</a>, <a href="Ewan%20MacColl">Ewan MacColl</a>, <a href="Kate%20Bush">Kate Bush</a>, and <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>.

Jacqueline Cutler from "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" agreed with the magazine for ranking <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> as the top songwriter. Baby A. Gil from "<a href="The%20Philippine%20Star">The Philippine Star</a>" reacted positively to the list, saying that "it is the best list of its type that I have come across and I like the fact that it arouses interest in sounds one may not have heard before or in a long time."

Pamela Young

Pamela Young was the first <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> woman to live and work in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. In 1969–70, she worked at <a href="Cape%20Bird">Cape Bird</a> as field assistant to her husband Euan, a biologist, and was among the first six women to fly to the South Pole. She wrote a book about her trip ("Penguin summer or a rare bird in Antarctica"). The <a href="Young%20Peaks">Young Peaks</a> in Antarctica are named after her.

Early life and education.
Pamela Young studied at the University of Otago and graduated BA in 1958. In 1959, she married Euan Young, a zoology lecturer at the University of Canterbury. Euan Young visited Antarctica for the first time during the 1959/60 season to work at <a href="Cape%20Royds">Cape Royds</a>, while Pamela spent the summer employed in a jam factory. 

Euan and Pamela Young lived in England for several years before returning to Christchurch and Dr Young, again working for the University of Canterbury, then went on four more trips to Antarctica. 

Antarctica.
Only a small number of New Zealanders had been to Antarctica at this time. “The number of OAEs (Old Antarctic Explorers) remained small, and invested with mystique. New Zealand’s Antarctic programme was then the prerogative of small <a href="Department%20of%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20%28New%20Zealand%29">DSIR</a> parties, and the universities were only just beginning to realise the possibilities for research. The continent remained unvisited except by a small, privileged handful of people." 

As late as 1965, Admiral James Reedy had uttered his famous definition of Antarctica as "'the womanless white continent of peace"', but attitudes were slowly changing. Euan told Pamela that “the Americans are keen to take girls down this year.… so it would be fair enough for us to send one New Zealander.”    

Pamela Young joined her husband as his field assistant at Cape Bird on his sixth trip. She was not the first New Zealand woman in Antarctica (that was zoologist Marie Darby, who visited Antarctica in January 1968), but she was the first to live and work there as a member of a research team, although not trained as a scientist. She was described as the "First Lady for Scott Base" when her selection was announced in June 1969.

The presence of even one woman involved extra planning for equipment, accommodation and bathroom facilities. Lane Walker Rudkin, a local clothing manufacturer, gave her woollen jerseys and ski pants, as well as “two pairs of special long-johns in the finest of creamy white wool”, so she didn't have to wear men’s ones. 

in November 1969, Pamela and Euan Young flew in a Starlifter from Christchurch to <a href="Williams%20Field">Williams Field</a> and took a Snotrack to <a href="Scott%20Base">Scott Base</a>. They spent ten weeks living and working with a small team at Cape Bird. On 17 January 1960, they made the final penguin count and headed back to Scott Base and home.

Personal life.
In 1971,when "Penguin summer" was published, Pamela and Euan Young and their two children were living in Western Samoa where Euan was carrying out research into the rhinoceros beetle, an introduced pest of the coconut palm. In 1972, the family moved back to New Zealand when Euan Young was appointed to the Chair of Zoology at the University of Auckland.

Milton Packer

Milton Packer (b. ca 1951) is an American cardiologist who is known for his clinical research concerning <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>. 

Early life and education.
Milton Packer was born in the US to holocaust survivors who were saved from the <a href="Vilna%20ghetto">Vilna ghetto</a> by <a href="Karl%20Plagge">Karl Plagge</a>. He grew up in Philadelphia, where his father worked as a tailor. He was politically active in the 1960s.

He earned his undergraduate degree at Pennsylvania State University in 1971 and his medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1973 when he was 22 years old. He did his residency at <a href="Albert%20Einstein%20College%20of%20Medicine">Albert Einstein College of Medicine</a> in New York City where <a href="Edmund%20Sonnenblick">Edmund Sonnenblick</a> was working, and a fellowship in cardiology at <a href="Mount%20Sinai%20School%20of%20Medicine">Mount Sinai School of Medicine</a> in New York, where <a href="Richard%20Gorlin">Richard Gorlin</a> was conducting research.

He entered the field of cardiology in an era of revolution in that field, with the introduction of <a href="interventional%20cardiology">interventional cardiology</a> and <a href="echocardiography">echocardiography</a> doctors could measure what was happening with their patients' hearts in a way that had never been possible; much of the innovation was happening in New York City.

Academic career.
In 1979 he was made an assistant professor at Mount Sinai, was promoted to associate professor in 1983, and was made a professor in 1988. In 1992 he moved to <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> and was made the Dickinson Richards Professor of Medicine. Columbia has recruited him with an invitation to build a clinical and research program in heart failure and he in turn recruited faculty who had a strong interest in both; members of the group could come up with a hypothesis about heart failure while treating a patient and that doctor or another member would begin exploring it in research the same day. 

In 2004 he moved to <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20Southwestern%20Medical%20Center">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</a> as a <a href="trailing%20spouse">trailing spouse</a>. He was offered a named professorship and the opportunity to set up a center within the college focused on teaching <a href="clinical%20research">clinical research</a> and supporting career development for doctors who wanted to pursue a career in clinical research. The center also brought <a href="Biostatistics">biostaticians</a>, who had been in the public health department, together with physicians from many branches of medicine, with the goal of spreading the appreciation for rigorous statistical design of clinical research. and making statistical expertise more widely available in the college. Packer also won UT Soutwest an NIH <a href="Clinical%20and%20Translational%20Science%20Award">Clinical and Translational Science Award</a> award in 2007 to support these efforts.

In 2015 he joined the <a href="Baylor%20University%20Medical%20Center%20at%20Dallas">Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas</a> with an appointment of Distinguished Scholar.

Research.
Along with practicing cardiology, he spent the first part of his career doing small <a href="clinical%20research">clinical research</a> studies trying to better understand the pathology of heart failure.

In 1992 he published a paper on a neurohormonal hypothesis to explain heart failure that synthesized ideas that were percolating at the time; the paper made him known as the father of that idea.

In 1986 he joined the Cardiac and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee at the FDA, an event that he said was life-changing. 
"The pivotal event for me was my appointment as a member of the cardiorenal advisory committee for the Food and Drug Administration. The Food and Drug Administration is the country's most valuable resource for clinical data, clinical research design, and clinical research analysis. The people who are there receive voluminous amounts of data about drugs in development and drugs already on the market and are challenged with with how to find the "truth" in the data and how to translate that truth into decisions about public health. This is an unbelievably hard job and a terribly important responsibility. If the FDA makes a mistake, there is a potential for an enormous amount of suffering; if they do the right thing, there is a real opportunity for an enormous number of lives to be saved and the quality of lives to be improved. They have, within their community, developed clinical trial methodology to an unbelievably high standard, the highest standard in the world."

After this he started getting involved running large multi-center <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a>s for heart failure drugs, several of which were landmark studies in the care of heart failure. 

He was principal investigator on the REFLECT trial for <a href="flosequinan">flosequinan</a> which ran from 1987-1989 and the following PROFILE trial from 1991-1994. He was PI on a study of <a href="amlodipine">amlodipine</a> that ran from 1987-1989 and the following PRAISE trial from 1992-1995 and PRAISE 2 from 1996-1999; the PROMISE trial for <a href="milrinone">milrinone</a> 1988-1990; the ATLAS trial for <a href="lisinopril">lisinopril</a> from 1993-1997; the PRECISE trial for <a href="carvedilol">carvedilol</a> from 1993-1995 and the following COPERNICUS trial from 1997-2002; the ENABLE trial (1999-2001) and REACH-1 trial (1997-2003) for <a href="bosentan">bosentan</a>; the OVERTURE trial (1999-2002) for <a href="omapatrilat">omapatrilat</a>; REVIVE I and II (2001-2006) for <a href="levosimendan">levosimendan</a>; and the TRUE-AHF trial of <a href="ularitide">ularitide</a> that started in 2013. He also chaired the steering committee for the RADIANCE trial from 1989-1992 which studied the use of <a href="digoxin">digoxin</a> in people who were also treated with <a href="ACE%20inhibitors">ACE inhibitors</a> and chaired the steering committee for the RENEWAL trial (1999-2002) for <a href="etanercept">etanercept</a>. He was also the co-PI of the PARADIGM-HF trial that led to the approval of <a href="valsartan/sacubitril">valsartan/sacubitril</a>.

The PROFILE trial had negative results; it was terminated early in 1993 due to increased mortality in the drug arm of the trial. Packer was the lead author of the conference abstract in which topline results were presented. The abstract promised that data and analysis would be forthcoming in a future paper; as of 2001 no such paper had been published. Similarly, the REACH-1 trial had negative results and was terminated early, and the preliminary results were presented at a conference by Packer, with no full publication following as of 2001, leaving the field without insight into why the drug caused harm at the dosage given in that trial. Results of both trials were were published in 2017, with an explanation about the delay.

The success of the PARADIGM-HF trial was a great satisfaction for him, as it validated the neurohormonal hypothesis; an earlier effort with <a href="omapatrilat">omapatrilat</a> had failed due to side effects caused by the drug candidate.

He was a founding member and former President of Heart Failure Society of America. His research on the treatment of heart failure led to him being awarded the Lewis Katz lifetime achievement award in cardiovascular research.
