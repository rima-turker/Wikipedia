Sir Hugh Munro, 8th Baronet

Sir Hugh Munro, 8th Baronet (of Foulis), born 25 October 1763, was a Scottish noble and also the chief of the <a href="Clan%20Munro">Clan Munro</a>, a <a href="Scottish%20clan">Scottish clan</a> of the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a>. By tradition he was also the twenty-sixth Baron of Foulis. Before he died a dispute took place over the legitimacy of his daughter, resulting in a lawsuit.

Early life.
Sir Hugh Munro was the son of <a href="Sir%20Harry%20Munro%2C%207th%20Baronet">Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet</a> and his wife Ann Rose, daughter of Hugh Rose, XIV of Kilravock, chief of the <a href="Clan%20Rose">Clan Rose</a>. Shortly after the death of his father in 1781 Sir Hugh moved to <a href="London">London</a> where he resided for many years. In 1794 whilst in London Sir Hugh entered into what Mackenzie describes as an irregular union with Jane, daughter of Alexander Law, a native of <a href="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a>. The couple married on 24 September 1801 in accordance with Scots Law. Shortly after they married they took up their residence at <a href="Foulis%20Castle">Foulis Castle</a>, <a href="Ross-shire">Ross-shire</a>.

Death of wife.
On 3 August 1803, Sir Hugh’s wife Jane drowned in the <a href="Cromarty%20Firth">Bay of Cromarty</a> near Foulis Castle, having gone to there bathe. Three other people were also drowned in the same incident having apparently gone out of their depth in the water and although their cries brought the assistance of a boat, it apparently arrived after they had drowned. 

Lawsuit and legitimacy of daughter.
Sir Hugh and his wife Jane had an only daughter Mary Seymour Munro who was born 14 November 1796 in London. A lawsuit subsequently ensued as to the legitimacy of Mary and her right to succeed to the Foulis estates. Ultimately Mary succeeded and continued for several years. Doubts were raised of Mary's legitimacy with the absence of legitimate heirs from Hugh meaning that <a href="Munro%20of%20Culrain">George Munro of Culrain</a> would succeed, given that the male line of <a href="Munro%20of%20Culcairn">Munro of Culcairn</a> was (allegedly) extinct. However, even though the marriage of Mary's parents in England after her birth legitimized her, the estate of Foulis and Baronetcy of Foulis would still be separated with the latter still going to Munro of Culrain. According to Mackenzie the separation of the title and the estates would have been a serious matter to the Munros of Culrain, who as would-be chiefs of the clan would be almost landless and as such it can be readily believed that interested persons were spreading reports that Mary was illegitimate and that her parent's marriage in <a href="England">England</a> several years after her birth would not have the same effect of legitimization in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>.

It became necessary for Mary, with the assistance of her father Hugh, to establish her legitimacy. As a result on 27 May 1831 a summons and declaratory of legitimacy was issued by the <a href="Court%20of%20Session">Court of Session</a> against the Munros of Culrain, in accordance with Sir Harry Munro's deed of entail the terms of which said that the descendants of Hugh should succeed first, if that line failed then the Munros of Culcairn, followed by the Munros of Culrain.

Duncan Munro of Culcairn died in 1820, and according to Mackenzie his son died the following year thus ending their direct male line. On 12 May 1835 <a href="Lord%20Ordinary">Lord Ordinary</a> ordered the Munro of Culrain case to be ordered to the First Division of the Court of Session. On 12 January 1836 the First Division found the case in favour of Mary being legitimate as did the Court on 15 November 1837. This judgment was appealed to the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, but in 1840 they reversed it on the grounds that Sir Hugh the father, never lost his Scottish domicile and so his marriage in England to the mother of Mary after her birth, as if celebrated in Scotland where the marriage legalizes the birth of all children previously born out of wedlock.

Death.
Sir Hugh Munro, 8th Baronet died in 1848 and his daughter Mary intended to take up her residence in Foulis Castle, but before she was able to do so she died unmarried on 12 January 1849 at her temporary residence in Perry Hill, <a href="Sydenham">Sydenham</a>, county of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. She was interred at <a href="West%20Norwood">Norwood</a> having only survived her father by 8 months.

Sir Hugh had also had a natural (illegitimate) son called George who was half-brother to Mary. Mary bequeathed to George the property of <a href="Milton%2C%20Easter%20Ross">Milntown</a>, and upon his death he left it in trust to the Cooperation of Perth. According Mackenzie, this George Munro removed all of his grandfather Sir Harry's family papers and valuable manuscripts where they were destroyed at his sister's residence in Perry Hill, Sydenham. However, the "Calander Writs of Munro of Foulis" which are a series of legal documents concerning the Munro of Foulis family from the year 1299 to 1823 were "discovered" in the 1930's, and were published in books in 1938, and 1940. The Foulis Writs have also shown Mackenzie not to be entirely accurate. According to Mackenzie George was interred in his sister's grave.

Upon Mary Seymour Munro's death the estate and Baronetcy of Foulis passed to <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Munro%2C%209th%20Baronet">Sir Charles Munro, 7th of Culrain and 9th Baronet of Foulis</a>.

Career.
A few years after graduating from <a href="Smith%20College">Smith College</a> (Bachelor's degree in 1920 and Master's in 1922), she began working for "Springfield Sunday Union" and "<a href="The%20Republican%20%28Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts%29">The Springfield Republican</a>", both newspapers based in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield, Massachusetts</a>. She became deeply invested in the <a href="Sacco%20and%20Vanzetti">Sacco-Vanzetti case</a> and eventually complied a series of articles in a pamphlet called The Blue Menace. 

She taught at <a href="Barnard%20College">Barnard College</a> (1956), <a href="New%20School%20for%20Social%20Research">New School for Social Research</a> (1946), <a href="Design%20Laboratory">Design Laboratory</a> (1939) and <a href="Sarah%20Lawrence%20College">Sarah Lawrence College</a> (art history, 1942-1944).

Writing primarily on <a href="Social%20realism">Social Realist</a> painting and photography, McCausland’s reaction to the art world’s turn to abstraction in the 1950s was grim, stating that she felt it “to be the artist’s flight from reality and from responsibility.” Her feelings softened somewhat in later years, and she wrote that in her holistic commitment to the social aspects of art, she felt she had neglected her own emotional and poetic sides. 
Along with many works on individual artists, including a monograph of photographer, <a href="Berenice%20Abbott">Bernice Abbott</a>, her partner, McCausland authored "Work for Artists" (1947), which outlined the living conditions and economic status of the American artist.

Gallery, 1944). 
In 1943, she received a <a href="Guggenheim%20Fellowship">Guggenheim Fellowship for Humanities, US & Canada</a>, for her study of "the status of the artist in America from colonial times to the present, with especial attention to the relation between art and patronage".
In 1944 she was appointed on the Advisory Committee of the Department of Photography of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>.
In 1950 she worked as a special consultant at the <a href="Corcoran%20Gallery">Corcoran Gallery</a> for an American Processional exhibition and was editor of the accompanying book.

Les Djinns (poem)

Les Djinns is one of the most famous poems of French author <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, published in 1829 in "<a href="Les%20Orientales">Les Orientales</a>" collection.

Form and purpose.
"Les Djinns" is distinguished by its very original form, in "crescendo" and "decrescendo": the strophes have a different number of syllables, respectively 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and finally 2. This form resonates with the poem, which is the account of the crash caused by the passage of a swarm of <a href="djinn">djinn</a>s around the narrator's house.

The epic and mystical force of this poem makes it one of the bravest pieces of the collection. 

Poem in verse.
Les Djinns
<poem>Murs, ville,
Et port,
Asile
De mort,
Mer grise
Où brise
La brise,
Tout dort.

Dans la plaine
Naît un bruit.
C'est l'haleine
De la nuit.
Elle brame
Comme une âme
Qu'une flamme
Toujours suit!

La voix plus haute
Semble un grelot.
D'un nain qui saute
C'est le galop.
Il fuit, s'élance,
Puis en cadence
Sur un pied danse
Au bout d'un flot.

La rumeur approche.
L'écho la redit.
C'est comme la cloche
D'un couvent maudit ;
Comme un bruit de foule,
Qui tonne et qui roule,
Et tantôt s'écroule,
Et tantôt grandit,

Dieu ! la voix sépulcrale
Des Djinns !... Quel bruit ils font !
Fuyons sous la spirale
De l'escalier profond.
Déjà s'éteint ma lampe,
Et l'ombre de la rampe,
Qui le long du mur rampe,
Monte jusqu'au plafond.

C'est l'essaim des Djinns qui passe,
Et tourbillonne en sifflant!
Les ifs, que leur vol fracasse,
Craquent comme un pin brûlant.
Leur troupeau, lourd et rapide,
Volant dans l'espace vide,
Semble un nuage livide
Qui porte un éclair au flanc.

Ils sont tout près ! - Tenons fermée
Cette salle, où nous les narguons.
Quel bruit dehors ! Hideuse armée
De vampires et de dragons !
La poutre du toit descellée
Ploie ainsi qu'une herbe mouillée,
Et la vieille porte rouillée
Tremble, à déraciner ses gonds!

Cris de l'enfer! voix qui hurle et qui pleure!
L'horrible essaim, poussé par l'aquilon,
Sans doute, ô ciel ! s'abat sur ma demeure.
Le mur fléchit sous le noir bataillon.
La maison crie et chancelle penchée,
Et l'on dirait que, du sol arrachée,
Ainsi qu'il chasse une feuille séchée,
Le vent la roule avec leur tourbillon!

Prophète ! si ta main me sauve
De ces impurs démons des soirs,
J'irai prosterner mon front chauve
Devant tes sacrés encensoirs!
Fais que sur ces portes fidèles
Meure leur souffle d'étincelles,
Et qu'en vain l'ongle de leurs ailes
Grince et crie à ces vitraux noirs!

Ils sont passés ! - Leur cohorte
S'envole, et fuit, et leurs pieds
Cessent de battre ma porte
De leurs coups multipliés.
L'air est plein d'un bruit de chaînes,
Et dans les forêts prochaines
Frissonnent tous les grands chênes,
Sous leur vol de feu pliés!

De leurs ailes lointaines
Le battement décroît,
Si confus dans les plaines,
Si faible, que l'on croit
Ouïr la sauterelle
Crier d'une voix grêle,
Ou pétiller la grêle
Sur le plomb d'un vieux toit.

D'étranges syllabes
Nous viennent encor ;
Ainsi, des arabes
Quand sonne le cor,
Un chant sur la grève
Par instants s'élève,
Et l'enfant qui rêve
Fait des rêves d'or.

Les Djinns funèbres,
Fils du trépas,
Dans les ténèbres
Pressent leurs pas;
Leur essaim gronde:
Ainsi, profonde,
Murmure une onde
Qu'on ne voit pas.

Ce bruit vague
Qui s'endort,
C'est la vague
Sur le bord;
C'est la plainte,
Presque éteinte,
D'une sainte
Pour un mort.

On doute
La nuit...
J'écoute : 
-Tout fuit,
Tout passe
L'espace
Efface
Le bruit.</poem>

Adaptations.
This extremely famous poem was set to various adaptations or transpositions in other arts, such as "Les Djinns" (op. 12, 1875) by <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a>, for mixed choir, or the <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a> "<a href="Les%20Djinns%20%28Franck%29">Les Djinns</a>" (FWV 45), composed by <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a> in 1884.

St. Joseph County Courthouse (Centreville, Michigan)

The St. Joseph County Courthouse is a government building located at 125 West Main Street in <a href="Centreville%2C%20Michigan">Centreville, Michigan</a>. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1993.

History.
Centreville was first established as the county seat of <a href="St.%20Joseph%20County%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph County</a> in 1831. The first county offices were located in a leased house. In 1841, Thomas W. Langley, donated land to the county on which to construct a courthouse and a jail, and the first county courthouse was completed the following year. In 1859, two additional office buildings were constructed. However, by the 1890s, the county buildings were becoming dilapidated, and by 1897, the need to repair or replace them had become critical. At first, the county board of supervisors adopted plans to renovate the existing courthouse, but county voters rejected the proposal. In 1899, the board adopted a plan to replace the courthouse, which was approved by voters alter that year.

A building committee was formed, and the committee selected architect Sidney J. Osgood of Grand Rapids to design this building. Ionia contractors David C Crookshank and William H. Somers were selected to construct the building. The cornerstone of the new courthouse was laid on September 7, 1899. The construction of the courthouse was completed by August 1900, at a total cost of $34,418.90. The building served to house the local courts until the 1970s, when a new two-story building was constructed south of the old courthouse. The building is still used by the county government.

Description.
The Saint Joseph County Courthouse is a rectangular, three-story, <a href="Richardsonian%20Romanesque">Richardsonian Romanesque</a> building, constructed of red brick with sandstone trim. The lower level is slightly below grade, and is faced with rock. The building has a hip and gable roof, and a square plan, pyramidal-roofed, arcaded center tower rises to 45 feet in height. The main entrances are to the north and east; these entrances display round-arch stone detailing topped by keystones. A glass-enclosed passageway to the south of the courthouse connects to the Courts Building.

On the interior, each floor is laid out in a T pattern, with the principal staircases located near the two entrances.

Cathedral Basilica of the Holy Saviour, San Salvador de Jujuy

The Cathedral Basilica of the Holy Saviour () Also San Salvador de Jujuy Cathedral Is the seat of the Catholic bishopric of the city of <a href="San%20Salvador%20de%20Jujuy">San Salvador de Jujuy</a> in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, as well as a historic building of the country. The work was declared National Historical Monument by Decree No. 1347 of May 16, 1931.

It is undoubtedly a masterpiece of the <a href="Spanish%20Colonial%20architecture">Spanish colonial style</a> of the eighteenth century. Several religious buildings were built before the present cathedral building, but were erected with materials too fragile and none resisted for a long time. It was in <a href="1736">1736</a> that the last of them was declared out of commission, and the construction of the work we know today took place. Without an exact date, it is believed that the present building was consecrated and opened between <a href="1761">1761</a> and <a href="1765">1765</a>. Since then there have been minor modifications in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

It was in this cathedral that the new Argentine flag, created by Manuel Belgrano, was blessed on May 25, <a href="1812">1812</a>. Shortly thereafter, the troops and the population of the city, gathered in front of the Cabildo and swore loyalty before her. This fact is today perpetuated by a painting by Luis De Servi, made for the centenary of the event and placed on one of the walls of the cathedral.

In it is venerated Our Lady of the Rosary of Paypaya and White River, declared in 1812 "Patron of the Armies of the North", used in the liberation of the country.

Warriors (upcoming film)

Warriors is the name given to an upcoming American <a href="live-action">live-action</a>/<a href="computer-animated">computer-animated</a> film, produced by <a href="David%20Heyman">David Heyman</a> and distributed by <a href="Alibaba%20Pictures">Alibaba Pictures</a>. It is based off of the <a href="book%20series">Warriors (novel series)</a>, by the alias writer(s) <a href="Erin%20Hunter">Erin Hunter</a>. The film will use CGI imagery but without the use of motion capture to portray the characters.

Synopsis.
A housecat named <a href="List_of_Warriors_characters%23Firestar">Rusty</a>, joins a clan named "Thunderclan" consisting of wild cats in the forest, and faces numerous challenges along the way to becoming a Thunderclan warrior.

Production.
During an author chat in 2009, Victoria Holmes stated that there were currently no plans to adapt any of the Warriors novels into movies, and none under consideration:

5 years later, October 20, 2016, Victoria Holmes announced that Alibaba Pictures had bought the rights for a movie, and are planning to do one with David Heyman set as producer. When asked about a few thoughts of his, Heyman relayed to a reporter from <a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a> his thoughts on the main character Rusty. "He's stigmatized, he's an outsider, he is not from the forest, he's lived in the comfort of a human home, So it's about him getting acclimatized into this place, earning his place in spite of great prejudice against him and ultimately rising up.".

Heyman told the reporter that he is now trying to find a screenwriter. "There are six books in the first series. It's important that we find a way so that the films doesn't feel episodic ... like a unified story,". "The interesting thing about the books is there are such a lot of narratives. And the books are still being written, so there will be as many films as long as we can keep telling interesting stories and the audience is receptive of it. We'll keep on making it.".
He has also said that the film will not be using motion capture for the cats' performance. "I think motion capture works best when there are humanoid characters — two arms, two legs. If you're doing a cat, it doesn't work. What we'll do is to film actors for reference, like what we did in Paddington.".

Thekla M. Bernays

Thekla M. Bernays (1856 - January 30, 1931) was <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage">Women's suffrage</a>'s activist, author and lecturer.

Early life and family.
Thekla M. Bernays was born in 1856, at <a href="Highland%2C%20Illinois">Highland, Illinois</a>, the daughter of Dr. George J. Bernays and Minna Bertrand. She had one brother, noted St. Louis surgeon, Dr. <a href="Augustus%20Charles%20Bernays">Augustus Charles Bernays</a> (1854-1907), of whom she would late wrote the memoirs, "Augustus Charles Bernays: A Memoir" (1912).

Dr. George J. Bernays (died 1888) was the son of Clemens Bernays and grandson of Jacob Gera Bernays. His wife Minna was the daughter of Frederick Doering, of Germany, and grand-daughter of Seris Bertrand, of France. George and Minna met in Germany but married in St. Louis at the residence of <a href="Henry%20Boernstein">Henry Boernstein</a>, well known theatrical manager and head of a newspaper at that time. 

When Bernays was young, the family moved back to Germany, but then came back to St. Louis for a few years to finally move to <a href="Lebanon%2C%20Illinois">Lebanon, Illinois</a>, in 1866.

Bernays and her brother attended <a href="McKendree%20University">McKendree College</a>. In one of the literary societies of the college, the Clionian, Bernays ranked high as an essayist, and during her junior year, her last year at McKendree, was twice elected president of the society.

Soon after Dr. A. C. Bernays' graduation from McKendree College in 1872, the family went back to Germany, and for the next five years made their home in Heidelberg. Bernays' studies were continued to study in a school for the higher education of women, since women were not admitted to the university. In May 1874, a state examination for teachers was held at Karlsruhe, the capital of the grand-duchy, Baden. Bernays, then scarcely eighteen years old, passed with flying colors, receiving the highest grade given at the examination. 
The family returned to America in the spring of 1877. In November 1888 Dr. George J. Bernays died of blood poisoning which he contracted during an operation.

In 1902 Bernays received from McKendree College the honorary degree of Master of Arts, at the time it was honor conferred by the college on only two other women in the eighty-six years of its existence. The degree was awarded for "meritorious work in the criticism of art and modern literature."

Career.
Bernays was foreign correspondent of the "<a href="St.%20Louis%20Globe-Democrat">St. Louis Globe-Democrat</a>" and contributed to "<a href="Reedy%27s%20Mirror">Reedy's Mirror</a>", the "<a href="Westliche%20Post">Westliche Post</a>", "<a href="The%20Criterion">The Criterion</a>", and other publications.

Bernays appeared many times in public as a speaker and lecturer. She delivered addresses and read papers before many societies and clubs, including the Young Men's Self-Culture Club, a similar organization for working girls, the St. Louis Negro Self-Culture Association, the Wednesday Club, the Greek Ethics Society and the Century Club. One of the papers read was printed as a Christmas souvenir, "Diplomatic Women; an Essay Read Before the Century Club of St. Louis, Mo., by Miss Thekla M. Bernays". An address delivered before the St. Louis Wednesday Club on "Postulating an American Literature," and which was printed in the "Bulletin" of Washington University, attracted much attention.

Bernays was a charter member of the St. Louis Artists Guild, 812 Union Boulevard, designed by her nephew Louis C. Spiering, maybe thanks to her recommendation; she was also a member of the Arts & Crafts jury for the St. Louis World's Fair or <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition">Louisiana Purchase Exposition</a>.

In December 1911, Thekla M. Bernays wrote a decalogue for women:

Personal life.
Thekla M. Bernays was a member of an artistic group active from 1890 to 1910, which included <a href="Zoe%20Akins">Zoe Akins</a>, <a href="Sara%20Teasdale">Sara Teasdale</a>, <a href="Orrick%20Glenday%20Johns">Orrick Glenday Johns</a> and <a href="William%20Marion%20Reedy">William Marion Reedy</a>. Reedy said of Bernays that she had the greatest woman's mind he had ever known. He found her both wise and innocent, discerning and gentle. It was Reedy who introduced Bernays to Akins, and the two women became lifelong friends.

Bernays corresponded with notable American literary figures like <a href="Gertrude%20Atherton">Gertrude Atherton</a>, <a href="Albert%20Bloch">Albert Bloch</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Frohman">Daniel Frohman</a>, <a href="Frank%20Harris">Frank Harris</a>, <a href="Mitchell%20Kennerley">Mitchell Kennerley</a>, and <a href="George%20O%27Neil">George O'Neil</a>. 

Bernays was an art collector; she owned the "The Adoration of the Shepherds" by <a href="Francesco%20Bassano%20the%20Younger">Francesco Bassano the Younger</a>, which she lent to the City Art Museum, Toronto, and is now at the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Museum%20of%20Art">North Carolina Museum of Art</a>. She owned also another version of "The Adoration of the Shepherds", the one by <a href="Leandro%20Bassano">Leandro Bassano</a>: this last she gifted to the <a href="Brooklyn%20Museum">Brooklyn Museum</a> and they sold it in 2013 through <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a>.

In 1897, Thekla adopted her nephew, Eric Simons Bernays (1884-1935), son of her sister Lily Bernays and Frederick Simons. In 1885, Eric Simons was the subject of a custody battle between his father, Simons, his mother Lily, and Lily and Thekla's father, George Bernays. In the late 1890s Thekla moved with Eric to Switzerland where he attended the Ecole de Commerce at Neufchatel. They then returned to St. Louis around 1902 and lived in the Bernays "compound". He was struck by an automobile while crossing a street and died by the injuries in 1935.

Bernays died January 30, 1931, in New York, and was buried in <a href="Bellefontaine%20Cemetery">Bellefontaine Cemetery</a> in St. Louis.

Darby Free Library

Darby Free Library, founded in 1743 in <a href="Darby%2C%20Pennsylvania">Darby, Pennsylvania</a> near Philadelphia, is one of the oldest libraries in the United States. It was organized just 12 years after <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> helped found the <a href="Library%20Company%20of%20Philadelphia">Library Company of Philadelphia</a>. Though it was a <a href="subscription%20library">subscription library</a> until 1898, it claims to be "the oldest library in the United States in continuous service." The library will celebrate its 275th anniversary in 2018.

History.
Founding.
The library was organized on March 10, 1743 by 29 Quakers as a subscription library. Joseph Bonsall was elected Secretary, Nathan Gibson, Treasurer, and John Pearson was the first Librarian. Until 1872 library meeting were held in member's houses and the librarian keep the collection of books in a trunk.

Each subscriber pledged 20 shillings to join plus 5 shillings per year to continue his membership. £11-10s Sterling was used to buy the first books from England. With the help of botanists <a href="John%20Bartram">John Bartram</a> (in America) and <a href="Peter%20Collinson%20%28botanist%29">Peter Collinson</a> (in England), who performed similar services for the Library Company of Philadelphia, the first books arrived from England on November 5, 1743, 

These books included:


Most of these books are still owned by the library and are on display there.
The library continued to buy books from London until 1761 when they began buying books from <a href="David%20Hall%20%28publisher%29">David Hall</a>, a Philadelphia bookseller and publisher. By 1761 the collection included 230 volumes.

After the Revolution.
An attempt was made in 1795 to purchase land a build a library building, but no property meeting the library's needs could be found at an affordable price. In 1819 Ann Paschall inherited a share in the library and became the first woman to be a member. She was not invited to the membership meetings however as the minutes state "her attendance at our meetings is dispensed with." In 1826 borrowing privileges were extended to anyone paying a $3 annual fee. Several books were sold from the collection soon after. One book, <a href="Samuel_Jackson_Pratt%23The_Pupil_of_Pleasure">The Pupil of Pleasure</a> that offended Quaker sensibilities, was burned. 

In 1866 property was bought to build a permanent home for the library, just south of <a href="Darby%20Meeting">the Darby Friends Meetinghouse</a> at the corner of 10th and Main Streets. The building was designed in the <a href="Italianate">Italianate</a> style by <a href="Benjamin%20D.%20Price">Benjamin D. Price</a> and constructed by Charles Bonsall. It was completed in 1872 at a cost of $8,895.54. Price was known for designing churches and the library design in many ways resembles a church.

In 1898 the library became free and open to the public.

Science Fiction (Brand New album)

Science Fiction is the fifth studio album by American <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Brand%20New%20%28band%29">Brand New</a>, released on August 17, 2017. The album is the band's first in eight years since 2009's <a href="Daisy%20%28Brand%20New%20album%29">"Daisy"</a>. The album's title and track listing were officially revealed on August 17, 2017 after several weeks of speculation, hints and leaks.

Background.
Following the release of their fourth studio album, <a href="Daisy%20%28Brand%20New%20album%29">"Daisy"</a>, in 2009, Brand New took time away from writing new music. In July of 2014, the band confirmed that they had entered the studio to begin the recording process for the new album. However, they did not officially release any new material until single entitled <a href="Mene%20%28Brand%20New%20song%29">"Mene"</a> in 2015, a discarded song from "The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me". Another new song, "Sealed to Me", was also premiered in concert. This was later followed by the release of another single, <a href="I%20Am%20a%20Nightmare">"I Am a Nightmare"</a>, in 2016. Additionally, the band officially released the batch of <a href="Leaked%20Demos%202006">leaked demos</a> from the "Devil and God" recording session, as well as an EP consisting of three demos reworked. During that time period, Brand New hinted several times through concerts and merchandise that the band would be breaking up in 2018. The band initially prepared to release their fifth album in 2016; however, they postponed the release in September 2016 after expressing dissatisfaction with the final product. 

Release.
On August 15, 2017, Brand New updated the website for their record label, <a href="Procrastinate%21%20Music%20Traitors">Procrastinate! Music Traitors</a>, allowing for pre-orders of a confirmed fifth album to be shipped in October on vinyl format in a limited quantity. A tour of the Eastern United States and Europe was announced as well.

On August 17, a <a href="Compact%20disc">CD</a> containing one 61-minute long track was shipped to people who had pre-ordered the limited edition vinyl, with each CD numbered out of 500. The track, entitled "44.5902N104.7146W" (coordinates to the <a href="Devils%20Tower">Devils Tower National Monument</a> in <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, also known as the setting for the 1977 sci-fi film <a href="Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind">"Close Encounters of the Third Kind"</a>) came with a booklet including quotes from the <a href="Poole%20versus%20HAL%209000">Poole versus HAL 9000</a> chess match scene in the 1968 sci-fi film . The track was <a href="Live%20streaming">livestreamed</a> by a fan through a <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> group, where the album title "Science Fiction", artwork, and certain track titles such as "No Control", "Desert", "Out of Mana", "In the Water" and "451", were revealed using the music identification app <a href="Shazam%20%28service%29">Shazam</a>. Later that day, the band made the album available for pre-order in vinyl, CD and digital download formats for release in October.

Packaging.
The cover is based around a photograph by Swedish artist Thobias Fäldt. The photograph features two women, Malin and Emma, seemingly jumping from a window. The packaging for the release has been created by <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> based studio Morning Breath, Inc., who also worked on the artwork for "Daisy" and "Mene".

Reception.
Chris Payne of <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a> gave the album a positive review, declaring that it is "more a part of a lineage of constantly-shape-shifting, steadfastly fascinating experimental rock bands, which famously includes Radiohead, but also the likes of Talk Talk, Swans, the Fall and a disparate many others."

Nature of the Beast (Film)

Nature of the Beast is the feature-length documentary about Labour politician <a href="Dennis%20Skinner">Dennis Skinner</a>. Produced by Liverpool-based company Shut Out The Light and directed by Daniel Draper, "Nature of the Beast" is due to be released in UK cinemas from 8th September 2017.

After interviewing Dennis for a previous project about Robert Tressell's book "<a href="The_Ragged-Trousered_Philanthropists">The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists</a>" Dennis agreed to allow Shut Out The Light to produce the first feature documentary about his life and contribution to British politics. Principal photography began in 2014 and was financed primarily through trade-union donations. Shooting was completed in the summer of 2016. A successful <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> campaign then raised the remaining funds needed to complete post-production.

The film appeared on the Doc/Player platform at the <a href="Sheffield_Doc/Fest">Sheffield International Documentary Festival</a> (2017), before playing the <a href="East_End_Film_Festival">East End Film Festival</a> (2017) and the 29th <a href="Galway_Film_Fleadh">Galway Film Fleadh</a>. There was also a feature in <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> in <a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a> weekend supplement, The New Review, in the run up to the film's release.

Synopsis.
"Nature of the Beast" documents how Dennis was raised alongside nine siblings within a mining village, his early childhood memories and how he naturally became politicised by his surroundings. From working as a miner to his rise through the local council, to when he was elected as MP for <a href="Bolsover">Bolsover</a> in 1970. Drawing reference from Dennis's love nature and the chapter in his autobiography ("Sailing Close To The Wind") titled "The Agony and The Ecstasy", the film draws upon the landscape when possible to highlight the peaks and troughs of Dennis's political career. This includes the Clay Cross Housing Finance Act dispute, the <a href="Pentonville_Five">Pentonville Five</a> protests, the <a href="United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_February_1974">1974 General Election</a> and the <a href="UK%20miners%27%20strike%20%281984%E2%80%9385%29">Miner's Strike</a> (1984-85). The film compares the ever-changing seasons of nature to the constant shifting of the political climate. "Nature of the Beast" also features Dennis's interests away from politics - his love of sports, musicals and cinema - as well as his famous quips, Black Rod comments and brief media appearances.

History.
Zhaosi Hall was built by the father of <a href="Consort%20Duan">Consort Duan</a>, a <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a> concubine of the <a href="Jiajing%20Emperor">Jiajing Emperor</a>. The building was completed in 1528 and today lies in front of the home of the <a href="Cao%20%28surname%29">Cao family</a> of Shuofang district. In 1748, descendants of the Cao family designated the building as an ancestral shrine.

Zhaosi Hall was designated a Cultural Site Protected at the Provincial Level () in 1995.

The entire building is made from a very expensive and rare type of local "<a href="Machilus">cedar</a>" wood.

Consort Duan's burial.
In 2013, archaeologists observed that a stone archway near to Zhaosi Hall was built in the style of an <a href="Emperor%20of%20China">imperial</a> memorial, but lacked an inscription. Local people reported that there had been a grave tumulus near the arch that had been levelled, suggesting that the individual buried there was the recipient of an imperial, uninscribed memorial. Additionally, the word cedar () in the original name "Xiangnan ting" sounds similar to the word for daughter in the local dialect (). Consequently, the archway is popularly believed to have been erected by Cao Ji in memory of his daughter.

Onagam is located in center of <a href="Bandipora">Bandipora</a> district, 2 kilometers away from the district head quarters. Surrounded by Panjigam from East, Putushai from west, Duban from North Qazipora from South, Turqpora from North West, and Kalusa from South East.

A beautiful canal(nehr Zainagir) passes through the village and divides it into two halves- longitudinally, this canal was built by Badshah, an irrigation canal to irrigate Zainagir(a remote village in sopore- Apple Town) thus the name Nehr Zainagir(The Zainagir Canal). It is 47 Kms long, takes its water from the river Madhumati. It flows through Bandipore on the bank of the Wullar Lake at Sonawari. It moves in loops till it enters Sopore irrigating about 13300 acres of land. This canal adds its beauty to this village.

WaterFalls & Zainager Canal: 

ZAINAGER: name of a pgn. between the Wular lake and the Pohru river developed by Zain-ul-Abdin (1420-1470 A.D.) by raising a dam of boulders across the Pohru to provide water for irrigation in the tract. Zain-ul-Abdin constructed the Zainager Canal and started building places, the chaks, who appear to have remained untamed so far. The purpose of constructing Nehr-e-Zainager (Zainager Canal) was to irrigate Zainager, it originates from Sonarwani, and flows through Watrina, Panjigam, Onagam, Potushai... and so on... and finally reaches to Zainager(village). It moves in loops till it enters Sopore irrigating about 13300 acres of land. It is 47 Kms long, takes its water from the river Madhumati.
Panchakki,(Grutt- Kashmiri) also known as the water mill, is used to grind grain. The water-mill is kept fed with sufficient water, the arrangement is such that the water is made to fall into the Chakki's cistern from quite a height in order to generate the necessary power to drive the mill. Onagam(My Village) is blessed with a Panchakki located near to twin water falls. The main water resource to this chakki is Nehr Zainagair( Badshal Canal). A few gallons of water is allowed to flow through a small stream towards the panchakki, and once the purpose of running the grinder is served, water is allowed to flow back into Badshah Canal.Onagam's Grutt keeps serving people from distant areas almost throughout the year... Except for Nov, Dec, and Jan.. it keeps running thoughout the year.

Louvre castle

The Louvre castle was a <a href="castle">castle</a> built the by King <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip-Augustus</a> to reinforce the walls he had built around Paris to protect the city. It was demolished steps by steps to make way for the <a href="Louvre%20Palace">Louvre Palace</a>.

The fortress.
Before his departure for the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a> in 1190, Philip-Augustus wants to protect Paris his capital, especially against English soldiers which were in Normandy. He also wants to have a safe place for his treasure, as well as for his archives that he lost at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fr%C3%A9teval">Battle of Fréteval</a> in 1194 against <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard the Lionheart</a> and which he had since reconstructed .

He build the <a href="Wall%20of%20Philip%20II%20Augustus">enclosure which bears his name</a>, around Paris. From 1190 to 1209 on the right bank, from 1200 to 1215 on the left bank less exposed. The Louvre castle stands on the west, the most exposed side because English soldiers occupy Normandy far from 100 km only. It is also from downstream of the Seine river that came the <a href="Siege%20of%20Paris%20%28845%29">Norman invasion of 845</a>.

The castle is composed of a approximately square (78 m by 72 m) fortress, surrounded by a moat of about 10 meters wide fed by the water of the nearby Seine rivrer. The wall on the west side, overlooking the countryside and judged the most exposed, is thicker and doorless. The perimeter is reinforced by ten defensive towers, especially at the corners. There are two doors, the main one to the south and the Seine river and a smaller one to the east and the city. They are protected by a <a href="drawbridge">drawbridge</a> and framed by two twin towers. Two buildings housing the garrisons and arsenals are placed outside the surrounding wall, to the west and south of the central courtyard. The towers are not far more than 25 m, the distance corresponding to the effective range of a bow. They are pierced with <a href="arrowslit">arrowslit</a>s to cover the ramparts.

The set of curtains and walls have slightly sloped bases, with the aim of hampering <a href="sapping">sapping</a> attempts and to facilitate the rebound of projectiles thrown from the summits against attacking soldiers.

In the center of the courtyard is a dungeon named the "Grosse Tour" (=Big Tower) built in 1200. It is circular 15.6 meters in diameter with a wall thickness of 4.25 meters at its base and a height of 30 meters . It is surrounded by a ditch 9 meters wide and 6 meters deep. This ditch is dry (not flooded), paved with large irregular stones. It is crossed by a <a href="drawbridge">drawbridge</a>. The interior volumes are vaulted in stone to limit the risk of fire. The dungeon has a slate conical roof over the <a href="machicolation">machicolation</a>. It has a well and a large tank for supporting a long seat, and also a chapel.

Philippe Auguste had chosen by experience to build a round dungeon and not square or rectangular for military reasons. Indeed, the enemy pioneers could more easily carry out a sapping work on each side of an angle of a square tower than on the wall of a tower of circular plane.

The dungeon had an initially military function (ultimate refuge of the king), but it housed essentially the archives and the royal treasure no doubt until <a href="Philippe%20le%20Bel">Philippe le Bel</a>. It was also used as a prison until the 14th century. <a href="Ferdinand%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Ferdinand, Count of Flanders</a> defeated and captured at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bouvines">Battle of Bouvines</a> in 1214 was imprisoned here for thirteen years.

The work ends in 1202.

This castle is the main example of the "philipian architecture" 

The royal residence.
Under the King <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a>, the castle was enlarged, new rooms were built without any real defensive purpose, like the Salle Saint-Louis (1230-1240).

At the time of the King <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V of France</a>, which reigned from 1364 to 1380, Paris extended widely beyond the walls of Philippe-Auguste. The king built a new enclosure, which encompasses these new quarters, as well as the Louvre castle : The <a href="Wall%20of%20Charles%20V">Wall of Charles V</a>. So, the castle lost much of its military interest. Then the King decided to sacrifice some military devices of the castle to make it more habitable as a safe royal residence. Especially after the riot of February 22nd, 1358 led by the Provost of merchants <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Marcel">Étienne Marcel</a> threatening the king inside the <a href="Palais%20de%20la%20Cit%C3%A9">Palais de la Cité</a>.

His architect <a href="Raymond%20du%20Temple">Raymond du Temple</a> adds turrets, statues and habitable surfaces, creates gardens, pierces wider openings. King Charles V builds the First Royal Library by transforming the northwest tower (tower of the Falconry) into a tower of the Librairie which contains nine hundred manuscripts.

The miniatures of the manuscript of the "<a href="Tr%C3%A8s%20Riches%20Heures%20du%20Duc%20de%20Berry">Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry</a>" (=Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry) show the castle of the Louvre at that time. They give an idea of the general aspect of the fortress, although at that time aesthetic or comfort arrangements were made to the detriment of military concerns.

During the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>, the English soldiers commanded by <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V of England</a>, allied to the Burgundian mastering of Paris, entered the city on December 1, 1420, and occupied without a fight the Louvre castle. They find the city ruined by civil war and scarcity. They will stay there until 1436.

A progressive demolition to give place to the <a href="Cour%20Carr%C3%A9e">Cour Carrée</a>.
In 1525, the King <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a> was defeated and made prisonner in Pavia. During his captivity, in Paris, the Court interfered by the use of its right of remonstrance, the faculty of theology and the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Paris">Parliament of Paris</a> shown some independance. The king held a <a href="lit%20de%20justice">lit de justice</a> on 24, 26 and 27 July 1526 during which he demonstrated his authority and decided to take over his kingdom by making the Louvre his main residence in Paris. As a symbol of his authority, he orders to demolish the dungeon in 1528 in order to build an Italian palace. In 1546, he entrusts to the architect <a href="Pierre%20Lescot">Pierre Lescot</a> the project of building a modern palace in the spirit of Renaissance architecture with a large hotel particulier and ceremonial rooms. After the death of the king (1547), his son <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II of France</a> continues work by Pierre Lescot. He destroys the west wall (from December 1546 to March 1549) to build the ballroom, as well as the south wall, to erect the royal pavilion (1553-1556) housing the royal apartments and the small gallery.

After the death of Henry II, his widow <a href="Catherine%20de%27%20Medici">Catherine de' Medici</a> continues the development of the south wing for her apartments.

Under <a href="Henri%20III%20of%20France">Henri III of France</a>, the Louvre becomes the space of monarchical power, a place of entertainment and the theater of historical events (for example the marriage of the future King <a href="Henri%20IV%20of%20France">Henri IV of France</a> with <a href="Margaret%20of%20Valois">Margaret of Valois</a> which led to the <a href="St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Day%20massacre">St. Bartholomew's Day massacre</a> in 1572.

Since 1564, the queen Catherine de' Medici favors the construction of the new <a href="Tuileries%20Palace">Tuileries Palace</a> and the establishment of a large <a href="Gardens%20of%20the%20French%20Renaissance">Renaissance garden</a>.
<a href="Henri%20IV%20of%20France">Henri IV of France</a> destroys the remaining elements on the south side, including the ditch, in order to build the "Great Gallery" or the Reunion of the Louvre and the Tuileries, completed in 1610. It also begins the construction of the <a href="Cour%20Carr%C3%A9e">Cour Carrée</a> (=Square courtyard) on the base of the already built Lescot wing. The surface is multiplied by four compared to the surface of the medieval court. He also destroys some buildings between the two palaces. This project, named "le Grand Dessein" (=The Large Wish), had also a military function : by establishing a covered walkway between the Louvre and the Tuileries outside the city walls, Henry IV has created a gallery that allows him to flee on horseback in the event of a riot.

In order to establish his power, on April 24th, 1617, the young King <a href="Louis%20XIII%20of%20France">Louis XIII of France</a> murdered <a href="Concino%20Concini">Concino Concini</a> the favorite of the Queen <a href="Anne%20of%20Austria">Anne of Austria</a> his mother in the gate of the castle in the city.

He demolished the northern part of the medieval enclosure in order to extend the Lescot wing in this direction for a search of symmetry. And <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a> the eastern part to allow the construction of the <a href="Perrault%27s%20Colonnade">Perrault's Colonnade</a>.

The remnants of the medieval Louvre.
During the 19th century, it was found that the keep and two of the four walls were only erased and the ditches filled with stones during the destruction of the castle for the construction of the Louvre.

During the construction of the Great Louvre, the bases of the keep and of these two walls were cleared. A major excavation campaign resulted with the discovery of hundreds of objects of everyday life. They are now accessible to the public in a collections named Medieval Louvre. As well as the lower room (now known as the Salle Saint-Louis) and those objects of everyday life found during excavations (small games, jugs, flasks ...)

Emma Lu Davis

Emma Lu Davis (1905-1988; also spelled Emma Lou Davis) was an American sculptor, painter, and anthropologist.

Biography.
Early life and education.
She was born in Indianapolis on November 26, 1905. After graduating from <a href="Vassar%20College">Vassar College</a> in 1927, she studied for three years at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. 

Career.
After leaving school, Davis spent three years as a freelancer working on a variety of commissions. In 1933 she spent six months studying modern techniques and design under <a href="Buckminster%20Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a> at the Dymaxion factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. At the factory, she wrote later, she learned "the principles of good workmanship. I think there are a great many 'artists' but awfully few real craftsmen. Use of tools and neat, fast, strong construction are not taught much in art schools." It was there that she learned how to work with wood, and began experimenting with abstract forms. Her figurative sculptures from the 1930s reflect her interest in the naive art of various folk cultures; for example, "Grotesque Bull" (shown), a terra cotta sculpture which was included in Dorothy Miller's "Americans 1942" exhibition at MoMA.
In spring 1935 she traveled to Russia to learn how Russian artists were organized and how socialized patronage affected their work. She concluded that Soviet artists failed to innovate because "the cheap academic traditions have been continued under the name of 'socialist realism'—that is, all the facts and none of the meaning of the subject." 

From 1938 to 1941 she was the artist in residence at <a href="Reed%20College">Reed College</a> in Portland, Oregon. She describes this period as "the most profitable and enjoyable three years of my life." In 1939 she was commissioned by the federal <a href="Treasury%20Section%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Treasury Section of Fine Arts</a> to paint a mural, "Missouri Livestock," for the post office in <a href="La%20Plata%2C%20Missouri">La Plata, Missouri</a>. Two years later she collaborated with Henry Kreis on a series of low-relief granite sculptures depicting the benefits of social security for the overdoor panels of the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a> building in Washington, D.C.

After practicing as a commercial artist for thirty years, Davis decided to retrain as an archaeologist. She completed her Ph.D. at UCLA in 1965, writing her dissertation on the early archaeology of the <a href="Panamint%20Valley">Panamint Valley</a>. She worked at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Museum%20of%20Man">San Diego Museum of Man</a>, while continuing her desert studies, focusing on the southern California region of <a href="China%20Lake">China Lake</a>. Prior to her retirement, she established the Great Basin Foundation, which conducted paleo-environmental research. According to Joseph L. Chartkoff, Davis was "one of the most important figures in bringing scientific rigor and credibility to Paleoindian archaeology in California."

Death and legacy.
She died in San Diego on October 19, 1988. Her artwork is included in the collections of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>, the <a href="Whitney%20Museum%20of%20American%20Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>, and other museums and private collectors.

Murder of Jenny Nicholl

Jenny Nicholl was a 19 year-old woman who disappeared sometime on or after 30 June 2005 from the <a href="Richmond%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Richmond</a> area, <a href="North%20Yorkshire">North Yorkshire</a>, England. In February 2008, David Hodgson was convicted of her murder despite the <a href="Murder%20conviction%20without%20a%20body">lack of a body</a>, crime scene or body deposition site. Hodgson was jailed for life, with a recommendation that he serve at least 18 years, after being convicted on <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and fake text messaging evidence which involved him travelling many miles so as to appear that Nicholl was still alive and camping some distance away from her home town.

Disappearance.
The Nicholl family lived in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where Nicholl worked at the local supermarket and played guitar in pub bands. Nicholl's father was in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and the family settled in Richmond when the eldest son also joined the army and was posted to <a href="Catterick%20Garrison">Catterick</a>. On the 30 June 2005, Nicholl told her parents that she was spending the night with friends, which was not uncommon for her, and took items with her that suggested she was going on a camping trip. She left the house at 6:00 pm that evening and it was the last confirmed sighting of Nicholl. Nicholl was reported missing by her parents on 4 July 2005 after they had had no contact with her over the previous days and her car (a white <a href="Rover%20214">Rover 214i</a>) was found parked in the Holly Hill Pub in Richmond.

Nine days later, <a href="North%20Yorkshire%20Police">North Yorkshire Police</a> interviewed David Hodgson, who was 45 at the time of Nicholl's disappearance, was a married father of two, and who had been Nicholls' boyfriend since she was 14 year's old, though he maintained that their relationship was not sexual until she was 16 and that they had only had sex five times. Hodgson's two daughters had both attended the same school as Nicholl (<a href="St%20Francis%20Xavier%20School">St Francis Xavier School</a> in Richmond). Around the time of the affair starting, it was said that there was some name-calling of Nicholl and eventually an assault in which the police were finally involved.

During his first police interview, Hodgson denied having an affair with Nicholl and also denied anything to do with her disappearance. The next day, Nicholl's mobile phone was switched on and messages were sent which led her family and the police to believe that she was alive and well. The text messages were later revealed to have been sent from locations as far afield as <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a> in <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a> and <a href="Jedburgh">Jedburgh</a> in the <a href="Scottish%20Borders">Scottish Borders</a>. Later, the authenticity of these messages were put into doubt by the police when they stated in November 2005 that the inquiry had turned from a disappearance into a murder investigation. At the end of July 2005, police found David Hodgson in a hut near to <a href="Hudswell%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Hudswell</a>. He had taken an overdose of pills and wine. In later police interviews, Hodgson admitted that he and Nicholl were lovers, but that their affair had ended 12 months earlier.

Whilst there was some initial hope with the mobile phone messages (Ann Nicholl went to both locations to search for her daughter), police still maintained an active search for Nicholl which lasted for the rest of the summer of 2005 and involved searching over 150 areas, septic tanks at farms and also utilised soldiers from <a href="Catterick%20Garrison">Catterick Garrison</a> to help out.

During the investigation it was revealed that Nicholl had also started seeing Hodgson's elder brother, Robert, in the weeks prior to her disappearance. Robert Hodgson was unaware of Nicholl being linked with his younger brother, despite the two brothers erecting the huts in Sandbeck Plantation that critical evidence was found at during, and after the police searches. In December 2005, Ann Nicholl appeared on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> programme <a href="Crimewatch">Crimewatch</a> to appeal for help in finding her daughter and the conviction of her killer.

In May 2007, police formally charged David Hodgson, and he appeared that same month in <a href="Northallerton">Northallerton</a> Magistrates Court where he was remanded in custody until a trial early in 2008.

Conviction.
The case came to court in January 2008 where Hodgson denied taking Nicholl to any of his ramshackle huts hidden in the Sandbeck Plantation near to the <a href="A6136%20road">A6136 road</a>, south of Richmond. DNA evidence contradicted this as did the discovery of Nicholl's nightdress, teddy bear and cassette player at the same location. Police believed that Hodgson became jealous of his brother's relationship with Nicholl and he killed her on the night she disappeared. Hodgson's elder daughter, stated in court that Nicholl was seen alive in Richmond two days after her disappearance and had been staying with her uncle (Hodgson's elder brother). Robert Hodgson denied this claim and stated in court that he had not seen Nicholl for some time.

At court, the prosecution were able to establish that the text messages sent to family and friends days after her disappearance were not in the style that Nicholl would typically compose. The prosecution also submitted evidence that Hodgson had hired a car on two separate occasions (the 9 and 14 July 2005) and the distances travelled on those days fitted the distances both there and back from Richmond to Carlisle and Richmond to Jedburgh. The dates also married up with the dates that the messages were sent from Nicholl's phone. The prosecution also said that David Hodgson was an intensely jealous man who was angry about Nicholl's new relationship with his brother, Robert.

In February 2008, Hodgson was found guilty of Nicholl's murder at <a href="Teesside">Teesside</a> Crown Court.

Aftermath.
In September 2008, the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners recognised <a href="Forensic%20Linguistics">Forensic Linguistics</a> as a speciality. The UK government body, which strives to promote excellence in forensic practice, recognised that evidence given in cases like those against Hodgson and <a href="Stuart%20Cable">Stuart Cable</a> (the murderer of <a href="Danielle%20Jones%20%28murder%20victim%29">Danielle Jones</a>, whose body, like Nicholl's, has never been found) had a significant impact on each case.

In November 2009, a coroner ruled that Nichol was dead and that her death was judged to be an unlawful killing.

Charlotte-Françoise de Saint-Laurent

Charlotte-Françoise de Saint-Laurent (1660-1732) was a Canadian feudal countess, fief holder and business person.

In 1702, she purchased the island <a href="%C3%8Ele%20d%E2%80%99Orl%C3%A9ans">Île d’Orléans</a>, which was formally the feudal fief county of Saint-Laurent, thereby making her ruling countess de Saint-Laurent in her own right. She kept her title even after her marriage, and also secured her son's right to it as her successor. To hold a noble title and a feudal fief, particularly after marriage, was most unusual and controversial for a woman, and even more so in the colony of Canada, were her right to it was questioned and she was sued as an usurper to it in court. Until 1713, she was forced to defend her right to the county in several high profile court cases. Charlotte-Françoise de Saint-Laurent was additionally a major business entrepreneur. Also in this aspect, she was unusual: married women were legally wards under their husband's guardianship and could thus not formally engage in business, but as her spouse signed a <a href="power%20of%20attorney">power of attorney</a> enabling her to do so, she was able to do it anyway.

Société d'économie politique

The Société d’Economie Politique () is a French learned society concerned with <a href="political%20economy">political economy</a>. It was founded in 1842 to provide a forum for discussion of free trade, a subject of violent debate at the time, and has continued to organize discussions on economic and social issues to the present day.

History.
The Société d’Économie Politique was founded on 1 February 1842 in Paris.
It was founded by the followers of <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Say">Jean-Baptiste Say</a> to provide an open forum for debate on economics at a time when there were violent arguments over free trade.
The society was led informally by <a href="Pellegrino%20Rossi">Pellegrino Rossi</a> as president and Count Ferdinand-Charles-Philippe d' Esterno (1805–83) as secretary.
The debates were very academic in nature, and the society dissolved after a few meetings.
Members included Louis Leclerc, <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Cl%C3%A9ment">Jean-Pierre Clément</a>, Hippolyte Dusard, <a href="Marie%20Roch%20Louis%20Reybaud">Louis Reybaud</a>, <a href="Louis%20Wolowski">Louis Wolowski</a>, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Faucher">Léon Faucher</a>, Horace Émile Say (1794–1860), son of Jean-Baptiste Say, Théodore Fix, <a href="Charles%20Dunoyer">Charles Dunoyer</a>, <a href="Michel%20Chevalier">Michel Chevalier</a>, <a href="Hippolyte%20Passy">Hippolyte Passy</a> and <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me-Adolphe%20Blanqui">Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui</a>.

Three friends, Adolphe-Gustave Blaise (1811–86), <a href="Joseph%20Garnier">Joseph Garnier</a> (1813–81) and Gilbert Guillaumin (1801–64) decided to form a freer and more accessible society in which the sessions would be both enjoyable and instructive.
It would meet once a month to dine and discuss political economy. 
This idea was accepted, and the first meeting of five people was held on 15 November 1842 including Blaise, Garnier, Guillaumin and Eugène Daire (1798–1847).
The numbers grew with successive meetings, including those from the Rossi-d'Esterno group and others.
The society was open to men with very different positions in life and diverse political views, most of them influential either through their position or their writings.
They could meet on neutral scientific grounds to exchange views on subjects such as the functions of the state, land rents, commercial freedom, public finances, the <a href="Cr%C3%A9dit%20Foncier%20de%20France">Crédit Foncier</a>, regulations and socialism.
The central theme was always political economy.

Until 1845 the society had no formal leadership, but each meeting had a president, generally <a href="Pellegrino%20Rossi">Pellegrino Rossi</a>, who chaired the discussion.
In 1845 the society elected two presidents (<a href="Charles%20Dunoyer">Charles Dunoyer</a> and <a href="Hippolyte%20Passy">Hippolyte Passy</a>), two vice-presidents (Horace Émile Say and <a href="Charles%20Renouard">Charles Renouard</a>), a secretary, who became permanent in 1849 (Joseph Garnier) and a quaestor (Gilbert Guillaumin).
In 1845 it was absorbed by the Société des économistes.
In 1847 this society changed its name to the Société d’Economie Politique.
By 1852 there were about sixty members from the legislature, administration, industry, commerce, teaching, law, letters and contributors to the "Journal des Économistes".
Distinguished visitors to Paris were invited to the meetings.

<a href="%C3%89mile%20Mireaux">Émile Mireaux</a> was a member of the Société d'économie politique in Paris.
He served as its secretary-general from 1930 to 1937, then president from 1937 to 1940.
He belonged to the young school that helped adapt the old orthodox doctrines to the modern economy.

As of 2017 the society had almost 450 members, and included academics, business executives and senior civil servants.
It continued to provide a forum for discussion of economic and social issues.
Once a month the society organizes a dinner-debate at the Cercle de l’Union Interalliée, with a personality invited to present their views on a specific topic.
Since 1846 the society has published the "Annales d’économie politique", which contains papers and debates from the past academic season.

In accordance with the custom of the period, the boys and girls should be placed in gender segregated schools, and the girls educated by a woman teacher. In France, such a position would normally be given to a nun (the school for boys were managed by the monks in Port Royal), but as there were no nunnery in Port Royal, a secular woman educator must be given the position. Madame de Brice was given the position, and according to reports, she managed the school for girls in Port Royal very well; she also functioned as the governess for the children of the French governor of the colony. When the governor died in 1650, Madame de Brice was imprisoned. She was released in 1652, and are presumed to have returned to France after her release.

Was a <a href="Freemason">Freemason</a>, and <a href="Caleb%20Blood%20Smith">Caleb Blood Smith</a>, a cabinet member under President Lincoln, is according to some war and post-war reports his half-brother.

As of the end of the civil war he was married, and had at least one son Leon B. Smith.

Pre-Civil War career.
A mariner from the age of 13, by the time he was 20 Smith was in command of the United States mail steamship "Pacific" that sailed between San Francisco and Panama.

According to some sources he served in the <a href="Texas%20Navy">Texas Navy</a> during the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> period.

He met <a href="John%20B.%20Magruder">John B. Magruder</a> in the late 1840s when engaged in shipping on the West coast. In the 1850s he sailed in the Gulf of Mexico, working for the Southern Mail Steamship Company.

Civil War.
1861 - December 1862.
In February 1861 he was the captain of the steamer "General Rusk" and transported General <a href="John%20Salmon%20Ford">John Salmon Ford</a> and his troops to the mouth of the Rio Grande to receive the surrender of Union Major <a href="Fitz%20John%20Porter">Fitz John Porter</a>. Unattached to either side, Smith then contracted with Major Porter to transport the Union troops to New York.

In April 1861, back in the Mexican Gulf, he and his ship "General Rusk" volunteered for service for the Confederates. On April 18, 1861, Smith and his ship assisted Colonel <a href="Earl%20Van%20Dorn">Earl Van Dorn</a> in the capture of "<a href="Star%20of%20the%20West">Star of the West</a>" (notable for being the target of the first shots of the civil war on January 9, 1861 in Fort Sumter) off <a href="Matagorda%20Bay">Matagorda Bay</a> via trickery: pulling alongside her under the pretense of transferring "friendly" troops which were expected from the transport "Fashion". Smith reportedly replying to a hail from "Star of the West" with "The General Rusk with troops on board. Can you take our line now ?" and explaining that the "Fashion" would be arriving later with the luggage and the rest of the troops. The boarding troops promptly seized the "Star of the West" at bayonet point.

Between October 1861 and December 1862 Smith and the "General Rusk" were under the command of commander William W. Hunter. On the 7th of November 1861, Smith and the "General Rusk" extinguished the fire and towed back the stricken "Royal Yacht" following her encounter with "<a href="USS%20Santee%20%281855%29">USS Santee</a>".

December 1862 - January 1863: Appointment to command, Battle of Galveston.
Following the retreat from Galveston in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Galveston%20Harbor%20%281862%29">Battle of Galveston Harbor (1862)</a>, General <a href="Paul%20Octave%20H%C3%A9bert">Paul Octave Hébert</a> was relieved from command and replaced in November 1862 by General <a href="John%20B.%20Magruder">John B. Magruder</a> who arrived in Texas. Previously acquainted with Smith, in December Magruder placed Smith in charge of all the steamers at his disposal.

On Christmas Day 1862, Smith was charged with hastily improvising the "<a href="CS%20Bayou%20City">CS Bayou City</a>", "<a href="CS%20Neptune">CS Neptune</a>", along with the tenders "Lucy Gwinn" and the "John F. Carr" for battle as improvised <a href="Cottonclad%20warship">Cottonclad warship</a>s. The "Bayou City" was outfitted with a single 32-pounder rifled cannon and the "Neptune" with two 24-pounders howitzers. Cotton bales were used to provide a semblance of protection that was somewhat effective in stopping small arm fire, however when asked by a soldier about artillery protection Smith bluntly replied: "None whatsover... our only chance is to get alongside before they hit us". Boarding devices resembling the Roman <a href="Corvus%20%28boarding%20device%29">Corvus</a> were placed on the hurricane deck of each boat. Facing Smith's forces were vastly superior Union naval forces: , , , , , , and four smaller vessels.

The attack initially planned for 27 December 1862 was delayed to New Year's Eve, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Galveston">Battle of Galveston</a>. Smith's force was to attack from sea into the Harbor as General Magruder attacked from land crossing over the railroad trestle connecting the island to the mainland. Smith was to wait to be signaled by gunfire that the battle had begun, which was expected to occur at midnight. However, Magruder's forces were delayed by the difficulty of crossing his artillery over the trestle. After no signal came after midnight passed, Smith pulled back from the harbor to Red Fish Bar, a point fourteen miles away. Hearing the attack commencing at 04:00, Smith directed the naval contingent back to the harbor, probably reaching it an hour after the initial shots were fired.
Attacking just before daybreak, the "CS Neptune" was severely damaged and sunk, but Smith, aboard the "CS Bayou City" managed ram into the "Harriet Lane", board, and capture her, reportedly personally killing US Navy Commander <a href="Jonathan%20Mayhew%20Wainwright%20%281821%E2%80%931863%29">Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright</a> and recovering a valuable signal book. Though still outnumbered, Smith demanded the surrender of US fleet from commander <a href="William%20B.%20Renshaw">William B. Renshaw</a> who had run aground aboard the "USS Westfield". While under the flag of truce, Renshaw blew up his vessal and died in the explosion. Smith boarded the "USS John F. Carr" and captured her as well, while the rest of the US Navy ships escaped to sea. Aboard the captured "USS John F. Carr", Smith gave chase to the fleeing Union ships, however the small ship was unable to match the speed of the larger warships. Turning around back to the bay, Smith captured three small Union ships (the "Cavallo", "Elias Pike", and "Lecompte") with their cargo.

Following the battle, Smith won praise for his gallant conduct, including a mention in a joint resolution of the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Congress of the Confederate States</a>. General Magruder attempted to secure a regular Naval commission as <a href="commander">commander</a> for him, one of several repeated attempts, which did not result in an actual commission being granted.

January 1863 - August 1864.
Following the battle, the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Navy">Confederate States Navy</a> sent Lieutenant <a href="Joseph%20Nicholson%20Barney">Joseph Nicholson Barney</a> to take charge of naval operations in Galveston, including the captured "Harriet Lane". However, after discussions with Magruder who was not willing to relinquish control of the cottonclads, Barney conceded the appointment, and in a letter to <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Confederate naval secretary</a> <a href="Stephen%20Mallory">Stephen Mallory</a> recommended that the Navy relinquish control. Barney later explained that he made his recommendation since he considered that the presence of two separate marine forces with independent commanders would lead to discord and confusion.

Smith remained in charge of all vessels in Texas, and by order of General Magruder appointed "Commander, <a href="Texas%20Marine%20Department">Marine Department of Texas</a>".

On September 5, 1863 he was at <a href="Orange%2C%20Texas">Orange, Texas</a> inspecting the Texas and New Orleans Railroad. On September 8 he was at <a href="Beaumont%2C%20Texas">Beaumont, Texas</a> when a Union force under the command of Major General <a href="William%20B.%20Franklin">William B. Franklin</a> with four gunboats, eighteen transports, and 5,000 infantry assaulted up the <a href="Sabine%20River%20%28Texas%E2%80%93Louisiana%29">Sabine River</a> in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Sabine%20Pass">Second Battle of Sabine Pass</a>. Smith immediately ordered all Confederate troops in Beaumont, some eighty men, aboard the steamer "Roebuck" and sent them down the river to reinforce Fort Griffin. Smith and a Captain Good rode to the fort on horseback, reaching the fort some three hours before the steamer, arriving just as the Union gunboats and "<a href="USS%20Sachem%20%281861%29">Sachem</a>" came within range of Fort Griffin, which was manned by forty-seven troops. Assisting in the defense of the Fort, Smith took charge of the "Clifton" and "Sachem" which were captured during the battle which was one of the most one-sided Confederate victories of the war: no Confederate losses versus 200 killed, wounded or captured Union troops and two lost gunships.

From November to December 1863 he was sent by Magruder to direct the naval side of the defense of <a href="Indianola%2C%20Texas">Indianola, Texas</a>, where Colonel William R. Bradfute was commanding the land forces. As part of the engagement, the Confederates retreated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Esperanza">Battle of Fort Esperanza</a>. Smith commanded "John F. Carr", "Cora", and eleven small vessels with sharpshooters and artillery; however disagreements with Bradfute were a hindrance to operations. Smith chose not to take the offensive, fighting defensively.

In early 1864 Brig. Gen. <a href="William%20Steele%20%28general%29">William Steele</a>, who was given command of Galveston, attempted to take control of the naval forces there, however Magruder asserted Smith's authority.

In the summer of 1864, due to better land fortifications and the developing state of the war (most Texas troops were transferred to Louisiana in March), the marine contingent was less needed and Smith was relieved from duty at his request by Captain Henry S. Lubbock (the brother of governor <a href="Francis%20Lubbock">Francis Lubbock</a> and who had been the captain of "CS Bayou City" (Smith's flagship) in the Battle of Galveston) who commanded the marine department sub-district at Galveston. Smith was ordered by Magruder to report "by letter" to the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Confederate States Secretary of the Navy</a>.

August 1864 - June 1865.
By 1864, Smith was well known by name, to Federal authorities. Following a news report in the "Houston Daily Telegraph" that Smith was going to be sent to London to acquire a fast steamboat for privateering, that was reprinted by New York papers, Federal authorities attempted to disrupt the alleged scheme.

Smith, however, did not depart Texas immediately, and in September 1864 he captured the US schooner "Florence Bearn" at the mouth of the Rio Grande. In November 1864 he was in <a href="Havana">Havana</a> where his presence was noted by Union officials, and where he detained by Spanish authorities for a time. He subsequently piloted the steamer "Wren" to Galveston through the Union blockade. In an April 1865 letter Magruder writes that Smith will bring in a valuable Confederate steamer probably in the next dark moon. On the 20th of June 1865 he reportedly left Texas with other notable Confederate figures.

Post Civil war.
Following the war he was for a time at Havana, then went to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> where his wife and son were living, and was involved in steamer operations along the western coast.
By 1869, following the <a href="Alaska%20Purchase">Alaska Purchase</a>, he was at <a href="Fort%20Stikine%23Fort%20Wrangel">Fort Wrangel</a> Alaska with his family. In Fort Wrangel, he operated a trading post and bowling alley in partnership with William King Lear. On October 29, 1869 he was involved in a beating of an Indian who he believed struck his son, Leon B., though later Smith discovered this was not the case.

On the 25th of December 1869 a <a href="Stikine%20people">Stikine Indian</a> named Lowan bit off Mrs. Jaboc Muller's third right finger, and was killed in an ensuing fight by soldiers who mortally wounded an additional Stikine Indian. The following morning, Scutd-doo, who was the father of the deceased, entered the fort and shot Smith fourteen times. Smith died some 13 hours later. The US army made an ultimatum demanding Sccutd-doo's surrender, and following bombardment of the Stikine Indian village, the villagers handed Scutd-doo over to the military in the fort, where he was court-martialed and publicly hanged before the garrison and assembled natives on 29 December, stating before he was hanged that he had acted in revenge against the occupants of the fort for the killing of Lowan and not against Smith in particular. Smith's body was sent for burial in San Francisco, and possibly onward to Texas in the city cemetery in Houston.

Planet of the Apes: Last Frontier

Planet of the Apes: Last Frontier is an upcoming 2017 video game based on the "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Planet of the Apes</a>" franchise. Taking place between "<a href="Dawn%20of%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a>" (2014) and "<a href="War%20for%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">War for the Planet of the Apes</a>" (2017), the game was announced by <a href="Andy%20Serkis">Andy Serkis</a> during an interview on "War". It will be released in Fall 2017.

Gameplay.
"Planet of the Apes: Last Frontier" will take story cues from the film, aiming to be just as morally ambiguous, with no heroes or villains and no black or white decisions.

Players will control a cast of humans and apes throughout the game, who can live or die based on your decisions. Like many decision-making narratives, there will be multiple endings possible depending on what actions you take.

Further, the game seeks to be an even closer intersection between games and films than similar products, such as Telltale titles. It will run between 2-3 hours and the player’s only input <a href="Interactive%20fiction">will be entirely choice-based decisions</a>. There are no puzzles, no exploration, nor any direct control over characters.

Plot.
"Planet of the Apes: Last Frontier" is notably set around a year after "<a href="Dawn%20of%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a>", and is centered around a breakaway faction of apes who take refuge in the Rocky Mountains from the chaotic and still ongoing ape vs human war. However, the apes soon find themselves forced to descend into a human-owned valley as Winter approaches and food is runs low.

Development.
<a href="Andy%20Serkis">Andy Serkis</a> mentioned in October 2016 that "<a href="War%20for%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">War for the Planet of the Apes</a>" would be accompanied by a video game, for which he performed motion capture. In August 2017, the game has been announced as "Planet of the Apes: Last Frontier", which will be released for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> and <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a> in fall 2017.

Palmer Productions, was released in the United States on September 11, 2001, while a European version was released on September 27, 2001.

Reception.
On <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>, the Game Boy Color version has a rating of 27 percent.

Alex Huntala of "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" wrote about the Game Boy Color version, "There are some nice cutscenes and even a pretty cool intro that's very stylish for Game Boy, but at the end of the day, the game is rather simple and one from which you'll soon tire." "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" wrote "we'll never play this game again. MIB looks great on the GB Color, but the gameplay is complete misery."

Peer Schneider of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> called the Game Boy Color version "a very formulaic action game with little variety and sub-par gameplay. Both the game speed and the control feel much too sluggish for a shooter, resulting in a repetitive game of walk, stop, jump, shoot. On the positive side, Men in Black does sport some nice backgrounds and cool animated FMV intro sequences. But unless you're more into watching a game than actually playing it, stay clear of this Game Boy Color bore."

Jon Thompson of <a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>, who considered the Game Boy Color version "a complete waste of potential," stated, "Featuring only the most basic gameplay possible, MIB fails to conjure up any of the fun and excitement of <a href="Men%20in%20Black%20%281997%20film%29">the film</a> and show that inspired it, and ultimately boils down to a slow, boring experience". Thompson wrote that the levels "possess no gameplay elements that separate them from the other levels, and end up being simply window dressing for the same repetitive gameplay that grows old after level number one. Nothing changes over the course of the game. Even your weapons remain the same. From start to finish, the title is stale." Thompson concluded, "If it had come out in 1990, it might have been more acceptable."

Cameron Davis of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> criticized the Game Boy Color version for its graphics: "Aliens take the form of misshapen, barely recognizable sprites, hardly worthy of fear or even base acknowledgement. Backgrounds are drab and unimaginative. They repeat far too often [...]. As far as in-game graphics go, only the slick animation of the game's main character is worthy of redemption. MIB's graphical highlights come in the form of the animated intros and cutscenes that pepper this cart. The intro scene is particularly good, although it would have been nice if these visual niceties didn't come at the expense of actual gameplay."

Craig Harris of IGN reviewed the Game Boy Advance version and wrote, "This game has everything that makes a game bad -- horrible animation, limited controls, and gameplay design that's just downright unbearable when put into action."

Anne Clarke (theatre manager)

Anne Clarke née Remans (1806 - fl. 1847), was an Australian stage actor, singer and theatre manager. She was the first woman to manage an Australian theatre as the director of <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Hobart">Theatre Royal, Hobart</a> in 1840-1847. She had a significant role in the development of the early theatre in Tasmania and Australia. 

Life.
Anne Clarke arrived in Hobart in Tasmania in 1834, engaged to perform at the company of J. P. Deane at the Theatre Royal, Hobart, which was however then still under construction (it was not to open until 1837). 

She arrived in Tasmania just one year after the introduction of professional theater in Tasmania by the travelling company of <a href="Samuel%20Cameron">Samuel Cameron</a> and <a href="Cordelia%20Cameron">Cordelia Cameron</a> from England, and only two years after the first professional theatre performed in Australia (at <a href="Barnett%20Levey">Barnett Levey</a>'s Royal Hotel in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> in December 1832), making her one of the first professional actors active in Australia. 

She and another actress, <a href="Dinah%20Rudelhoff">Dinah Rudelhoff</a> (later director of the <a href="Geelong%20Theatre">Geelong Theatre</a> in 1845), was advertised to appear on stage in Hobart that summer, and were both referred to as experienced actors: "Annette—Miss Remens, Peggy—Miss Rudelhoff (from the Theatre Royal English Opera House [London], being their first appearance on this stage)." 

Anne Clarke married Michael Clarke. She performed in the theatre company of Samuel Cameron in 1834-36 and that of his rival <a href="John%20Meredith">John Meredith</a> in 1836-40. 
In April 1840, she became the manager of Theatre Royal. Though Cordelia Cameron managed the theatre in Launceston in 1836 and was as such the first woman theatre director in Australia "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>", Cameron only did so as the proxy of her spouse during his absence, and Clarke was thereby the first woman to have formally been theatre director in Australia. 

She recruited new actors from England in 1841–42, composed of <a href="Jerome%20Carandini">Jerome Carandini</a>, <a href="Theodosia%20Stirling">Theodosia Stirling</a>, <a href="John%20Howson%20%28actor%29">John Howson</a> and <a href="Frank%20Howson%20%28actor%29">Frank Howson</a>. By importing professional actors, she is regarded to have established acting as a respectable profession for both sexes in Australia. By advertising for respectable women interested in becoming actors, and giving them training, she introduced a new profession for women in the colony. The actors of her company somewhat became the pioneer Australian actor generation, many of whom moved on to careers in Melbourne and Sydney. 

She was highly recommended for her work, credited by the press with introducing 'a better class of performer and a superior style of management' and for giving theatre, which was then regarded as somewhat dubious, a good name. In July 1842, she applied Parliament for an official government license for her theatre, thereby separating it from other places of entertainment and making it a respected institution: in September that year, the "Act for regulating Places of Public Entertainment and for punishing
Persons Keeping disorderly Houses.", was passed. She is credited for having given the foundation for professional music life in the colony. The contemporary press credited her for her work developing the cultural life in the colony. She was regarded as an efficient businessperson and a progressive artist. 

Despite her good critic and artistic success, however, the colony was small and the theatre was still forced to struggle with its economy. Anne Clarke retired in 1847. She was by then separated from her spouse. Her later life is unknown. In the 1860s her theatre was still regarded as the role model for theatre life in the colony.

The Stone Sky is a 2017 <a href="science%20fantasy">science fantasy</a> novel by <a href="N.%20K.%20Jemisin">N. K.

Reception.
"The Stone Sky"s release was anticipated on several "best of" upcoming science fiction and fantasy lists, including the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" and "<a href="io9">io9</a>", and reception around its release was laudatory, with reviewers from <a href="Tor%20Books">Tor</a> and "<a href="The%20Verge">The Verge</a>" asserting that it was likely to win Jemisin a third consecutive <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Hugo Award for Best Novel</a>, behind "The Fifth Season" and "The Obelisk Gate".

In starred reviews, "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" summed up the novel as having "vivid characters, a tautly constructed plot, and outstanding worldbuilding" that came together in "an impressive and timely story of abused, grieving survivors fighting to fix themselves and save the remnants of their shattered home," and "<a href="Kirkus%20Reviews">Kirkus Reviews</a>" noting that "Jemisin continues to break the heart with her sensitive, cleareyed depictions of a beyond-dysfunctional family and the extraordinarily destructive force that is prejudice." "<a href="RT%20Book%20Reviews">RT Book Reviews</a>" gave the book five stars, higher than the first two books in the series. "<a href="Library%20Journal">Library Journal</a>" did not give "The Stone Sky" a star, but called it a "powerful conclusion" with a "fully developed world, detailed settings, and complex characters."

Tor's reviewer Niall Alexander, who was critical of "The Obelisk Gate", said that "The Stone Sky" was a "comprehensive confirmation of N. K. Jemisin as one of our very finest fantasists," and that as a whole, the series is "one of the great trilogies of our time." Barnes & Noble's Joel Cunningham agreed, asserting that it "reshapes the face of epic fantasy." "The Verge"s Andrew Liptak agreed, praising the book as "a triumphant achievement in fantasy literature." He concluded:

The Wilroy Iron Furnace, built in 1854, and one of the best preserved in <a href="Western%20Pennsylvania">Western Pennsylvania</a> is located just north of McConnell's Mill State Park on private land (Rose Point).

History.
McConnell's Mill State Park was formally dedicated as a <a href="State%20Park">State Park</a> in October 1957 and became a <a href="National%20Landmark">National Landmark</a> in May 1974. The striking scenery and deep gorge of the Slippery Rock Creek, flowing through the park, is attributed to the glaciation of the are several tens of thousands of years ago. The southern most extent of the <a href="Wisconsin%20Ice%20Sheet">Wisconsin Ice Sheet</a> dammed up Muddy Creek and Slippery Rock Creek, creating a lake system. As the ice melted, <a href="glacial%20Lake%20Arthur">glacial Lake Arthur</a> drained into Slippery Rock valley. As the ice dam receded, this spectacular gorge was cut to a depth of 122 meters (400 ft) through an otherwise rolling countryside, and large house-sized sandstone boulders slid part way down the gorge. The creation of this gorge reversed the natural drainage patterns changing the flow of the water from the <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20River">St. Lawrence River</a> to the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> watershed.

In 1868, Daniel Kennedy rebuilt his original mill, which was destroyed by fire. Thomas McConnell bought that mill in 1875 and improved it by replacing the <a href="water%20wheel">water wheel</a> with <a href="water%20turbine">water turbine</a>s and the <a href="grinding%20stone">grinding stone</a>s with <a href="rolling%20mill">rolling mill</a>s. The mill, one of the first rolling mills in the country, processed corn, oats and <a href="buckwheat">buckwheat</a> for local customers. The mill operated until 1928 when sagging profits and advanced technology caught up with it. The mill and the surrounding property was conveyed from the McConnell family to the <a href="Western%20Pennsylvania%20Conservancy">Western Pennsylvania Conservancy</a> and later to the Commonwealth with the wishes that they be preserved for future generations.

Marc Nix of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> criticized the characters for their lack of unique abilities, and wrote, "Collecting four pairs of sunglasses on each level, such as is the driving force in Men In Black 2, isn't enough reason for me to even get out of bed."

Nick Woods of <a href="AllGame">AllGame</a> called the sequel "one of the better side-scrolling action games on the Game Boy Color," and praised the character animations. However, Woods opined that the game was "much harder than it should be," and that, "It would have been nice if the characters had unique special moves; this would have distinguished them from one another. While the characters are somewhat disappointing, the gameplay is very entertaining."

Kai (artist)

Kai Guetta (also known as Kai and Kai Aspire), is an American artist.

Early life and education.
Born in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Kai Guetta goes by the pseudonym Kai, as well as Kai Aspire. After high school he studied at the l'<a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Beaux-Arts">École des Beaux-Arts</a> in Paris, and eventually moved back to LA.

Career.
Kai’s first piece to receive public attention was a street art mural of a <a href="Marlboro">Marlboro</a> cigarette pack with the term “Morons” replacing the brand’s name. During his teenage years, he continued to add graffiti pieces to surfaces in <a href="West%20Hollywood">West Hollywood</a>, typically with an anti-consumerism message. 

In 2012 he held his first solo exhibition at the Guetta Gallery in Los Angeles entitled "Now Royalty", which consisted of paintings representing hip hop artists in medieval royal outfits and motifs. Prior to the creation of the twenty-seven paintings, he trained in Italy and Holland in order to study the work of the <a href="Flemish%20Masters">Flemish Masters</a>. In all the collection took four years to create. In 2013 Kai debuted his solo exhibition "Lost Values" at the Lab Art Gallery in Los Angeles, in which he spoofs commercial imagery. In 2014 Kai took both of his exhibitions to Miami, in order to exhibit them at the Lulu Laboratorium. Pieces from the collection have since sold to public figures in the hip hop industry, including Lil Wayne and P. Diddy.

In 2013 Kai held a guerilla solo exhibition in the <a href="Louvre%20%E2%80%93%20Rivoli%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29">Louvre-Rivoli</a> station of the Paris metro. The exhibition featured sculptures of cigarette packets with ironic slogans similar to the pieces he first created in LA, and the Baroque-style oil paintings of hip hop icons from his "Now Royalty" collection. The exhibition was set-up before the station opened as it had not been officially authorized by the city. Each piece was arranged as if it were in a real gallery, with pedestals for the sculpture pieces and secured frames for the paintings. Some of the pieces parodied the work within the Louvre Museum specifically. 

In 2015 Kai began partnering with musical artist <a href="Chris%20Brown">Chris Brown</a>, under the pseudonym Konfused, to produce street art pieces under the label Konfuzed x Kai collection. The two spray-painted <a href="Porsche">Porsche</a> vehicles for Fine Art Auction Miami’s Urban Art Week, in addition to several other pieces. These pieces were then auctioned during the week. Seven pieces were created by the two in all over a three-day period. He has also partnered with NFL player <a href="Jarvis%20Landry">Jarvis Landry</a> for artwork in <a href="Wynwood%2C%20Miami">Wynwood, Miami</a>. 

At the 2016 Art Basel Miami, Kai exhibited the installation piece "Modern Relic", and later that year he exhibited cement plaques in the city of <a href="Le%20Touquet">Le Touquet</a>, France. In August 2017 Kai affixed eight cement-relief pieces on the exteriors of seven buildings in <a href="Aspen%2C%20Colorado">Aspen, Colorado</a>, causing the city to consider citing him for trespassing and destruction of property after his methods were seen as possibly damaging to the heritage value of the sites. 

In addition to gallery work, Kai has produced street art in several American cities, including Los Angeles and New York City.

Texans for Vaccine Choice is a <a href="political%20action%20committee">political action committee</a> in the U.S state of <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. Texans for Vaccine Choice advocates in favor of exemptions to vaccination requierments.

Background.
Texans for Vaccine Choice was founded in 2015 by a group of mothers who opposed legislation proposed by state representative <a href="Jason%20Villalba">Jason Villalba</a> (R-<a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>), which would have eliminated conscientious exemptions to vaccination requirements in the state of Texas. The bill was never voted on.

Activities.
Texans for Vaccine Choice opposed a bill introduced by Jason Villalba which would have eliminated conscientious exemptions to vaccination requirements in the state of Texas. Referring to this bill, Jackie Schlegel said “This is Texas. We believe in parental rights in Texas. Like, that is just a fundamental belief that most Texans have that parents make decisions for their children, not the state.” 

When he ran for re-election, Villalba faced opposition from Texans for Vaccine Choice as well as a primary challenger who ran a campaign largely based on the vaccine issue. Villalba won, but stated that he believed opposition from Texans for Vaccine Choice reduced his margin of victory, and said "I’m not interested in a suicide mission on this issue, I sense — and this is unfortunate — the only way a bill like this gets any traction is an even worse large-scale outbreak, between now and session. Short of that, I just don’t think there is going to be the appetite to do this bill.”

Texans for Vaccine Choice also provides online instructions on how to file vaccine exemptions.

Præstø Town Hall

Præstø Town Hall <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a>: Præstø Tådhus) is the former town hall of <a href="Pr%C3%A6st%C3%B8">Præstø</a>, now part of <a href="Vordingborg%20Municipality">Vordingborg Municipality</a>, in southeastern <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>. The building dates from 1824 but owes its current appearance to an adaption in 1858. A jailhouse wing projects from irs rear side.

History.
Præstø was incorporated as a <a href="market%20town">market town</a> in 1403. After being hit by flooding, major fires and siege by invading Swedish troops, it had become a rather poor town with around 400 residents when the merchant H. C. Grønvold established a facility for salting herring and started a largescale export of grain in the early 19th century.

Grønvold was also involved in the construction of the town hall in collaboration with the master carpenter Hans Andersen, der in collaboration with the merchant H.C. Grønvold. The local baliff Jacob Møller had previously sent in a rendering to Danske Kancelli and it had later been adjusted by <a href="Christian%20Frederik%20Hansen">Christian Frederik Hansen</a>. The town hall was expanded with a hailhouse wing in 1850 and the town hall's facade on the square was adapted in 1868.

The jailhouse was adapted for use as <a href="sloyd">sloyd</a> premises for the local school in the 1950s. The prison cells were used by the pupils for storing their works. The building was later used as storage space by Civilforsvaret and since the 1990s as storage space by the local theatre group.

In the <a href="1970%20Danish%20Municipal%20Reform">1970 Danish Municipal Reform</a>, the market town of Præstø was merged with the civil parishes of Allerslev, Beldringe, Bårse, Jungshoved and Skibinge to form Præstø Municipality. The town hall was decommissioned when Præstø was merged into <a href="Vordingborg%20Municipality">Vordingborg Municipality</a> in 2007. In 2015, Vordingborg Municipality decided to sell the building. The buyer was Jakob Helles, the owner of a local real estate company.

Architecture.
Møller's rendering was a copy of a rendering from 1803 made by the <a href="Viborg%2C%20Denmark">Viborg</a> architect Villags Sinding for a new town hall in <a href="Nyk%C3%B8bing%20Mors">Nykøbing Mors</a>. It is unclear how much of the original design has survived since the rendering has been lost and no images from before the 1868 renovation exist. The gabled wall dormer above the main entrance dates from the renovation, and it is believed that all the other decorations on the facade do so as well.

Today.
The building contains a restaurant on the ground floor.

Cultural references.
The building has been used as a location in the films "<a href="Den%20gamle%20m%C3%B8lle%20paa%20Mols">Den gamle mølle paa Mols</a>" (1953)m "<a href="Kristiane%20af%20Marstal">Kristiane af Marstal</a>" (1956), "<a href="Landsbyl%C3%A6gen">Landsbylægen</a>" (1961), "<a href="Aff%C3%A6ren%20i%20M%C3%B8lleby">Affæren i Mølleby</a>" (1976) and "<a href="Sl%C3%A6gten">Slægten</a>" (1978).

IFA W 50

The IFA W 50 is a medium-duty truck built by the <a href="East%20Germany">East German</a> <a href="Industrieverband%20Fahrzeugbau">IFA</a> conglomerate at their <a href="Industriewerke%20Ludwigsfelde">Ludwigsfelde plant</a> from 1965 until 1990. A total of about 572,000 were built in Ludwigsfelde, with an unknown additional number of special-use vehicles assembled at other plants. It was meant to be succeeded by the <a href="IFA%20L%2060">IFA L 60</a> but outlived it by several months. IFA ended all truck production on 17 December 1990, following the <a href="German%20reunification">reunification of Germany</a>.

History.
Beginning in the late fifties, the "Kraftfahrzeugwerk "Ernst Grube" Werdau" began work on a truck designed to replace the outmoded IFA W3 and S4000-1 models. Work progressed slowly, as the company had limited resources but had to respond to input from a number of political groups, including but not limited to the Moscow-based <a href="Comecon">Comecon</a>, the <a href="National%20People%27s%20Army">National People's Army</a>, the Berlin Planning Commission, and General Secretary <a href="Walter%20Ulbricht">Walter Ulbricht</a> himself. The truck was to have a cargo capacity of while being able to take a variety of bodies, all-wheel drive and three axles had to be an option, production had to be simple, and it had to use a standardized engine. Originally called the S4500, the name changed to W 45 in 1959 ("W" for "<a href="Werdau">Werdau</a>"). The first prototype (W 45LF) was operational in June 1962, with the four-wheel drive W 45LAF following shortly thereafter. It was expected to enter production in the last quarter of 1964, but then the requirements were increased to and the design was renamed the "W 50 - W stands for "Werdau" and 50 represents "five tonnes". However, on 21 December 1962 the "Ministerrat der DDR" decided that the "VEB Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde" (IWL) would build the W 50 instead of Werdau. One of the reasons for this decision was the cancellation of Dresden 152 airliner production in February 1961, which had caused the end of Pirna 014 jet engine production at Ludwigsfelde "(see above)".

Construction of a new truck factory at Ludwigsfelde began in April 1963. The site covered and the production hall complex was the largest in the DDR, with a floor area of about . The building extended in each direction, was high and the span between each of its steel columns was up to . IWL completed the first W 50 truck on 17 July 1965, several months before the end of "Troll" 1 scooter production that December.

W 50 truck production rose rapidly from 5775 in 1966 — the first full year of production — to 16,973 in 1969. However, serious quality problems arose with the W 50. IWL was working on the development of future truck models, but in August 1969 it had to stop such work to devote the entire capacity of its development and construction offices to tackle them. IWL's efforts to develop new trucks were divided again in 1971, when the most urgent needs were to improve the W 50 with a new cab, new 180 bhp engine and better chassis. After 1969 W 50 production growth was slower but set a new record almost every year, peaking at 29,004 in 1982 and again at 32,516 in 1986.

A high proportion of IWL trucks was exported. Between 1978 and 1987 over 80% of W 50 trucks built each year were sold abroad. The DDR needed export orders from countries outside the <a href="Comecon">Comecon</a> bloc, and for this IWL continued to develop variants of the W 50. As a result of the 1980–88 <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a>, both Iran and Iraq sought a simple, robust, inexpensive truck for their armies. The DDR was interested in supplying both sides in the war, so in March 1982 IWL began development of two derivative models, the IFA W 51 and W 52. The W 51 was meant to enter production in 1983, followed by the W 52 two years later. Part of the W 51 project was realised, but the W 52 was overtaken by an "SED Politbüro" decision in June 1983 to instruct IWL to concentrate on W 50 assembly and gradually displace it with its intended next-generation successor, the L 60. Total W 50 production at Ludwigsfelde from 1965 to 1990 was 571,831 vehicles, some sources state 571,789.

Design.
Built on a wheelbase, a plethora of different versions (about sixty different models were available directly, with other firms able to produce special versions) were developed over the years. Two wheelbases were available, . Right-hand-drive models were built for export and for special uses such as <a href="Street%20sweeper">street sweeping</a>. The W 50 was also popular with fire departments, especially as the LF16 TS8 pumper, and many examples are still in service in the former East Germany.

As required by the original brief, however, the engine was standardized: for the first two years, it was a revised version of the unit used in the IFA S4000-1: the <a href="Indirect%20injection">swirl chamber</a> diesel was called "4 KVD 14,5/12". In 1967 a <a href="Fuel%20injection%23Diesel">direct injection</a> version of this diesel four-cylinder replaced it. As with the earlier version, the "4VD 14,5/12-1 SRW" displaces but here it produces at 2300 rpm. The engine was built by VEB IFA Motorenwerk <a href="Nordhausen">Nordhausen</a> in the eponymous town. After 1973 the slightly modified "4 VD 14,5/12-2" replaced it. The new version was a better cold starter and remained operational in temperatures down to , as per the requirements of the <a href="National%20People%27s%20Army">NVA</a>.

Hungarian bus manufacturer <a href="Ikarus%20Bus">Ikarus</a> also manufactured a rear-engined <a href="midibus">midibus</a> called the 211, which used a variety of W 50 parts including the engine and axles. It was built from 1976 until 1990, when the demise of the W 50 meant that it had to be discontinued.

Replacement.
After the launch of the W 50, IWL undertook development work to increase engine power and reduce fuel consumption, reduce empty weight and increase payload, improve reliability and driver comfort and reduce production time. From 1967 IWL was planning a range of new trucks with sizes of three, five, six and 10 tonnes. Two prototypes were built: a three-tonne truck code-numbered 1013 followed by an 11-tonne one code-numbered 1118. After a protracted development, the 1118 became the <a href="IFA%20L%2060">IFA L 60</a>, which was originally intended to have a <a href="Volvo%20Trucks">Volvo</a> cab. In the end, the L 60 was given a cab based on that of the W 50, but able to be tilted forward for access to the engine. The L 60 was finally unveiled to the public at the Autumn <a href="Leipzig%20Trade%20Fair">Leipzig Trade Fair</a> in September 1986 and its series production began at Ludwigsfelde in June 1987, twenty years after development work had begun. As a result of slow sales of the L 60, IWL kept the W 50 in production alongside the L 60 until 1990.

John Bear (pirate)

John Philip Bear (fl 1684-1689, last name also Beare) was an English pirate active in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> who also served with the Spanish and French.

History.
Bear was granted a <a href="privateer">privateering</a> commission in September 1684 by Governor William Stapleton of <a href="Nevis">Nevis</a>, which he used to attack Spanish ships despite the commission only giving him leave to attack Indians and pirates. The Dutch Governor of <a href="Curacao">Curacao</a> in January 1685 ordered Bear tried for capturing a Spanish ship while the Dutch were at peace with Spain, which Bear avoided. But in April 1686 Bear led a raid on <a href="Tortola">Tortola</a>, capturing slaves and abusing Dutch and English prisoners. As a result the Dutch abandoned Tortola’s fledgling colony. That July Stapleton renewed Bear’s commission when Bear appeared in a different ship, claiming his former <a href="sloop">sloop</a> was leaking which forced them to transfer to the <a href="frigate">frigate</a> "James".

Stapleton confirmed Bear’s capture of the Spanish ship "La Soldad" in October; Bear claimed he’d been searching for the ship that assaulted Tortola when "La Soldad" attacked him. Captain St. Loe of the "HMS Dartmouth", the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> warship on station at Nevis, complained at length about Stapleton and Nevis’ Deputy Governor Russell (“a great favourer of privateers”), who went out of their way to enable and protect Bear’s piracies. In turn Russell complained of St. Loe: “His insolence to me, and his abuses to all Deputy-Governors and Councils of these Islands want a better pen than mine to describe.”

<a href="Hender%20Molesworth">Governor Molesworth</a> of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> wrote in August 1687 that Bear had turned pirate, openly attacking English ships. Bear had transferred his allegiance to Spain, marrying a supposed noblewoman in <a href="Havana">Havana</a> with much celebration. Molesworth was not fooled: “The nobleman's daughter is a strumpet that he used to carry with him in man's apparel, and is the daughter of a rum-punch-woman of Port Royal.” Bear apparently had kept his soon-to-be wife aboard his ship, dressed in men’s clothes. Under Spanish colors he sailed as a "guarda costa" privateer, patrolling from Havana and Puerto Rico.

Molesworth dispatched the "HMS Guernsey" “to demand the surrender of the pirate Bear, or failing that, to seek him out and destroy him,” though the Spanish would not give him up. Bear was still there by February of 1688, and may have moved to <a href="Vera%20Cruz">Vera Cruz</a> that May where he and others had captured at least six more English vessels. A rescued English prisoner claimed that after Bear swore allegiance to Spain his English crewmen refused to sail with him; Bear then took aboard a Spanish crew and threatened the Englishmen that they had to sail with him or face prison. The Spanish plundered Santo Domingo and <a href="Anguilla">Anguilla</a> in March of 1689, again led by Bear. After England allied with Spain thanks to <a href="King%20William%27s%20War">King William’s War</a>, Bear continued to hunt English ships, having sailed to <a href="Petit%20Goave">Petit Goave</a> to take a French commission.

1919 Blankenberge Police Station Bombing

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, Belgium and its people started to repair its war damage and mourn their losses. But before they could move on, a number of revenge actions shocked the country. Most of these crimes went unpunished as the perpetrators could easily get away in the chaos that gripped Belgium because the country was still trying to restore order. The attack on the <a href="Blankenberge">Blankenberge</a> police station however was one of the worst of these attacks and is still commemorated to this day in the city. Mainly because the 1919 Blankenberge police force only consisted of <a href="police%20commissioner">police commissioner</a> A. Naessens and 5 other officers.

Attack.
On the night of 7 May 1919, several police officers had finished their night patrol and were returning to the police station. When they arrived at the station, 2 officers found a linnen wrapped sack near the doorstep. Not being suspicious of it, the officers took the package in to see what was inside. Officer Cornelis Ponjaert opened the sack and found a bike chain as well as a metal box which was wrapped with thin ropes. When officer Ponjaert unwond the ropes a big explosion suddenly occured immideatly followed by another even bigger explosion. Everything in the waiting room was broken and threwn about and the remaining officers were threwn to the ground.

Officer Ponjaert, aged 56 (who opened the package) was fatally injured and died a half hour later. Two other officers were seriously injured as well one of them died of his injuries in the hospital and another officer was left slightly injured. Only one officer and the commissioner were left unharmed

Aftermath.
The attack was published in many news papers including "Het Brugsch Handelsblad" and caused an uproar in the city. An immidiate search for those responsible was held and 2 brothers were arrested and placed under suspicion of the crime. But they were released when the police concluded there was not enough evidence to grand a conviction. No further arrests or suspects were found. It was later concluded that this tragic act of terrorism was most likely a revenge act targeted against the police.

The 2 victims of the tragedy are buried alongside eachother in the graveyard of Blankenberge at the "Ereperk der plicht" where everybody who was killed while acting out their duty are buried.

According to the documentary, as of 2013, there were only five pet food manufacturers in the United States: <a href="Mars%20Corporation">Mars Corporation</a> (manufacturer of <a href="Royal%20Canin">Royal Canin</a>, <a href="Whiskas">Whiskas</a>, and <a href="Pedigree%20Petfoods">Pedigree</a>, among others), <a href="Nestl%C3%A9%20Purina%20PetCare">Nestlé Purina PetCare</a>, <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a>, <a href="Hill%27s%20Pet%20Nutrition">Hill's Pet Nutrition</a> (manufacturer of the <a href="Science%20Diet">Science Diet</a>), and <a href="The%20J.%20M.%20Smucker%20Company">The J. M. Smucker Company</a> (formerly <a href="Big%20Heart%20Pet%20Brands">Big Heart Pet Brands</a>, manufacturer of Meow Mix and Milk-Bone, among others). In 2014, however, Mars Corporation purchased Procter & Gamble's pet food brands (<a href="IAMS">IAMS</a>, <a href="Eukanuba">Eukanuba</a> and Natura) from the company, meaning that today there are only four manufacturers.

The documentary interviews several veterinarians who advocate raw feeding, such as Dr. Karen Shaw Becker and Dr. Barbara Royal, and it recounted previous pet food scares, such as the <a href="2007%20pet%20food%20recall">2007 pet food recalls</a> and the 2013 chicken jerky recall. 

The experts interviewed in the film link modern ailments found in pets, such as <a href="obesity">obesity</a> and <a href="allergies">allergies</a>, to diet, and claim that changing that diet would eliminate those problems. Among those personally criticized are Dr. Melody Raasch, who has advocated corn as a healthful dog food in the past for IAMS.

Other veterinarians disagreed, such as Dr. Annie Harvilicz, who in her interview said that she believed that <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and other <a href="pathogens">pathogens</a> in uncooked foods present a risk to pets. According to Dr. Becker, however, dogs frequently practice <a href="coprophagia">coprophagia</a> with no ill effects, and dogs are evolutionarily equipped to be able to process any pathogens in raw food.

The film also explains and criticizes the regulatory framework for pet food in the Untied States. Pet food and <a href="animal%20feed">animal feed</a> are not differentiated in the law, which means pets and <a href="livestock">livestock</a> are in many cases legally the same. If a pet dies due to poisonous food, American courts only return judgments which give plaintiffs minimal amounts of money in light of how much they care for and pay for their pets. In the United States, the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) regulates pet food labels, but the film criticizes the definitions used as misleading. For example, if a pet food has "dinner" on the label, it only need contain 25% meat; if the word "with" is used, as in "with beef", a pet food could be 97% grain or corn with only mandatory 3% beef. If the word "flavor" is used, as in "salmon flavor", the pet food need not contain any salmon at all, the only requirement is that there is enough of the ingredient "to be detected". Only foods specifically labeled with the words "cat food" and "dog food" need contain 95% or more meat.

Reception.
Reception to the film was mixed, and since it did not have a theater run, most major publications ignored it. Among users, the film has a 7.6 rating on IMDb as of August 2017. CBS's Chicago affiliate responded positively to the documentary, and included tips on making the switch to raw feeding and recipes from Dr. Barbara Royal. "Hammer To Nail" called the film a "powerful" documentary that "every pet owner needs to see".

Others, however, responded negatively. Lindsay Beaton, writing for "<a href="Pet%20Food%20Industry">Pet Food Industry</a>", an industry funded <a href="trade%20magazine">trade publication</a>, claimed that while labels "can be...confusing and overwhelming", "the industry knows this and has been discussing the issue at great length for some time now". She also claimed that the documentary did a poor job of "discussing any of the significant pet food safety changes that have come from those recalls in the decade since [the 2007 pet food recalls.]"

Writing in the veterinary <a href="trade%20magazine">trade magazine</a> "<a href="DVM360">DVM360</a>", Dr. Sarah J. Wooten criticized the documentary and offered a point-by-point rebuttal to the issues featured in the film. Dr. Wooten described the film as "misinformation designed to alarm you". She dismissed the idea that wolves and dogs should eat similar diets, citing a 2013 "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" study; and also defended feeding kibble to cats.

Avila, Tampa

Avila (; <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a>: "Abila" and "Obila") is an affluent neighborhood in <a href="North%20Tampa">North Tampa</a>, considered to be one of the most exclusive communities in <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>. The gated community lies within District 7 of the <a href="Tampa%20City%20Council">Tampa City Council</a>, occupied by star athletes, socialites, and professionals.

History.
Developer J. Robert “Bob” Sierra laid the groundwork for Avila in 1978. Surrounded by eight-foot walls, its name was inspired by the Spanish city of <a href="%C3%81vila%2C%20Spain">Ávila</a> that was itself protected by imposing walls. The vast majority of the current homes in Avila were built in the <a href="1980s">1980s</a>. The neighborhood was created with various dining options and its centerpiece, the Avila Golf and Country Club. Amenities include six <a href="tennis%20court">tennis courts</a>, a <a href="swimming%20pool">swimming pool</a> and <a href="health%20club">fitness center</a>, and an 18-hole <a href="golf%20course">course</a> redesigned by famed golfer <a href="Jack%20Nicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a> in 1988.

Former major league baseball player <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> holds an annual golf tournament here and <a href="Professional%20Golfers%20Association">PGA</a> pros are on staff for private golf lessons. Avila was constructed with two entrances, one on Lake Magdalene Boulevard and another on North Florida Avenue. The neighborhood is guarded 24 hours a day and patrolled by security guards who use radar guns to monitor the speeds of vehicles. The security committee was once led by Tony Muniz, chairman of the Tampa Sports Authority.

Geography.
Avila is located at 28.109035 north latitude, 82.460936 west longitude. Its boundaries are roughly <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Florida">Highway 41</a> to the west, Crenshaw Lake Road to the north, and Lake Magdalene Boulevard to the south. The community contains a dozen lakes, a conservation area, and <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="cypress">cypress</a>, and <a href="pine">pine</a> trees. The only street exceeding a mile in length is Guisando de Avila, measuring 1.17 miles in length.

Demographics.
As of 2010, Avila had a population of 2,626 with a median age of 40.6 years. Among the residents, 83.7% were born in America but only 39.3% were Florida natives. Nearly 83% of married-couple families contained two working parents and 13% of all households contained a single-mother.

Economic data.
The 900-acre community contains 395 residences where homes typically sell for $1.2 to $25 million. As of 2015, the median household income was $72,594. The average household contained 2.6 people with 42% of residences containing a minimum of nine rooms.

The neighborhood is zoned for the public institutions of Maniscalco Elementary School, Buchanan Middle School, and <a href="Gaither%20High%20School">Gaither High School</a>, but 47.6% of school-aged children attend private schools.

The Rivera murders.
On January 9, 2012, retired doctor Hector Rivera (76) and his wife Debra (55) were murdered at their Avila residence shortly before 8:00 p.m. Hector’s body was found in his driveway at 814 Taray De Avila while Debra’s body was located in a bathroom within the mansion. The following day, Debra’s personal assistant and driver Julian Ospina-Florez (31) was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder with theft noted as the motive. Ospina-Florez was found guilty on September 1, 2015, and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole three days later.

The Campbell massacre.
On the morning of May 7, 2014, Darrin Campbell (49) killed his wife Kimberly (51), his son Colin (18), and his daughter Megan (15), fatally shooting each in the head. The former executive at <a href="Pabst%20Brewing%20Company">Pabst Brewing Company</a> then attempted to cover up the crime by setting the $1 million mansion at 16223 Sierra De Avila on fire using gasoline and fireworks as an accelerant. He committed suicide as the house burned down, a home being leased by the Campbell family from former tennis professional <a href="James%20Blake%20%28tennis%29">James Blake</a>.

It tells the story of two students, roommates in a university dormitory, who try to procure an <a href="Abortion%20law">illegal abortion</a>.

After making its world premiere on the first day at the <a href="2007%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> in May 2007, it won three awards, including the "<a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a>".

It also won Best Film at Romania's national <a href="Gopo%20Awards">Gopo Awards</a>.

Despite competing for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</a>, "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days" was not shortlisted, creating controversy among critics and online film fans, as it had won the "Palme d'Or". The controversy caused an <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy</a> member to pledge nomination reform, though the category had often sparked criticism. Mungiu later said the omission and subsequent furor brought the picture substantial publicity, and that the experience taught him that critics and festival juries have differing tastes from the Academy.

Westerby Basset Hounds

The Westerby Basset Hounds is a working <a href="Basset%20Hound">basset</a> pack.

History.
The Westerby Basset Hounds descend from the Walhampton Basset Hounds, founded in 1889 by Christopher and Godfrey Heseltine at <a href="Lymington">Lymington</a> in the <a href="New%20Forest%20District">New Forrest</a>. In 1902, whilst Godfrey Heseltine was posted to India, the pack was sold to the <a href="Marquess%20Conyngham">Marquess Conyngham</a> of <a href="Slane%20Castle">Slane Castle</a> in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and were known as the Slane Bassets, returning to the New Forrest upon Godrey’s return in 1910. Between 1915 and 1920, whilst Godfrey Heseltine served in the Great War and subsequently again in India, the pack was loaned to the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Dockyard%20Rosyth">Royal Naval Dockyard Rosyth</a> and were known as the Rosyth Bassets, again returning to Godfrey who moved the pack to <a href="Lutterworth">Lutterworth</a> in <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a>, where the pack remained until his death in 1931.

In 1932 the rump of the pack was purchased by Dr Eric Morrison who renamed the pack the Westerby Basset Hounds after the village of <a href="Smeeton%20Westerby">Smeeton Westerby</a>. After World War II, due to the increased cultivation of <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> within the hunt’s county, a more active hound than a traditional basset was sought. After unsuccessful attempts at outcrosses with <a href="Welsh%20Hound">Welsh Hound</a>s and the <a href="Beagle">Beagle</a>s, the now Colonel Morrison (after his World War II service) very successfully incorporated stud book <a href="Harrier%20%28dog%29">Harrier</a> blood into the pack, resulting in hounds with the same voice and nose, but less bone, shorter backs and shorter ears. The resulting hounds were the first of what was to be called the "English Basset", a type of dog now used by a number of English Basset hound packs. More recently, further infusions with West Country Harriers, Beagles and pure Bassets have been incorporated into the type.

Hunt country.
The Westerby Basset Hound’s country extends from <a href="Melton%20Mowbray">Melton Mowbray</a> in the north to <a href="Daventry">Daventry</a> in the south and <a href="Nuneaton">Nuneaton</a> in the west to <a href="Uppingham">Uppingham</a> in the east.

Les Djinns (Franck)

Les <a href="Djinn">Djinn</a>s <a href="Opus%20number">FWV</a> 45 is a <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a> for piano and orchestra by <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a>. 

Composition.
The pianist <a href="Caroline%20Montigny-R%C3%A9maury">Caroline Montigny-Rémaury</a> had asked for a short piano and orchestra piece, but she never played the work that Franck composed in the summer of 1884. It was premiered 15 March 1885 by <a href="Louis%20Di%C3%A9mer">Louis Diémer</a> as the pianist, in a concert at the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20de%20Musique">Société Nationale de Musique</a>. 

The work is inspired by the <a href="Les%20Djinns%20%28poem%29">eponymous poem</a> in "<a href="Les%20Orientales">Les Orientales</a>" by <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>. The latter often inspired Franck (melodies, and his first symphonic poem "<a href="Ce%20qu%27on%20entend%20sur%20la%20montagne">Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne</a>", composed in 1847-1848, at the same time as the <a href="Ce%20qu%27on%20entend%20sur%20la%20montagne">work</a> by <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> from the same inspiration).

Franck takes up the idea of the mysterious and supernatural forces tearing the nocturnal sky through their passage, and especially the singular rhythm of Hugo's poem, rising from calm into a sonorous storm, before falling back into the silence of the night. The piano part is very virtuosic, and Franck so liked Diémer's interpretation of this difficult score that he wrote his "<a href="Symphonic%20Variations%20%28Franck%29">Variations symphoniques</a>" for Diémer, also for piano and orchestra, marking Franck's renewed interest in this instrument.

St. John de Britto Institute

St. John de Britto Institute ("Instituto São João de Brito" – ISIB) was opened by the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> in 2016 to train secondary school teachers for the country. 

History.
Early efforts.

They left in 1910 when all religious were expelled from Portuguese colonies, and were absent for some decades. Upon returning they ran two minor seminaries, St. <a href="Francis%20Xavier">Francis Xavier</a> in <a href="Dare">Dare</a> and <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20F%C3%A1tima">Our Lady of Fátima</a> in until 2000 when priests of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> Diocese of <a href="Dili">Dili</a> took these over. They also ran <a href="St.%20Joseph%27s%20High%20School">St. Joseph's High School</a> for the Diocese of Dili from 1993 until 2011, when the diocese resumed control of it. Jesuits stood by the people in their independence struggle and two Jesuits were killed in September 1999; they are seen as martyrs, Frs. Tarcisius Dewanto and Karl Albrecht.

Founding of de Britto.
After 2011 the Jesuits turned their attention to opening two of their own schools on a common campus near Kasait, not far from Dili: <a href="St.%20Ignatius%20of%20Loyola%20College%2C%20East%20Timor">Colégio Santo Inácio de Loiolá</a> and teacher education Instituto <a href="St.%20John%20de%20Britto">São João de Brito</a>. In 2017 ISIB operated out of classrooms of Loyola in Kasait as construction began there in its own facility. The original intake of ISIB was 25 students who would assist at <a href="St.%20Ignatius%20of%20Loyola%20College%2C%20East%20Timor">Loyola College</a> on the grounds in their first two years and in their third and fourth years would be supervised while teaching at various secondary schools throughout the country. It first offered majors in English and Religious Education but intends to extend offerings to mathematics, Portuguese, and Timorese History and Culture.

Collaborative effort.
The school integrates with other Jesuit works in the new country: a mission parish with secondary school and health care program in <a href="Railaco%20Administrative%20Post">Railaco</a>, a public service Audiovisual Production House, and Jesuit Social Service Timor-Leste which fosters volunteerism, strengthens communities, and facilitates networking.

Southeast Asian Regional Center for Higher Education and Development

RIHED is the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) Centre specialising in regional higher education development and hosted by the Ministry of Education (Thailand).

Mission<br>
SEAMEO RIHED’s mission is to foster efficiency, effectiveness, and harmonisation of higher education in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> through system research, empowerment, collaboration and development of mechanisms to facilitate sharing in higher education.

Vision<br>
SEAMEO RIHED’s vision is to be a dynamic, strategic, and internationally recognised regional centre for promoting understanding, collaboration, and synergy in higher education for regional development.

History.
The Regional Institute of Higher Education and Development (RIHED) was conceived jointly by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Association of Universities (IAU) in collaboration with the Ford Foundation in 1959. In July 1970, RIHED was officially founded in Singapore with 7 Member States including Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Following a decision reached by the RIHED Governing Board in 1985 to re-establish the institute under the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) through coordinated efforts with the SEAMEO Secretariat, approval was obtained by the Thai Government and located on the fifth-floor of the Office of the Higher Education Commission in Bangkok, Thailand. 
RIHED plays a crucial role in the capability building of SEAMEO member countries in the field of higher education. It responds to a variety of needs with activities on policy, planning, administration and management of higher education.

Organisation.
SEAMEO RIHED operates within the rapidly changing environment of the Southeast Asian higher education systems. This landscape is chiefly characterised by diversity, due to the different historical, structural and educational developments in countries of the region. Global forces including globalization, massification, diversification, and marketization compound this variety. Many countries have recently restructured their higher education systems, in an effort to deal with the increasingly multifaceted activities undertaken by higher education institutions. This has frequently resulted in increasing autonomy of higher education institutions, to allow them to face the increasing range of demands and accelerated pace of intra‐ and international competition.

Higher education development is a priority in the region as a primary means of promoting Asian socioeconomic development. The harmonisation of higher education is also in line with the ASEAN objective of ‘One ASEAN at the Heart of Dynamic Asia’. SEAMEO RIHED strongly advocates the Harmonisation of Higher Education in Southeast Asia, as a means of meeting the vision of Southeast Asian leaders.

<doc id="54948026" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54948026" title="Chocolate gateau">
Chocolate gateau

Chocolate Gateau (British) /pronunciation ["ga-toh, gah-; French gah-toh"]/, Gateau au chocolat (French) meaning- A rich cake, typically one containing layers of cream or fruit "‘a chocolate gateau’" Origin- Mid 19th century: from French gâteau ‘cake’. 

French gâteaux can have several layers, one or more of which are made up of mousse, ganache or fruit filling, supported by thin layers of sponge cake. Thus for a gâteau cake is not the centerpiece, it’s more of a structural element. Another important distinguishing factor is that gâteaux are usually made with a lot of fresh fruit, which obviously wilts rather easily. Thus a gâteau is typically intended to be eaten the same day it’s made.Typically chocolate gateau is enriched with melted chocolate and also a little brandy to make it rich. 

History.
One of the first chocolate cakes in Europe was baked sometime around the 17th century, when bakers began adding cacao powder, newly imported from the Americas, to their traditional cake recipes.

During the 19th century, pastry chefs, notably in France and Austria, concocted sophisticated chocolate desserts to be enjoyed by the privileged elites.

For everyone else, chocolate in all its forms remained a rare treat, reserved for special occasions. It was not until the 20th century, as cacao prices became more affordable, that chocolate cake reached the masses. Today, it is undoubtedly one of the most popular desserts of all time!

There are endless varieties of chocolate cake, from luscious gâteau fondant au chocolat, Sachertorte or Black Forest cake, to rich brownies and even flourless chocolate cake.

This basic recipe for gâteau au chocolat (chocolate cake) is adapted from the classic French cookbook "Je sais cuisiner" (French edition), by Ginette Mathiot (Albin Michel), also available in English as I Know How to Cook.

Genre-Specific Xperience

Genre-Specific Xperience is a project by <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> musician <a href="Fatima%20Al%20Qadiri">Fatima Al Qadiri</a> that serves as her second <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> in her discography. Its intention is to reinterpret five musical genres through audio and visuals: <a href="Juke%20house">juke</a>, <a href="hip%20hop">hip hop</a>, <a href="dubstep">dubstep</a>, electronic <a href="tropicalia">tropicalia</a>, and what the press release labeled as "‘90s <a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian</a> <a href="trance%20music">trance</a>." The main idea of the project regards what would happen if the "limitations" of a genre were bypassed or altered. The visuals for the tracks were produced by <a href="Tabor%20Robak">Tabor Robak</a>, <a href="Sophia%20Al-Maria">Sophia Al-Maria</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Trecartin">Ryan Trecartin</a>, Rhett LaRue, Kamau Patton, and production company Thunder Horse. The music videos premiered at <a href="New%20Museum">New Museum</a> on 21 October 2011, and the <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> itself was released by UNO Records on 25 October to favorable reviews from professional <a href="music%20journalist">music journalist</a>s. A remix record titled "GSX Remixes" was released in May 2012 and features re-edits of tracks from "Genre-Specific Xperience" by acts such as <a href="Ikonika">Ikonika</a> and <a href="DJ%20Rashad">DJ Rashad</a>.

Concept and composition.
The overall project of "Genre-Specific Xperience" intends to sonically and visually reinterpret five genres: <a href="juke%20house">juke house</a> ("Corpcore"), <a href="hip%20hop">hip hop</a> ("Hip Hop Spa"), <a href="dubstep">dubstep</a> ("How Can I Resist U"), electronic <a href="tropicalia">tropicalia</a> (“D-Medley”), and what the press release labeled as "‘90s <a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian</a> <a href="trance%20music">trance</a>" (“Vatican Vibes”). Critic Shawn Reynaldo also noticed elements of 1990s <a href="new%20age%20music">new age music</a> on the record. The tracks were produced with a <a href="MIDI%20controller">MIDI controller</a> and <a href="virtual%20instrument">virtual instrument</a>s. In categorizing the overall style of the music, Carrie Battan of "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" explained that it "harnesses the eerie mysticism of "<a href="Warn-U">WARN-U</a>" [...] but channels it into a percussive, neo-global club sound driven by an unexpectedly sinister synthetic steel drum."

Qadiri viewed a genre as a set of certain "limitations" that make up music of a specific sound or style. Thus, she made the songs and visuals that commentated on what would happen if those limits were bypassed or changed. Kathleen Flood of "<a href="The%20Creators%20Project">The Creators Project</a>" stated that the music and visuals of "Genre-Specific Xperience" present the internet "as a multi-dimensional venue, underscoring the significance of working with found footage and how the act of collaborating and translating a theme or emotion through multiple mediums can resonate much deeper than streaming a <a href="Soundcloud">Soundcloud</a> track."

Tracks and music videos.
"Genre-Specific Xperience" opens with "Hip Hop Spa," the easiest track for Qadiri to create due to hip hop's “broad visual language.” "Hip Hop Spa" includes chanting, steel drums, and drum machines. As Benns summarized Kamau Patton's video for the song, it "depicts typical hip-hop video elements—money, women, drugs—and films them in a disaffected, distorted and rough manner." Both Patton and Qadiri also took into consideration the similarities between being in "<a href="solitary%20confinement">solitary confinement</a> in a spa" and being isolated from other humans in prison when making the track and visuals. "D-Medley" continues the structure of "Hip Hop Spa," maintaing the chants, steel drum sounds, and electronic drums and adding trance-style synthesizers to it. "D-Medley"'s video was produced by Thunder Horse and, as Flood wrote, "explores the fantasy realm through culled YouTube footage of bodacious babes."

"How Can I Resist U" and "Corpcore" are "Genre-Specific Xperience"'<nowiki>'</nowiki>s more dancefloor-suitable tracks. "How Can I Resist U" consists of what Reynaldo described as "stuttering snares, tweaked vocal samples, and thick, lurching bass tones." The track's video was directed by <a href="Sophia%20Al-Maria">Sophia Al-Maria</a> and was described by Qadiri as a "love letter to London, dubstep and being a Gulf Arab" The video is a collection of footage downloaded from <a href="Youtube">Youtube</a> of females dancing at mens-only parties in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. As Qadiri explained, "The video is about temptation and the relationship between the Gulf and London, how London represents a kind of forbidden fruits playground for Gulf Arabs for several decades now."

The fourth track on the EP is "Vatican Vibes." It's driven by a two-second loop of a Gregorian chant, and a journalist for "<a href="The%20National%20%28Abu%20Dhabi%29">The National</a>" wrote that it "traps the listener inside a video game-cum-hall of mirrors, a prism of sounds and melodies wherein beats and synth voices bounce and refract off each other." <a href="Tabor%20Robak">Tabor Robak</a> was responsible for directing the visuals for "Vatican Vibes," consisting of a compilation of <a href="stock%20footage">stock footage</a> and <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> meant to visualize the genre of "Gregorian trance." She first listen to music of the style by artists such as <a href="Enigma%20%28musical%20project%29">Enigma</a> at the age of nine while riding from Kuwait to <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a> and enjoyed it for its "cinematic and over-the-top" elements. The video is also intended represent Catholicism as a video game with rules and strategies. As Qadiri explained, "I've always viewed organised religion as a means of consolidating power, and the Vatican is [home to] one of the oldest, most organised religions in the world. The incredible amount of mysticism behind it was deconstructed through the use of the video game aesthetic, which is very basic, very obvious, totally lacking in mystery - but still feeds into this notion of power and conspiracy." As "The National" stated, "the video and music function as an uncloaking of theosophy, wittily and satirically revealing something rather childish about the demands of religious authority."

"Genre-Specific Xperience" closes with "Corpcore." Its visuals were produced by <a href="Ryan%20Trecartin">Ryan Trecartin</a> and Rhett LaRue in collaboration with TELFAR for his installation titled "FORmale", which took place at the White Box Gallery in New York from 10 September to 12 September 2010. The visuals mix together real-life footage of offices, clubbing and gymnasiums with 3D graphics. This is intended to show a connection between dancing at a club and exercising in that they involve someone pushing his limits. Given that the track is a reinterpretation of juke house, it also shows similarities between Chicago's corporate culture and the city's underground producers that make juke. As Qadiri explained, both workers and house producers "have this stamina and determination, almost like the nine-to-five ethic. But operating at different hours."

Release and promotion.
The video for "Vatican Vibes" was first released on 13 October 2011. An official release party for "Genre-Specific Xperience" took place at the <a href="New%20Museum">New Museum</a> on 21 October 2011. In addition to the tracks being played, all of the music videos also premiered at the event. UNO Records officially released the extended play on 25 October 2011.

Critical reception.
As Reynaldo wrote about the EP for "<a href="XLR8R">XLR8R</a>", "it's rare than an artist can take a disparate list of genre influences—all of them heavily namechecked in various tastemaking circles—and distill them into anything resembling a cohesive, let alone quality, statement, but that's exactly what Al Qadiri has done." He praised it for being "surprisingly welcoming, as there is nothing particularly weird or difficult about "Genre-Specific Xperience", even if Al Qadiri's recipe for constructing it was rather complex." He also spotlighted the record's "universal sound." A writer for "<a href="Now%20%28newspaper%29">Now</a>" called the EP's material "blissful, intriguing," "evocative and sometimes humorous." Battan called the EP "more compelling" than Qadiri's previous release "Warn-U" (2011), writing that it "can lean toward gimmickry, but Al Qadiri stays on the right side of that line throughout most of the EP's 23 minutes."

"GSX Remixes".
Not long after the release of "Genre-Specific Xperience", Qadiri conceived the idea of doing an album of remixes of tracks from the EP. A remix album titled "GSX Remixes" was issued by UNO on 22 May 2012 and consists of seven re-edits of tracks from the original record.

Girl Unit contributed a remix of "How Can I Resist U," which, as the producer explained, added "super saturated sounds" and brought the "swirling synth line from the original down into a stormy, tense affair which switches up to this serene moment in which the signature vocals slip in, and then switch back with this constant hard/soft dynamic." Ezra Rubin, known by his stage name as Kingdom, made a "three chapter remix" of Corpcore. As he explained, "there’s an industrial funk build up that brings you to the door of the club, a really hyperactive bass drop area, then the floor to the club opens and you fall into the bump and grind blacklight room below." Kingdom wanted to remix "Corpcore" because he enjoyed the original track's clap programming. Nguzunguzu produced a re-edit of "Hip Hop Spa" which made the track's minimal percussions much more heavy-sounding.

Dubbel Dutch made a remix of "Vatican Vibes" that consists of sounds that reference other genres; the <a href="E-mu%20Proteus">E-mu Proteus</a> flutes reference <a href="grime%20music">grime music</a>, the snare sounds are borrowed from the soundtrack for the film "<a href="Drumline%20%28film%29">Drumline</a>" (2002), and the "cut-time percussion" that plays during the breakdowns and end of the remix use <a href="zouk">zouk</a>-and-tarracha-style rhythms. He originally planned for his remix to be "atmospheric." However, he quickly changed his initial plan: "I found it really challenging to incorporate the lead melodies from Vatican Vibes mainly because the licks that Fatima wrote were so strong that I didn’t want to fall into the trap of making a remix that sounded more like a bad edit of the original – so instead I tried to incorporate pieces of the melody into a new variation on the theme."

Electromagnetic vortex intensifier with ferromagnetic particles

Electromagnetic vortex intensifier with ferromagnetic particles (vortex layer devise, electromagnetic mill) consists of an operating chamber (pipeline) with a diameter of 60–330 mm, located inside an inductor with a <a href="Rotating%20magnetic%20field">rotating electromagnetic field</a>. The operating chamber contains cylindrical <a href="Ferromagnetism">ferromagnetic</a> particles 0.5–5 mm in diameter and 5–60 mm in length, ranging from tens to several thousand pieces (0.05–20 kg), depending on the dimensions of the operating chamber of the intensifier.

History of electromagnetic vortex intensification.
Electromagnetic devices with a vortex layer were proposed in 1967 by D.D. Logvinenko and O.P. Shelyakov. The monograph "Intensification of technological processes on devices with a vortex layer", written by these authors, showed the effective use of these devices in:
Following this research, these intensifiers found their application in many researches and developments.

Physical processes in electromagnetic vortex intensifiers.
Intensification of technological processes and <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a>s is achieved due to intensive <a href="Mixing%20%28physics%29">mixing</a> and dispersion, acoustic and electromagnetic treatment, high local pressure and <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of processed components. Electromagnetic devices with a vortex layer with ferromagnetic elements accelerate the reactions 1.5-2 times; reduce the consumption of reagents and electricity by 20%. The grinding effect is achieved by the motion of ferromagnetic particles and their free collision with each other, and a constrained collision between the particles and a body. The degree of grinding is 0.5 μm (with an initial size of 20 mm).
At present, the electromagnetic devices with a vortex layer with ferromagnetic elements actually exist (D.D. Logvinenko himself designed and produced more than 2000 pieces), their principle is also implemented in some technological lines.

Industrial application of electromagnetic vortex intensifiers.
Examples of industrial applications of these devices for intensifying processes are:
Electromagnetic vortex intensifier grinds and regrinds coal, alumina-containing slag, quartz sand, technical diamonds, cellulose, chalk, wood flour, fluoroplastics, etc.
Also, it can be used for decontamination of agricultural animal waste.

<doc id="54948569" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54948569" title="Lytham Pier">
Lytham Pier

Lytham Pier is a former pier in the seaside town of <a href="Lytham">Lytham</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, England. Having opened in 1865 as both a <a href="pleasure%20pier">pleasure pier</a> and a <a href="Pier%23Working_piers">working pier</a> despite reservations from local residents, the pier underwent several renovations during the 1890s-1900s prior to being badly damaged by a storm in 1903, involving two barges splitting the pier into two. A considerably worse disaster occured in 1928, when a fire caused extensive damage to the pavilion which was not rebuilt, although the pier did reopen several months later. Following a period of decline and closure to the public shortly before the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the pier was ultimately demolished in 1960, despite thousands of signatures from local residents opposed to the demolition.

Plans to rebuild the pier were discussed by local counsillors in 2007, with the "Lytham St Annes Civic Society" opposed to any such plan and no further progress has been made since that initial proposal.

History.
Planning.
Provision for a pier to be constructed for pleasure and as a boat landing deck were first discussed during the early 1860s, which led to the "Lytham Pier Company" being formed in 1861. Plans for the pier included visitor waiting rooms at the pier head, with ornamental gates at the entrance similar to those at Brighton's <a href="West%20Pier">West Pier</a>. The pier's construction began in 1864, with the screwing in of the first iron pier a pre-planned event to ensure a suitably large number of visitors would be present to witness the occasion. The pier did not have unanimous local support, as some residents believed Lytham did not have a sufficient number of regular visitors to make a pier financially viable, whilst some were of the belief that a high tide may too easily destroy the pier.

Construction.
Despite some reservations, construction completed a year later, opening <a href="Easter">Easter</a> Monday on 17th April 1865 by Lady Eleanor Clifton, at a cost of £5890 (). The pier was entirely constructed using 300 tons of iron, supported by 126 iron columns each separated by and screwed into the solid clay base beneath the beach. A shelter was erected on the pier head's dock, for passengers embarking or landing from <a href="Paddle%20steamer">steam vessels</a>. The pier was capable of accommodating up to 5000 people, of which 1000 could be seated.

Operation.
The pier had a small renovation in 1892 with the addition of a floral hall <a href="pavilion">pavilion</a> half way along the desk, costing £12,000 (). A further reconstruction followed in 1901-1092 to enlarge the pavilion, including raising the roof to accommodate taller <a href="Theatrical%20scenery">stage scenery</a> and enlargement of the theatre stage; other improvements included the erection of an additional dressing room, refreshment rooms and an upper tea-room added to the pavilion's balcony. The pier suffered significant damage from two separate incidents in 1903, with the first occuring on 27 February when two shelters were blown into the ocean during a storm. Worse damage occured later in the year on 6 October, when two <a href="barge">barge</a>s driven by a gale-force winds collided with the pier, with a man on board each barge and each unable to prevent the collision of their respective boats; one barge caused significant damage to the central pier structure whilst the other got caught amongst the piers supporting the pavilion. Despite the damage, claims were made against "Preston Corporation" who owned the barges and after repairs were untaken, the pier reopened at Easter 1904.

Decline.
By 1920, the pier was struggling to remain financially viable with JH Harrison, the manager of 32 years, stepping down the following year. In January 1928, a fire destroyed the pavilion, leaving behind a steelwork shell that was not rebuilt, with the cause remaining unknown and the damage, covered by insurance, amounting to thousands of pounds. The fire did not take any fatalities, given the caretaker who resided on-site had only just left his residence to sound the alarm before it was engulfed by the flames. Despite a proposal several months after the fire to build a new pavilion at the pier's shore end, from a design prepared by St Anne's architect Arnold England, the design was not followed through into construction and the pier reopened on 24 May 1928 without a pavilion. The next ten years saw a plan by then-owners "Lytham Pier & Amusements Ltd" looking to convert the pier into the shape of a ship, but the plans did not come to fruition and the entire pier ultimately closed in 1938 as popularity dwindled, subsequently deteriorating throughout the mid-20th century. Whilst the kiosks at the pier's entrance remained in use, the council decided in 1959 it would be demolished, as they were unwilling to fund the £5000 () required for restoration. The pier was ultimately demolished in March 1960 at a cost of £7320 (), including £4000 () in compensation to then-owner Harry Kaniya, despite a petition opposed to the plan from local residents totalling nearly 2600 signatures.

Reconstruction proposals.
It was reported in May 2007 that local <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> councillors were investigating the possibility of securing a grant to reconstruct the pier. Councillor Richard Fulford-Brown believes that if the circumstances regarding the pier's demolition were an issue today, it would be considerably more difficult to follow through with it and takes the view that a pier visitor attraction offers something interesting for residents and visitors alike. A similiar suggestion had previously been made by a local architect, who proposed an <a href="eco-friendly">eco-friendly</a> boardwork complete with a viewing station. As of 2007, "Lytham St Annes Civic Society" were opposed to any reconstruction proposal on the grounds that the town centre should be protected, especially as there are already piers in nearby <a href="St%20Anne%27s%20Pier">St Annes-on-the-Sea</a> and Blackpool (<a href="North%20Pier%2C%20Blackpool">North</a> and <a href="Central%20Pier%2C%20Blackpool">Central</a>) respectively.

S 9 (Abydos)

S 9 (also Abydos-south S9) is the modern name given to a monumental <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ian tomb complex at <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a> in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. The tomb is most likely royal and dates to the mid-<a href="Thirteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">13th Dynasty</a>. Finds from the area of the tomb indicate that S9 suffered deliberate, extensive, state-sanctioned stone and grave robbing during the <a href="Second%20Intermediate%20Period">Second Intermediate Period</a>, only a few decades after its construction, as well as during the later <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman</a> and <a href="Coptic%20period">Coptic period</a>s. Although no direct evidence was found to determine the tomb owner, strong indirect evidence suggest that the neighbouring and slightly smaller tomb S10 belongs to pharaoh <a href="Sobekhotep%20IV">Sobekhotep IV</a> (fl. c. 1725 BC). Consequently, S9 has been tentatively attributed by the Egyptologist <a href="Josef%20W.%20Wegner">Josef W. Wegner</a> to Sobekhotep IV's predecessor and brother, <a href="Neferhotep%20I">Neferhotep I</a> (fl. c. 1735 BC).
According to Wegner, the tomb might originally have been capped by a pyramid.

Description.
Location.
Tomb S9 is part of a royal necropolis dating back to the late <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> – <a href="Second%20Intermediate%20Period">Second Intermediate Period</a>, which is located immediately northeast of the causeway leading to the much bigger funerary complex of <a href="Senusret%20III">Senusret III</a> of the <a href="12th%20Dynasty">12th Dynasty</a>, close to the ancient town of <a href="Wah-Sut">Wah-Sut</a> and at the foot of the so-called "Mountain of <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a>", a natural hill in the form of a pyramid. It was first summarily explored by <a href="%C3%89mile%20Am%C3%A9lineau">Émile Amélineau</a> and subsequently excavated by Ayrton, Weigall and Petrie in 1901—1902. The tomb was covered in sand and proved to have been heavily disturbed, for example, the stone roof of the subterranean chambers had been plundered.

Layout.
Tomb S9 comprises the remains of a mudbrick inner enclosure wall, over in size, as well as a section of an outer whitewashed wavy wall in front of the northern side. There, lay a small rectangular chapel of which only one course of bricks survives, and beyond the entrance to the substructures. The overall layout of the tomb complex is very similar to that of the <a href="Southern%20Mazghuna%20pyramid">Southern Mazghuna pyramid</a>.

The substructures were dug into the hard sand, some below the surface, and lined with smooth limestone blocks. A passage leads to a <a href="Quartzite">quartzite</a> portcullis, intended to stop tomb robbers from reaching the burial chamber. Beyond the portcullis was a stone-lined chamber in dimensions, the floor of which hid a further passage blocked by two portcullises, one of limestone and another of quartzite. Beyond, lies the burial chamber housing a massive sarcophagus built from three blocks of quartzite sandstone, roughly hewn on the outside, but well polished on the inside. The southern end of the burial chamber also had a recess meant to hold grave goods. Overall, the plan of the substructures of tomb S9 is similar to those found in the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Khendjer">Pyramid of Khendjer</a>. Small fragments of burned wood were uncovered there during the 1901 excavations suggest that the wooden coffin of the king was destroyed. Since then, burned bandages, small pieces of inscribed, gilded plaster from the king's mummy mask, and pieces of wood and faience inlay, stone jars, beads, and bone needles were unearthed in the substructures as well as in the rubbles of the enclosure wall.

Type.
No traces of the superstructures once capping tomb S9 have survived and determining its type—mastaba or pyramid—remains difficult. Ayrton, Weigall and Petrie believed S9 was a mastaba, because of the enclosing wall which they thought would have held the sand packed on top of the substructures. However, the royal nature of S9 and S10 as well as their architectural similarities to pyramids of the late Middle Kingdom in the area of <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a> have led Wegner to suggest S9 might have been a pyramid too. In spite of these arguments, the Egyptologist <a href="Aidan%20Dodson">Aidan Dodson</a> asserts that it is still unclear whether S9 was a mastaba or a pyramid.

Attribution.
Excavations in 2003 and in 2014 made it very likely that this structure as well as the neighbouring one S10 were originally royal tombs. At the latter date, during excavations directed by <a href="Josef%20W.%20Wegner">Josef W. Wegner</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, a fragment of a funerary tomb stela bearing a relief naming a king Sobek[hotep] was found inside the enclosure of tomb S10, on the eastern side of the complex, where a funerary temple might once have existed. In addition, fragments of wooden coffin inscribed for the same Sobekhotep were uncovered in later Second Intermediate Period tombs adjacent to S10. These fragments indicate a late Middle Kingdom date for the construction of S10.
While in early press reports, published just after these discoveries, king <a href="Sobekhotep%20I">Sobekhotep I</a> was named as the possible owner of the tomb, further analyses now indicate that S10 might belong to <a href="Sobekhotep%20IV">Sobekhotep IV</a> instead. 

Indeed, not only do the fragments of wooden coffin uncovered indicate a late Middle Kingdom date for the construction of S10, but its size means that its owner would have had to reign for long enough to complete it. This only leaves <a href="Sobekhotep%20III">Sobekhotep III</a>, IV, and <a href="Sobekhotep%20VI">VI</a> as possibilities, with Sobekhotep IV being the most likely as he enjoyed the longest reign of these three kings. In addition, Sobekhotep IV is the only one of these kings for whom it is known with certainty that he undertook other works in Abydos. 
As a corollary, tomb S9 likely belongs to Sobekhotep IV's predecessor and brother, <a href="Neferhotep%20I">Neferhotep I</a>. This is perhaps indirectly confirmed by the observation that both Sobekhotep IV and Neferhotep I are known to have been particularly active in Abydos.

Chicken (2016 film)

Chicken is a 2016 British <a href="drama%20film">drama film</a> directed by Joe Stephenson. It is based on the play of the same name by Freddie Machin.
Plot.
The film follows Richard, a fifteen-year-old boy with learning difficulties who lives in a shabby caravan with his older brother, Polly. Life for the siblings is harsh, with the engaging, nature-loving teenager yearning for stability while frequently finding himself on the wrong side of his brother's destructive, often violent moods.

Finding it easier to communicate with animals – none more so than his beloved hen, Fiona – Richard nevertheless forms a strong friendship with rebellious seventeen-year-old Annabel, whose family have recently acquired the farmland on which the brothers live. But growing conflict with the new landowners will lead to a situation that severely tests Richard's natural optimism, as a world of privilege collides with the brothers' precarious, marginalised existence.

Awards and Receptions.
Chicken had its World Premiere at the 2015 Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film had it’s International Premiere in competition at the 2015 Busan International Film Festival. It won Grand Jury Award at its US Premiere at the New Hampshire International Film Festival. At the 2016 Giffoni International Film Festival it won 2nd Prize. It screened at Cine A La Vista International Film Festival 2016 where it won Best Film. Other festivals include Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, Schlingel International Film Festival and Dublin International Film Festival where Scott Chamber’s performance as Richard got a Special Critics Circle mention.

The film was shortlisted for Best Director (Joe Stephenson) and Best Newcomer (Scott Chambers) by the British Independent Film Awards. 

It had a limited theatrical release in the UK in May 2016, praised as ‘the sort of British indie which restores faith in cinema’ (CineVue) and received 4 stars from Mark Kermode and Empire Magazine. 

It was then acquired by MUBI UK, and had its British TV Premiere on FilmFour April 2017. It will be released on DVD and Bluray in the UK on September 18th 2017.

Guia Lighthouse (Cascais)

The Guia lighthouse () is an active Portuguese <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a> located at Cabo da Guia, about 2 km west of the centre of <a href="Cascais">Cascais</a>. It is an octagonal tower in white masonry with a red lantern that has a range of 18 nautical miles.

History.
As a result of its position on the estuary of the <a href="Tagus%20River">Tagus River</a>, Cabo da Guia had always been important for navigation. From 1523, this point on the Portuguese coast was illuminated by the chapel of the Hermitage of Our Lady of Guia. In 1537 the brothers of the hermitage raised a tower where a group of four or five oil lights were lit. This light was maintained by the brotherhood, keeping it lit for about eight months of the year.

During the <a href="1755%20Lisbon%20earthquake">1755 Lisbon earthquake</a> the tower was badly damaged, requiring major reconstruction works and equipment replacement. To illuminate several points of the coastline the <a href="Sebasti%C3%A3o%20Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Carvalho%20e%20Melo%2C%201st%20Marquis%20of%20Pombal">Marquis of Pombal</a> ordered six lighthouses to be built, of which the Guia lighthouse was one.
The rebuilt Guia lighthouse was completed in 1761. It now emits a fixed white light, with a range of 19 nautical miles in good visibility, over an arc of 240 degrees. Its tower, which is 23 meters high, is made up of thick masonry walls. It was lined with white tiles in the mid-19th century and renovated in April 2003.

The Guia lighthouse was electrified in 1957. Together with other lighthouses near to Lisbon it was automated in 1982 and is not manned. A monitoring system transmits an SMS message whenever a fault occurs.

Thylophorops

"Thylophorops" is an extinct genus of <a href="didelphine">didelphine</a> <a href="opossums">opossums</a> from the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> of <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. Compared to their close didelphine cousins like the living "<a href="Philander">Philander</a>" and "<a href="Didelphis">Didelphis</a>" (and like the still living "<a href="Lutreolina">Lutreolina</a>") opossums, "Thylophorops" displays specialization towards <a href="carnivory">carnivory</a>, and one species, "T. lorenzinii", is the largest known opossum of all time, which could imply a macropredatory role.

Taxonomy.
"Thylophorops" is rather consistently recovered as a <a href="didelphine">didelphine</a> opossum, most often compared to and usually falling within the "<a href="Didelphis">Didelphis</a>", "<a href="Philander">Philander</a>" and "<a href="Lutreolina">Lutreolina</a>" group. Within "Thylophorops" itself, there are three recognized species:


Biology.
"Thylophorops" species (as well as several other contemporary opossum genera) show a high degree of speciation towards carnivory compared to the still living didelphines. Their premolar and molar teeth were proportionally larger than those of living opossums and their grinding facets imply a more dedicated shearing action; these have been interpreted as "omnivory leading towards carnivory" in Goin et al. 2009 and as more specialized carnivory in posterior studies.

There is evidence that "T. chapadmalensis" re-appropriated burrows from other digging mammals, as well as outright consuming them. "Thylophorops" species as a whole tended to be terrestrial rather than arboreal.

Paleoecology.
"Thylophorops" lived at a time when South America's older predatory guilds were dismantling. It co-existed with only a few <a href="sparassodont">sparassodont</a> and <a href="phorusrhacid">phorusrhacid</a> taxa like "<a href="Thylacosmilus">Thylacosmilus</a>" and "<a href="Llallawavis">Llallawavis</a>", and it, as well as similar opossum species, evolved to fill the ecological blanks. A similar case is observed with the carnivorous <a href="armadillo">armadillo</a> "<a href="Macroeuphractus">Macroeuphractus</a>", a product of this same era of faunal turn-overs.

As mentioned above, there is evidence of "T. chapadmalensis" predating on contemporary <a href="caviomorph">caviomorph</a>s and appropriating burrows, from them or other mammals such as <a href="armadillos">armadillos</a>.

Constantine Historic Commercial District

The Constantine Historic Commercial District is a primarily commercial historic district located in <a href="Constantine%2C%20Michigan">Constantine, Michigan</a> along Washington Street between Second and Water Streets, and along Water Street between White Pigeon Street and 125 West Water. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1985.

History.
Constantine was first settled in 1828; by 1830 there was a mill and five families at the location, and the village itself was platted in 1831. The area was easily accessible from the <a href="Chicago%20Road">Chicago Road</a>, and following the removal of the government land office from White Pigeon, Constantine emerged as the principal settlement in the area. By 1840, over 800 people lived in the village. Industrial buildings were constructed along the river to take advantage of the water power and the easy access to transportation. Commercial enterprises first appeared along Water Street, abut as the village grew, merchants began locating along Washington Street.

The first commercial buildings in the village were wooden <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival</a> structures. Although many of these were destroyed by fire over the years, five still survive within the district. These include one building at 145 S. Washington which still exhibits its original 1850s storefront facade, as well as the Barry warehouse at 125 W. Water, which was owned by the prominent merchant and three-time governor <a href="John%20S.%20Barry">John S. Barry</a>. Constantine did not become a railroad stop until the 1870s, and it slipped behind other settlements in shipping and transportation. However, with the onset of the 1870s, a number of substantial and ornate <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> commercial buildings were constructed in the district.

As the 20th century arrived, development shifted to outside the district, so that all but one of the buildings located within this district were constructed before 1916. By the 1950s, more outlying commercial districts began pulling customers away from the downtown. In the 1970s, redevelopment began in the downtown.

Description.
The Constantine Historic Commercial District contains 34 commercial and residential structures within a 5-acre area. Most of the structures are mid-nineteenth to early twentieth century <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival</a> and <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> buildings. The district is particularly notable for the integrity of its historic storefronts: unlike similar commercial districts, 3/4 of the buildings in this district retain the original street level design elements.

Significant buildings within the district include:

2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists

On 17 August 2017, three <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> pro-democracy activists – <a href="Joshua%20Wong%20%28activist%29">Joshua Wong</a>, <a href="Nathan%20Law">Nathan Law</a>, and <a href="Alex%20Chow">Alex Chow</a> – were given jail sentences by the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Court of Appeal</a> for their roles in a protest at the <a href="Civic%20Square%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Civic Square</a> in front of the <a href="Central%20Government%20Complex%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Central Government Complex</a> in <a href="Tamar%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Tamar</a>, <a href="Admiralty%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Admiralty</a>, on 26 and 27 September 2014. The events at the Civic Square helped set off <a href="2014%20Hong%20Kong%20protests">massive pro-democracy protests</a>, sometimes referred to as the <a href="Umbrella%20Movement">Umbrella Movement</a>, which lasted until police cleared the last of the protest sites in December 2014.

The three had originally been convicted and given <a href="community%20service">community service</a> orders or, in the case of Chow, a <a href="suspended%20sentence">suspended sentence</a>. The government appealed their sentences and successfully pursued harsher punishments. The trio's imprisonment was applauded by the <a href="Pro-Beijing%20camp%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">pro-Beijing camp</a> but decried by pro-democracy figures in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> as well as international politicians and <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> advocates, who have called the activists Hong Kong's first prisoners of conscience, and alleged that the sentence is intended to intimidate other would-be activists. 

The sentence also disqualifies the three from running for office for five years, quashing their political aspirations in the near future. Wong had previously sought election but was barred due to his age, while Law, democratically elected to the <a href="Legislative%20Council%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Legislative Council</a> in September 2016, was removed from office in July 2017 following a <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Legislative%20Council%20oath-taking%20controversy">government challenge</a>.

Background.
Activists.
Wong, Law, and Chow have been prominent democracy activists for several years. <a href="Joshua%20Wong%20%28activist%29">Joshua Wong</a>, now a student at the <a href="Open%20University%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Open University of Hong Kong</a>, co-founded <a href="Scholarism">Scholarism</a> in 2011. Scholarism gained prominence as one of several civil society organisations that protested the "<a href="Moral%20and%20National%20Education">Moral and National Education</a>" curriculum, proposed by the <a href="Education%20Bureau">Education Bureau</a>. He subsequently participated in the Umbrella Movement and then co-founded a political party, <a href="Demosist%C5%8D">Demosistō</a>, in 2016.

<a href="Nathan%20Law">Nathan Law</a> is an undergraduate student at <a href="Lingnan%20University%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Lingnan University</a> as well as the incumbent chairman of Demosistō. He previously occupied various leadership positions in the Lingnan University Students' Union and served as Secretary General of the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Federation%20of%20Students">Hong Kong Federation of Students</a>. During the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20legislative%20election%2C%202016">2016 Legislative Council election</a> Law ran under the Demosistō banner in the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Island%20%28constituency%29">Hong Kong Island geographical constituency</a> and was elected, becoming the youngest-ever elected legislator in Hong Kong. On 14 July 2017, Law became one of <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Legislative%20Council%20oath-taking%20controversy">six pro-democracy legislators removed from office</a> due to legal action by the Hong Kong Government regarding their manners during the oath-taking ceremony.

<a href="Alex%20Chow">Alex Chow</a> is a <a href="University%20of%20Hong%20Kong">University of Hong Kong</a> student, a former vice-president of the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20University%20Students%27%20Union">Hong Kong University Students' Union</a>, and a former secretary-general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students. He was one of the early organisers of the Umbrella Movement.

Political context.
The <a href="Chief%20Executive%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Chief Executive</a> is the head of the <a href="Government%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Government of Hong Kong</a>. <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Basic%20Law%20Article%2045">Article 45</a> of Hong Kong's constitution, the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Basic%20Law">Basic Law</a>, stipulates that the "ulimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures". Following the <a href="Transfer%20of%20sovereignty%20over%20Hong%20Kong">transfer of Hong Kong</a> to <a href="China">China</a> in 1997, the pro-democratic camp pushed for the election of the chief executive in 2007 through universal suffrage. On 26 April 2004, the <a href="Standing%20Committee%20of%20the%20National%20People%27s%20Congress">Standing Committee of the National People's Congress</a> (NPCSC), a mainland Chinese legislative body, ruled out the possibility that universal suffrage would be allowed in 2007. In 2007, the NPCSC ruled out the 2012 election of the legislature and chief executive through universal suffrage, but stated that the Legislative Council and the chief executive could be elected through universal suffrage in 2016 and 2017, respectively. 

However, democratic aspirations stalled on 31 August 2014, when the <a href="Standing%20Committee%20of%20the%20National%20People%27s%20Congress">Standing Committee of the National People's Congress</a> in Beijing made <a href="831%20decision">a decision</a> that chief executive candidates in 2017 would be required to "love the country and love Hong Kong"; that all candidates would be screened by a nominating committee of a composition paralleling the existing <a href="Election%20Committee">Election Committee</a>, which is dominated by pro-Beijing interests; and that any chief executive elected through these means would then have to be appointed by the Chinese government. The decision was intensely decried by the pan-democratic camp, who said the arrangement would not amount to genuine democracy.

2014 Civic Square protests.
The incident which led to the sentencing took place in the forecourt of the East Wing of the <a href="Central%20Government%20Complex%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Central Government Complex</a>, known more commonly as the <a href="Civic%20Square%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Civic Square</a>. The new government headquarters was opened in 2011, and was designed under the concept of "Door Always Open" by architect <a href="Rocco%20Design%20Architects">Rocco Yim</a> to symbolise the pride that Hong Kongers take in "openness and transparency of governance". In keeping with this design concept, the Civic Square was originally open to the public when the new government headquarters was inaugurated in 2011.

The square became a popular site for political demonstrations. In mid-2014, several protests were held there against plans for the development of <a href="North%20East%20New%20Territories%20New%20Development%20Areas%20Planning">new towns in the northeastern New Territories</a>. In response, around 16 July 2014 work began on a permanent three-metre high metal fence, closing off the Civic Square from <a href="Tim%20Mei%20Avenue">Tim Mei Avenue</a>. The Hong Kong government stated that the barrier was a necessary security measure while others stated that the move ran contrary to Hong Kong people's right to <a href="freedom%20of%20assembly">freedom of assembly</a>, which is codified in the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Basic%20Law">Basic Law</a>. The government responded that protests would be allowed in the square on public holidays if the director of the Administration Wing consented in advance. Other areas of the complex were fortified at the same time as the Civic Square.

Concurrently with the fortification of the square, the government's controversial <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Hong%20Kong%20electoral%20reform">democratic reform proposals</a>, coupled with the <a href="831%20decision">831 decision</a>, were triggering discontent and protests. On 22 September 2014, students launched a week-long class boycott campaign, coupled with demonstrations at the government complex. At around 22:30 on 26 September 2014, protesting students scaled the fence that had been erected in July in an attempt to "retake" the Civic Square. Police managed to regain control of the square, and <a href="Kettling">kettled</a> dozens of protesters on the circular base of the flagpoles, where they were denied access to water and the toilet. At the same time, a large number of protesters amassed outside the Civic Square. The square was cleared by police by the end of the following day, with more than 60 people arrested. Wong, Chow, and Law were among those arrested.

The incident immediately helped kick off the 2014 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Umbrella Movement, which saw the motorway in front of the government complex, <a href="Harcourt%20Road">Harcourt Road</a>, occupied by protesters until 11 December 2016.

Legal action.
Initial sentencing.
On 21 July 2016, the <a href="Magistrates%27%20Court%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Eastern Magistrates' Court</a> found Wong and Chow guilty of taking part in an unlawful assembly, while Law was found guilty of inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly. These were the first criminal convictions for all three. Wong was cleared of a charge of inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly.

On 15 August 2016, the three were sentenced. Wong was given an 80-hour <a href="community%20service%20order">community service order</a>, while Law was sentenced to 120 hours of community service. Chow was sentenced to three weeks in jail with a <a href="Suspended%20sentence">one year suspension</a> to allow him to continue his education at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a> as planned.

Immediately following the sentencing, Law said that they respected the decision of the court, and alleged that the <a href="Public%20Order%20Ordinance">Public Order Ordinance</a> was "suppressing [their] freedoms to assemble and protest".

The trio subsequently served these initial sentences.

Appeal and additional sentence.
The <a href="Department%20of%20Justice%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Department of Justice</a> disagreed with the sentencing. In September 2016 it requested a review of the sentences, arguing that the community service sentence was "clearly not enough" as the three "[did] not feel true remorse". 

A review hearing was held on 21 September 2016, where the magistrate stated that the original sentencing and reasoning was sufficient, and that the department had "failed to provide sufficient evidence for the necessity of a tougher sentence". The department had compared the activists to gangsters, which the presiding magistrate, June Cheung, said was unfair as they were expressing their political beliefs. She stated that there were precedents for noncustodial sentences in similar cases, and dismissed the bid to impose harsher sentences on the three.

In October 2016, the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Court of Appeal</a> agreed to hear a government appeal against the original sentence.
On 17 August 2017, the Court of Appeal found Wong and Chow guilty of unlawful assembly, and sentenced them to six and seven-month jail terms respectively. Law was found guilty of inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly and sentenced to eight months in jail. 

The sentencing also prevents the activists from running for public office in the next five years. Law was previously an elected legislator, while Wong has expressed a desire to seek election in the future, having been barred from running in the 2016 LegCo election due to his young age.

Imprisonment.
Wong was sent to Pik Uk Correctional Institution, a maximum security facility for male prisoners below the age of 21.

Law and Chow are being held at Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre pending their transfer to prison.

Reactions.
Domestic.
Upon the sentencing, Joshua Wong wrote in a series of <a href="Twitter">tweets</a>:

Other pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong also decried the court decision. University of Hong Kong professor <a href="Benny%20Tai">Benny Tai</a>, also facing prosecution for his role in the 2014 protests, stated that civil disobedience, to "challenge the law or acts of injustice by the government", is a necessary part of a civilised society. Lawyer Wilson Leung stated, "we strongly disagree with the government treating political problems as ‘law and order’ problems and focusing on the prosecution of protestors."

The <a href="League%20of%20Social%20Democrats">League of Social Democrats</a> held a rally against the decision outside the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre on the evening of 18 August 2017. Several different organisations held a public protest march on 20 August 2017, which started at the <a href="Southorn%20Playground">Southorn Playground</a> and ended with a rally at the <a href="Court%20of%20Final%20Appeal%20Building">Court of Final Appeal Building</a>. Protesters focused their criticism on Secretary for Justice <a href="Rimsky%20Yuen">Rimsky Yuen</a>, following reports that he ignored the advice of top prosecutors in pursuing the appeal.

On the other hand, members of the <a href="Pro-Beijing%20camp%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">pro-Beijing camp</a> applauded the prison sentences. <a href="Starry%20Lee">Starry Lee</a>, chairwoman of Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing political party, the <a href="Democratic%20Alliance%20for%20the%20Betterment%20and%20Progress%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong</a> (DAB), said that the three "paid the price" for disobeying the law. DAB vice-chairman <a href="Holden%20Chow">Holden Chow</a> called unlawful assembly a "serious crime" and said that a heavy punishment was necessary to deter others. Pro-Beijing activist <a href="Robert%20Chow">Robert Chow</a> asked <a href="Rhetorical%20question">rhetorically</a>: "who worked behind the scenes to poison and brainwash Wong, Law, and Chow, along with thousands of young people, to make them delight in seeing the country and Hong Kong as enemies, in having made Hongkongers suffer for the last three years?"

Mainland China.
An editorial in the Chinese state mouthpiece "<a href="Global%20Times">Global Times</a>" stated,

<a href="Hua%20Chunying">Hua Chunying</a>, spokeswoman for China's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, stated that "no one can use the excuse of so-called democracy and freedom to carry out illegal violent acts".

International.
The Taiwanese government expressed its "deep regret" over the jail sentences, and reiterated Taiwan's "long-standing stance to support Hong Kong people to pursue democracy, freedom, the rule of law and human rights". The <a href="Democratic%20Progressive%20Party">Democratic Progressive Party</a> stated that "graver suppression will only spark more resistance", while a government spokesman stated that "Hong Kong authorities should take seriously the fact that Hong Kong people want to be able to choose their own way of life and political regime."

<a href="Nancy%20Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>, leader of the United States <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, called the ruling an injustice that should "shock the conscience of the world". She wrote:

A group of 20 international figures released a joint statement describing the jailings as "outrageously unjust". The signatories called the Umbrella Movement "one of the most peaceful and restrained movements of public protest the world has ever seen" and wrote that the sentencing amounted to "an outrageous miscarriage of justice, a death knell for Hong Kong’s rule of law and basic human rights, and a severe blow to the principles of 'One Country, Two Systems'". The statement was signed by eminent politicians, human rights activists, and ex-political prisoners including <a href="David%20Alton">David Alton</a>, <a href="Paddy%20Ashdown">Paddy Ashdown</a>, <a href="Sonja%20Biserko">Sonja Biserko</a>, <a href="Charles%20Maung%20Bo">Charles Maung Bo</a>, <a href="Fiona%20Bruce">Fiona Bruce</a>, <a href="John%20Dayal">John Dayal</a>, Andrew Khoo, <a href="David%20Kilgour">David Kilgour</a>, <a href="John%20McCarthy%20%28ambassador%20born%201947%29">John McCarthy</a>, <a href="Mohamed%20Nasheed">Mohamed Nasheed</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20Nice">Geoffrey Nice</a>, <a href="Consiglio%20Di%20Nino">Consiglio Di Nino</a>, <a href="Grover%20Rees%20III">Grover Rees III</a>, <a href="Malcolm%20Rifkind">Malcolm Rifkind</a>, <a href="Janelle%20Saffin">Janelle Saffin</a>, <a href="Charles%20Santiago">Charles Santiago</a>, <a href="Chris%20Smith%20%28New%20Jersey%20politician%29">Chris Smith</a>, <a href="Charles%20Tannock">Charles Tannock</a>, Alissa Wahid, and <a href="Zarganar">Zarganar</a>. 

The group also questioned whether punishing the activists twice (as Wong, Law, and Chow have already served their initial sentences) contravenes the <a href="International%20Covenant%20on%20Civil%20and%20Political%20Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR). With respect to <a href="double%20jeopardy">double jeopardy</a>, the ICCPR states under Article 14 (7): 

The ICCPR has applied to Hong Kong since 1976.

Academics.
Eric Cheung, a faculty member at the <a href="University%20of%20Hong%20Kong%20Faculty%20of%20Law">University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law</a>, questioned why the Court of Appeal decision described the defendants' actions as "seriously violent" while earlier the Eastern Magistracy had cleared the trio of committing any acts of violence. He stated that there did not seem to be any evidence presented that the three committed violence, and questioned whether the Court of Appeal had effected a "substantial and grave injustice". He said there were grounds for the three to appeal the ruling to the <a href="Court%20of%20Final%20Appeal%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Court of Final Appeal</a>, Hong Kong's <a href="court%20of%20last%20resort">court of last resort</a>.

Human rights organisations.
Various human rights organisations also spoke against the sentencing. A spokesperson for <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> stated that the effort to put the trio in jail was "not about public order, but is instead a craven political move to keep the trio out of the Legislative Council, as well as deter future protests." Similarly, Mabel Au, a spokeswoman for <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International Hong Kong</a>, commented, "the relentless and vindictive pursuit of student leaders using vague charges smacks of political payback by the authorities."

Maya Wang, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, stated: "This is a watershed moment for Hong Kong. It now has political prisoners ... For anyone thinking of protesting, the prospect of a harsh jail sentence will now loom over them."

Other jailings.
This article focuses on the three most well-known activists to be jailed in 2017. The high-profile imprisonment of Wong, Law, and Chow spurred some Hong Kong media outlets to compile lists of all individuals who have allegedly been imprisoned for political reasons. On 15 August 2017, 13 protesters who stormed the Legislative Council building in June 2014 (during a protest against the planned <a href="North%20East%20New%20Territories%20New%20Development%20Areas%20Planning">North East New Territories new towns</a>) were handed prison sentences of eight to 13 months after a similar push by the Department of Justice for more severe sentences than the community service orders they originally received.

Without Mercy

Without Mercy is the fourth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by English band <a href="The%20Durutti%20Column">The Durutti Column</a>, released in October 1984 on <a href="Factory%20Records">Factory Records</a>. After the band and label boss <a href="Tony%20Wilson">Tony Wilson</a> were unanimous in their dislike of "<a href="Another%20Setting">Another Setting</a>" (1983), Wilson pushed the band towards progressing to a new, <a href="classical%20music">classical</a>-inspired sound. The band went on to record "Short Stories for Pauline", which went unreleased when Wilson refused to release it, though one track, "Little Mercy", kept Wilson's attention. He asked the band to use it as the foundation for a different album, ultimately becoming "Without Mercy".

With a dramatically extended line-up, featuring classical musicians such as cello player <a href="Caroline%20Lavelle">Caroline Lavelle</a> and <a href="Tuxedomoon">Tuxedomoon</a> violinist <a href="Blaine%20L.%20Reininger">Blaine L. Reininger</a>, "Without Mercy" was recorded in <a href="Strawberry%20Studios">Strawberry Studios</a>. It was partly an attempt by Wilson to push Durutti Column band leader <a href="Vini%20Reilly">Vini Reilly</a> into spending more than three days recording an album, although the album was recorded in only five days. The album is an album-length, two-part <a href="modern%20classical">modern classical</a> piece, also titled "Without Mercy", using the narrative of <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>' poem "<a href="La%20Belle%20Dame%20sans%20Merci">La Belle Dame sans Merci</a>", which also gives the album its name. Using a blend of new and old instruments, the piece is subdued and orchestrated, with strong elements of <a href="minimalist%20music">minimalist</a> and <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a>.

The extended line-up premiered the album at <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>'s <a href="Riverside%20Studios">Riverside Studios</a> in October 1984 before playing at Wilson's nightclub <a href="The%20Ha%C3%A7ienda">The Hacienda</a> and the <a href="Institute%20of%20Contemporary%20Arts">Institute of Contemporary Arts</a>. The album sleeve, designed by 8vo and featuring <a href="Henri%20Matisse">Henri Matisse</a>'s "Trivaux Pond" painting glued onto card, has been cited as innovative. Upon its release, the album reached number 8 on the <a href="UK%20Independent%20Albums%20Chart">UK Indie Albums Chart</a> and also found success in Japan. Critics have been generally favourable, generally complimenting the piece's peaceful nature and seeing it as a progression in the band's sound, though some contemporary and retrospectives have more mixed opinions, and Veilly has disowned the album. The album has been re-released several times.

Background.
Although the Manchester-based Durutti Column's third album, "<a href="Another%20Setting">Another Setting</a>" (1983), moved the band away from its <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a>-derived <a href="dream%20pop">dream pop</a> sound and into a somewhat <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a>-derived style, Durutti Column leader <a href="Vini%20Reilly">Vini Reilly</a>, alongside <a href="Tony%20Wilson">Tony Wilson</a>, the head of the band's label <a href="Factory%20Records">Factory Records</a>, were displeased with the record, with Wilson especially finding it too similar to the band's previous labum "<a href="LC%20%28album%29">LC</a>" (1981). He recalled: ""Another Setting" trod the same ground as L.C. and took nothing forward. It was time for a change." The group subsequently recorded a new album, "Short Stories for Pauline", in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> in early 1983, a largely instrumental album, while touring Belgium with poet <a href="Anne%20Clark%20%28poet%29">Anne Clark</a>.

However, with Wilson being displeased with "Short Stories of Pauline", the album went unreleased for many decades until <a href="LTM%20Recordings">LTM Recordings</a> released it in 2011, highlighting the deteriorating relationship between Reilly and Wilson. Nonetheless, one track from the album, a "superlative instrumental for piano and violin" entitled "Little Mercy," also known as "Duet" or "La Douleur", in which Veilly was accompanied by violinist <a href="Blaine%20L.%20Reininger">Blaine L. Reininger</a> of <a href="Tuxedomoon">Tuxedomoon</a>, caught Wilson's attention in particular. With the "Pauline" album shelved, Wilson asked that Reilly develop and expand "Little Mercy" into a full album, complete with orchestration, pushing Reilly and the Durutti Column into <a href="modern%20classical">modern classical</a> composition, resulting in "Without Mercy". In the words of Factory biographer James Nice, "Tony Wilson hoped that Vini Reilly might yet become <a href="Bohuslav%20Martinu">Bohuslav Martinu</a> or <a href="Phillip%20Glass">Phillip Glass</a>.

Recording.
The Durutti Column's line-up (at the time consisting of Vini Reilly and percussionist <a href="Bruce%20Mitchell%20%28drummer%29">Bruce Mitchell</a>), was temporarily extended for the orchestral "Without Mercy", now including Blaine Reininger (violin, viola), <a href="Caroline%20Lavelle">Caroline Lavelle</a> (cello), Marvyn Fletcher (saxophone), <a href="Tim%20Kellett">Tim Kellett</a> (trumpet), Maunagh Fleming (cor anglais and oboe) and Richard Henry (trombone). Reilly played guitar, piano and bass and, in addition to Mitchell, who performed numerous percussive instruments, also programmed <a href="Oberheim%20DMX">Oberheim DMX</a> drum machines on the album. The album was recorded at <a href="Strawberry%20Studios">Strawberry Studios</a>, <a href="Stockport">Stockport</a>, with Wilson co-producing the album – his first production on a Durutti Column album – with Michael Johnson, who also engineered the record. Johnson was best known for typically engineering <a href="New%20Order%20%28band%29">New Order</a>'s records. It was then mixed at <a href="Britannia%20Row%20Studios">Britannia Row Studios</a> and mastered at CTS Studios.

The recording of "Without Mercy" was also an attempt on the behalf of Wilson to get Reilly to spend more than only three days in the recording of a Durutti Column album, "to try and slow down the process," thereby "stretching the recording possibilities of the simplistic Durutti Column;" Mick Middles of "<a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a>" reflected: "Quite why the anti-punk aspects of this exercise didn't dawn on him remains an intriguing question." "Without Mercy" was subsequently recorded in only five days, which Wilson deemed "an abject failure." 

Music.
Using "Little Mercy" as its foundation, "Without Mercy" is a two-part, album-length instrumental piece or <a href="musical%20suite">musical suite</a>, with the first part ("Without Mercy 1") on side one and the second part ("Without Mercy 2") on side two.
It expands greatly upon the <a href="classical%20music">classical</a> orchestration and accompaniment which were present on "Another Setting", especially via the appearance of the numerous additional musicians, and the inclusion of instruments as disperse as <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>, <a href="viola">viola</a> and <a href="cor%20anglais">cor anglais</a>, alongside Mitchell's percussion and Veilly's work on guitar, keyboard and bass, contribute to a blend of new and old instruments. <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>' ballad poem "<a href="La%20Belle%20Dame%20sans%20Merci">La Belle Dame sans Merci</a>" (1819) was used for the album's narrative, which Wilson described as "boy meets girl, boy loses girl and no birds sing." Prendergast described the album as an orchestral "musical setting" for Keats' poem. The name of the poem also gives the album its name.

According to critic <a href="Ned%20Raggett">Ned Raggett</a>, "reflection and subdued but not inactive performing are the key", even during the album's busiest moments, with many points of the album being somewhat reminiscent of <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a>, while "Reilly is almost always, either via keyboards or his guitar, front and center." Reinginer's violin and viola and Lavelle's cello are said to add "even more classical atmosphere" to the album. The album is delicate, and often particularly <a href="minimalist%20music">minimalist</a> in nature. Peter Mills of "<a href="Rough%20Guides">Rough Guides</a>" compared "Without Mercy" to <a href="Mike%20Oldfield">Mike Oldfield</a>'s "<a href="Tubular%20Bells">Tubular Bells</a>". Critics regard the record as a delve into <a href="modern%20classical">modern classical</a> and <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a>.

The entire composition is "underpinned by a recurrent, mournful piano riff, plaintive violin and stirring brass." "Without Mercy 1" begins with Reilly's melancholic piano, followed by <a href="oboe">oboe</a> from Manaugh Fleming and trumpet from Tim Kellet alongside Reilly's guitar, "adding in here and there as needed while the track unfolds further to [a] Reilly guitar solo." "<a href="Trouser%20Press">Trouser Press</a>" felt it was "like modern chamber music, an ambitious and shifting mixture of piano, horns, strings and electronic percussion." An entire studio group is used on "Without Mercy 2," which favours guiar. Blaine Reininger reprises his role as violinist from "Little Mercy". Roughly eight minutes into the second side, "funky horns and beats" start to appear.

Release.
"Without Mercy" was released in the United Kingdom by <a href="Factory%20Records">Factory Records</a> in October 1984 with the catalog number FACT 84, and was also concurrently released in Spain and Italy. It was only the third Factory album to be officially advertised in the music press, via an <a href="brutalist%20architecture">New Brutalist</a>-styled half-page advert in the "NME" reading "Durutti Column Piss on <a href="The%20Art%20of%20Noise">The Art of Noise</a>." The album had already been premiered live in August 1984 at London's <a href="Riverside%20Studios">Riverside Studios</a> with the nine-piece "orchestra," followed by further performances at Wilson's Manchester nightclub <a href="The%20Ha%C3%A7ienda">The Hacienda</a> on 12 December and at the <a href="Institute%20of%20Contemporary%20Arts">Institute of Contemporary Arts</a> in London shortly after. The band's drummer <a href="Bruce%20Mitchell%20%28drummer%29">Bruce Mitchell</a> later contended that ""Without Mercy" demonstrated Tony's flair for marketing and PR. It definitely changed perceptions of Vini as a composing musician, so it was an accurate reading of the media. But Vini had to be forced to do it."

The album sleeve, described by Nice as a "genuinely classic sleeve," was the first project completed by typographically-led design studio 8vo, a collaboration between Mark Holt and Simon Johnston that had been approached after Factory's in-house designer <a href="Peter%20Saville%20%28graphic%20designer%29">Peter Saville</a> "made little progress on his first Durutti sleeve," and the success of the "Without Mercy" sleeve meant that 8vo became Durutti's sleeve designers of choice thereafter. It features <a href="Henri%20Matisse">Henri Matisse</a>'s scenic painting "Trivaux Pond" (1916–17) glued onto recycled pulp board, alongside <a href="letterpress%20printing">letterpress-printed</a> type "reminiscent of the flowing poetry of Guillaume Apollinaire," with both the flow and the font on the sleeve chosen to reflect the <a href="post-impressionism">post-impressionist</a> period of Matisse's painting. With the painting being physically glued onto the sleeve, it was cited as an innovative sleeve by Prendergast.

Reception and legacy.
"Without Mercy" was a relative commercial success, reaching number 8 on the <a href="UK%20Independent%20Albums%20Chart">UK Independent Albums Chart</a>,</small> and also bringing the band strong success in Japan, where the group would record the CD-only live album "Domo Arigato" the following year. "Without Mercy" also received positive reviews from contemporary critics, though, with Reilly moving in an increasingly less "rock" direction, they struggled to find suitable frames of reference, with reviewer Martin Aston calling it "a source of fragility that approaches the minimal mastery of <a href="Brian%20Eno">Eno</a> or even <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a>, employing both the drifting dream states of the former and the frozen delicacy of the latter." Aston was favourable towards the record, saying "Reilly, single-handedly, could alter the meaning of <a href="easy%20listening">easy listening</a>, and with this in mind, it's about time that this strain of musical input found a more comfortable home than that of the elite and esoteric."

Although unsure of the album's second side, "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>" called the album "beautiful without being cloying" and "quietly impressive." Steph Paynes of the "<a href="NME">NME</a>" were more reserved, saying the album was "one good idea stretched to album length": "The tune eventually evolves into variations of itself. But it does so without a clear direction and without much adventure. Some of the gestures work nicely; others are inappropriate, inserted for the sake of change."
Band biographer James Nice later reflected: "'Duet' says everything it needs to say in two and a half minutes. Stretched across the entire "Without Mercy" album, more became less." Other retrospective reviews have been favourbale, with <a href="Ned%20Raggett">Ned Raggett</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> saying: "It's very self-consciously romantic (track and album are in fact named for Keats' noted poem La Belle Dame Sans Merci), but the combination of new and old instruments, plus the continuation of the unique Durutti sheen and shine in the recording quality, results in quietly touching heights."

As with many other Durutti Column LPs, Reilly dislikes the album, once telling a writer for "<a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a>" that he jokingly calls it "Without Merit," and reflecting: ""Without Mercy" is a joke. [...] It was all Tony Wilson's idea to make it more classical. He had aspirations that I should be taken more seriously. That never interested me. Everyone's obsessed with form. 'Is it <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a>? Is it <a href="jazz">jazz</a>?' It's just tunes." He elaborated: "That album was Tony Wilson saying to me, ‘You've done so many albums the way you wanted to do them, and when you wanted to do them, so just this once make this my record and do it my way.' He's one of my best friends, so of course I said yeah. And that's "Without Mercy". There were all these studio classical musicians involved. For me it doesn't actually work. It was more of a learning process really."

Reissues.
In March 1988, "Without Mercy" was re-issued on as part of "Durutti Column – The First Four Albums", a four-CD <a href="box%20set">box set</a> that remastered the album, alongside its predecessors in the band's discography, in full digital stereo. <a href="London%20Records">London Records</a> re-released the album on CD in 1998, adding the EP "Say What You Mean, Mean What You Say" (1985), which featured direct excerpts from "Without Mercy", as bonus tracks, alongside two stripped-down pieces of the same period, one of which, "All That Love Maths Can Do", marked the first recorded contribution from violist John Metcalfe on a Durutti Column album.

2017 Turku stabbing

On 18 August 2017, at around 16:00 local time (<a href="UTC%2B3">UTC+3</a>), ten people were stabbed in central <a href="Turku">Turku</a>, <a href="Southwest%20Finland">Southwest Finland</a>. The alarm was first raised at 16:02 and by 16:05 the <a href="Moroccans">Moroccan</a> suspect, an <a href="asylum%20seeker">asylum seeker</a>, had been detained. Two people died in the attack. The <a href="Police%20of%20Finland">police</a> are investigating the case as a <a href="Terrorism">terrorist</a> act. The incident is considered significant as the first suspected terrorist attack in Finland since the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Background.
Finland had been considered to be one of the most peaceful countries in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> in respect to <a href="political%20violence">political violence</a> and terrorism. Finland had not encountered terrorist attacks and had faced only a miniscule amount of political violence since the end of World War II. On 14 June 2017, the <a href="Finnish%20Security%20Intelligence%20Service">Finnish Security Intelligence Service</a> (Supo) assessed the overall terrorist threat as level two ("elevated") on its four tier system. According to Supo, the most significant terrorist threat in Finland was at the time posed by individual actors or small groups motivated by <a href="Islamic%20extremism">radical Islamist</a> propaganda or <a href="List%20of%20designated%20terrorist%20groups">terrorist organisations</a> encouraging them.

Attack.
On 18 August 2017, at 16:02 local time, a single attacker stabbed several people at the <a href="Market%20Square%2C%20Turku">Market Square</a> in central <a href="Turku">Turku</a>, Finland. The attacker then stabbed several more people while running towards <a href="Puutori">Puutori</a>. Bystanders intervened in the attacks and chased the attacker while simultaneously warning other people by yelling.

When police confronted the attacker on the street Brahenkatu near Puutori, he ignored verbal orders and was immobilised with a single shot to the leg at 16:05. The assailant was given first aid and taken into custody.

Casualties.
At least two people died as a result of the attack: one at the scene of the incident, and another at hospital. Eight victims were non-fatally wounded, of whom at least three were critically injured. One of the victims was under 18, the others were adults. Eight of the victims were female and two male. According to the police, the attacker purposely chose females as his victims, while the male victims were injured while trying to help other victims or stop the attacker. One of the wounded was <a href="British%20people">British</a>, one <a href="Italians">Italian</a> and one <a href="Swedes">Swedish</a>; both of the fatalities were <a href="Finns">Finnish</a> women. The British citizen, a paramedic, was injured four times as he tried to help others, according to reports in the Swedish media.

Aftermath.
The <a href="Turku%20City%20Library">Turku City Library</a> and <a href="Hansa%20Emporium">Hansa Emporium</a> were evacuated, and the police initially advised people to avoid the city centre area. Finnish Prime Minister <a href="Juha%20Sipil%C3%A4">Juha Sipilä</a> tweeted on 18 August, at 17:09 local time: "The government is closely following the events in Turku and the ongoing police operation. The government will meet later today."

The Finnish police increased security across the whole nation, such as at <a href="Helsinki%20Airport">Helsinki Airport</a> and <a href="Helsinki%20Central%20railway%20station">Helsinki Central railway station</a> along with other transport hubs across Finland. A crisis service hotline as well as a physical crisis service point were established in the Turku area and the number of social workers was doubled. Flags were flown half-mast on 19 August and a national moment of silence was held at the Market Square on 20 August, at 10:00 local time.

The attack prompted Parliament legislators to debate an accelerated derogation of the on-going intelligence gathering bill. The bill is intended to enhance national security against serious threats, such as terrorism.

Investigation.
At 19:00 local time on 18 August, the police held a press conference where they reported that the nature of the attack had not yet been established.

On 19 August at 14:00 local time, the Finnish <a href="National%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation%20%28Finland%29">National Bureau of Investigation</a> (NBI) announced that the arrested suspect attacker was an 18-year-old <a href="Morocco">Moroccan</a> man, and that the case was now being treated as a suspected terrorist attack. Police reported that the suspect had arrived in Finland at the beginning of 2016 and had been involved in the "<a href="Asylum%20seeker">asylum process</a>", but would not say whether he had received a negative asylum decision. The suspect had refused to answer questions and the attack appeared to have been premeditated. Furthermore, NBI reported that police had raided a flat in the <a href="Varissuo">Varissuo</a> suburb of Turku, home to a large immigrant population, and an asylum-seekers' reception centre in the <a href="Pansio">Pansio</a> suburb of Turku overnight between 18 and 19 August. Four more men with Moroccan backgrounds had subsequently been arrested while one Moroccan person was placed under an <a href="Interpol%20notice">international arrest warrant</a>. A white <a href="Fiat%20Ducato">Fiat Ducato</a> belonging to one of the suspects was seized during the raids.

According to information released by the Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) on 19 August, the suspect attacker was not one of the 350 inviduals monitored by Supo for terrorism prevention purposes. Likewise, the suspect attacker's profile is similar to that of several other recent radical Islamist terror attacks that have taken place in Europe and Supo considers the incident to be the first suspected terrorist strike in Finland. The terrorist threat assessment level would remain unchanged from level two ("elevated") for the time being.

On the morning of 20 August, NBI conducted an approximately 45 minute re-enactment of the event at Market Square and Puutori as a normal phase of investigating serious crimes. Additional locations were searched in the <a href="Runosm%C3%A4ki">Runosmäki</a> suburb of Turku and persons connected to the case were being interviewed. NBI has been gathering photographic and video evidence from the public through a <a href="WhatsApp">WhatsApp</a> account.

Reaction.
National.
Prime Minister <a href="Juha%20Sipil%C3%A4">Juha Sipilä</a> remarked during a press conference on 19 August: "If the criminal charge is confirmed to be terror-related murder, that would be a first in Finland. We have feared this. The day before in Barcelona and now in Turku. We are no longer an island". He added: "This act was cowardly and reprehensible. The killing of innocent people is a violation of humanity and of religions' principles. We are however all in the same boat and we must defend humanity so that hate is not answered with hate."

Interior Minister <a href="Paula%20Risikko">Paula Risikko</a> said on Twitter on 19 August: "Terrorists want to pit people against each other. We will not let this happen. Finnish society will not be defeated by fear or hatred."

On 19 August, protesters from anti-immigration and anti-racism groups staged demonstrations near the site of the stabbing.

The Islamic Council of Finland and the Moroccan Forum in Finland strongly condemned the attack and denounced the use of violence and hatred on 20 August.

International.
Several international leaders, such as the President of France <a href="Emmanuel%20Macron">Emmanuel Macron</a>, the Prime Minister of Sweden <a href="Stefan%20L%C3%B6fven">Stefan Löfven</a>, the Prime Minister of Denmark <a href="Lars%20L%C3%B8kke%20Rasmussen">Lars Løkke Rasmussen</a> and the Prime Minister of Estonia <a href="J%C3%BCri%20Ratas">Jüri Ratas</a> offered their condolences to the victims of the attacks. The European Commission President <a href="Jean-Claude%20Juncker">Jean-Claude Juncker</a> said: "It is with great concern that I have learned of the violent attacks in Turku, Finland. While details are still emerging, we strongly condemn this unprovoked attack which comes only 24 hours after the horror that unfolded in Spain."

Leucothrix (bacteria)

Leucothrix is a genus of large, filamentous bacteria, which live as epiphytes in marine habitats.

Systematics.
"Leucothrix" Oersted, 1844 is the type genus of the family <a href="Leucothricaceae">Leucothricaceae</a> Buchanan, 1957, but has also been classified in the family <a href="Thiotrichaceae">Thiotrichaceae</a> (<a href="Gammaproteobacteria">Gammaproteobacteria</a>). There are two species described, "<a href="Leucothrix%20mucor">L. mucor</a>" Oersted, 1844 (<a href="type%20species">type species</a>) and "L. pacifica" Zhang et al., 2015.

Description.
"Leucothrix" is a large bacterium that forms <a href="Filamentous%20bacteria">filaments</a> between 2-3 µm wide and up to 0.5 cm in length. They are usually found as <a href="Epiphyte">epiphytes</a> on marine plants and algae, but also grow attached to other surfaces like the shells of crustaceans. Like the related genus "<a href="Thiothrix">Thiothrix</a>", individual cells can be released from filaments, forming "<a href="Gonidium">gonidia</a>", which can disperse and colonize new surfaces. On a new surface, the gonidial cells associate, produce a holdfast, and develop into rosettes of new filaments. Filaments of "L. mucor" can sometimes grow into <a href="Knot">knots</a> when cultivated in the laboratory under certain conditions.

Physiologically, "Leucothrix" are <a href="Heterotrophic%20microorganism">chemoheterotrophic</a>, which distinguishes them from "Thiothrix", which are able to use <a href="Microbial%20metabolism%23Sulfur%20oxidation">sulfur oxidation</a> as a source of energy.

Total Espionage doctrine

"Total Espionage doctrine".
"Total Espionage doctrine" is a specific approach to intelligence gathering, implicating as many variable sources as possible. It combines political, economic, military and industrial espionage. Like other types of espionage, it is subdivided into active and passive espionage. It characterizes <a href="authoritarian">authoritarian</a> and <a href="totalitarian">totalitarian</a> regimes. In the XX century total espionage was practiced by Japan, Germany and the Soviet Russia. During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the Soviet <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> often accused the United States of total espionage. 

Kurt Reiss.
Total espionage doctrine was first described by <a href="Kurt%20Riess">Kurt Riess</a> in his 1941 book “Total Espionage: Germany’s Information and Disinformation Apparatus 1932-40.” German intelligence used Germans residing or travelling abroad, as well as foreign sympathizers, to collect all sorts of information – political, scientific, economic, etc. Tourists, scientists, actors, university professors, sailors, auto-mechanics, diplomats, journalists NGO’s and business corporations were instrumentalized to gather intelligence and to sabotage the enemy. One important instrument of intelligence gathering was The Organization of Germans Living Abroad, directed by <a href="Ernst%20Wilhelm%20Bohle">Ernst Wilhelm Bohle</a>, a special assistant to the German Counter-Intelligence (SD) Chief <a href="Walter%20Schellenberg">Walter Schellenberg</a>. Vast network of spies was developed by Goebbels’ Counter-Action (Abwehr) Department jointly with the War Ministry Intelligence Service. This department was also in charge of controlling German-language newspapers in non-German-speaking countries. According to Riess, “by 1937 Goebbels controlled through Winkler, some 330 German newspapers in non-German-speaking countries. This figure did not include the large number of newspapers in Switzerland, Alsace, and Czechoslovakia, nor the newspapers in other languages”. The goal of this control was not only propaganda, but espionage.
Even though Hitler’s total espionage was a prerequisite of <a href="total%20war">total war</a>, Germany’s failure to defeat the Soviet Union quickly was a result of its inability to use the total espionage approach there, according to Riess. 

Roger Deacon.
Intelligence historian Roger Deacon attributed the invention of total espionage strategy to the pre-Revolutionary Russian secret police, known as the “Okhrana”. According to Deacon, this police agency was “the most comprehensive coordinated espionage and counter-espionage organization, the most total form of espionage devised in the latter part of the XIX century and still forming the basis of Soviet espionage and counter-espionage today.” 

Oleg Nechiporenko.
In the early 2000s "total espionage doctrine" resurfaced, due to the efforts of <a href="Oleg%20Nechiporenko">Oleg Nechiporenko</a>, a <a href="KGB">KGB</a> <a href="counter-intelligence">counter-intelligence</a> operative turned espionage theorist. In his 2001 article “Playing on Ennemy’s Field”, discussing ancient Chinese spying strategy, Nechiporenko declared: “The object of espionage can be anything: there is no person, nor any area or a single phenomenon in the enemy’s country that might remain unknown to the opposite side. And the main instrument of this knowledge is spying.” The article was edited by the <a href="Federal%20Security%20Service">Federal Security Service</a>’s Center for Public Relations. 

Valery Gerasimov.
Later total espionage doctrine was incorporated in the so-called "hybrid warfare doctrine" or "the Gerasimov doctrine", named after the Russian Chief of Stuff General <a href="Valery%20Gerasimov">Valery Gerasimov</a>. In Gerasimov’s view, non-military methods could be as efficient if not superior to direct military action. Hybrid warfare doctrine also relied on guerilla war tactics as well as on the concept of <a href="asymmetric%20warfare">asymmetric warfare</a>. Hybrid warfare was used by the Russians during the Crimea annexation and in its war on Donbass. Some of its elements, like faking western media outlets, are used in the Russian covert campaign against the United States and its allies.

Antoine Odier

Antoine Odier (15 May 1766 – 19 August 1853) was a French banker and politician. He was born in Switzerland but moved to France and was naturalized during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> (1789–99). He was involved in the Indian cotton trade before founding a banking house in Paris during the Bourbon Restoration. He was politically liberal, supported the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> of 1830 and opposed the seizure of power by <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> in 1851. He favoured protectionist economic policies, and led a lobby group to oppose lowering of tariffs.

Family background.
Antoine Odier's family, which originated in <a href="Dauphin%C3%A9">Dauphiné</a>, was of the "ancienne noblesse".
An ancestor, also called Antoine Odier, took refuge in Geneva shortly before the end of the 16th century after the revocation of the <a href="Edict%20of%20Nantes">Edict of Nantes</a>.
The Odiers became related by marriage with patrician families in Geneva, and associated with leading merchants.
Antoine Odier's father, Jacques-Antoine Odier, appears to have played an important role in Senn, Bidermann et Cie.
This company had been established in 1781 with the purpose of manufacturing Indian cotton at <a href="Wesserling">Wesserling</a>, Haut-Rhin, and trading in painted canvasses in three export outlets.
When the other leaders of this company moved from Geneva in 1782 to France and Belgium, he was given power of attorney for their affairs in Geneva.

Business career.
Antoine Odier was born on 15 May 1766 in Geneva.
He was the son of Jacques-Antoine Odie by his second wife, Marie Cazenove.
At a very young age he entered the commercial house of Senn, Bidermann et Cie,
Some years before the French Revolution he was given charge of the <a href="Ostend">Ostend</a> outlet, which he transferred to <a href="Lorient">Lorient</a> in 1791 after the suppression of the monopoly of the Compagnie des Indes.
Odier became a Frenchman under the law of 1790, which gives this status to the descendants of refugees.
He supported the <a href="Girondins">Girondins</a>, and was arrested in 1793. 
He was not released until the <a href="Thermidorian%20Reaction">Thermidorian Reaction</a> of 27 July 1794.

After being released Odier moved to Ostend to look after the company's business, then to <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, where he married Susanne Boué, who was like him a descendent of Protestant French refugees.
His children were Henriette (b. 1796), Jacques-Antoine (b. 1798), who later became a judge at the court of commerce, a regent of the Bank of France and a member of the Central Council of Reformed Churches, Edouard-Alexandre (b. 1800), who left commerce to become a painter, Alfred-Auguste (b. 1802), Charles-Philippe (b. 1804), Cécile and Jennny, who both died young and Edmond-Louis (b. 1813).

After returning to France he found that maritime commerce was completely ruined by the British <a href="Continental%20System">Continental System</a>.
He devoted himself to developing the national industry, and from this time forward the manufacture of painted canvas was very successful.
From 1795 Odier was one of the main directors of the company that took over the Wesserling Indian cotton manufacture under the name "Gros, Davillier, Roman et Cie", which soon became "Gros, Davillier, Odier et Cie".
In 1803 Antoine Odier and his father were among the ten associates of the firm Gros, Davillier et Cie.
Antoine Odier was also involved in companies with his two brothers-in-law, and with important merchants such as Jacques Bidermann of <a href="Winterthur">Winterthur</a>.

Odier's fortune and influence grew considerably during the Bourbon Restoration.
He founded a banking house in Paris.
Odier's bank, established during the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">Bourbon Restoration</a> (1815–30), was part of the elite group known as the "haute banque parisienne".
Others established at this time were those of Ardoin, Dassier, d’Eichthal, Vernes and de Waru.
Odier's bank survived just two generations.
He became a member of the Paris Commercial Court, and then president of that court.
He was appointed a censor of the <a href="Bank%20of%20France">Bank of France</a>, a member of the Supervisory Board of the Sinking Fund and of deposits and consignations, and a member of the Superior Council of Commerce in 1819.
Political career.
During the Bourbon Restoration Odier sat in the Chamber of Deputies of the Departments from 24 November 1827 to 16 May 1830.
He represented the <a href="Seine%20%28department%29">Seine department</a> as a member of the liberal opposition.
During the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> he voted for the <a href="Address%20of%20the%20221">Address of the 221</a>, supported the government and supported the policies of <a href="Jacques%20Laffitte">Jacques Laffitte</a> and <a href="Casimir%20Pierre%20P%C3%A9rier">Casimir Pierre Périer</a>.
During the <a href="July%20Monarchy">July Monarchy</a> he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Seine as a member of the liberal opposition, holding office from 19 July 1830 to 31 May 1831.

Odier became a general councilor of the Seine in 1831.
He was reelected Deputy for the Seine for the government majority from 5 July 1831 to 25 May 1834, and again from 21 June 1834 to 3 October 1837.
The Association pour la défense du Travail national was formed to oppose the lowering of tariffs.
The council included Antoine Odier (President), <a href="Auguste%20Mimerel">Auguste Mimerel</a> (Vice-President), <a href="Joseph%20Perier">Joseph Perier</a> (Treasurer) and <a href="Louis-Martin%20Lebeuf">Louis-Martin Lebeuf</a> (Secretary).
Members included <a href="Henri%20Barbet">Henri Barbet</a>, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Talabot">Léon Talabot</a> and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Schneider">Eugène Schneider</a>.

Odier was made a <a href="Peer%20of%20France">Peer of France</a> on 3 October 1837.
He was awarded the cross of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> in 1846.
He sat with the government supporters until the <a href="French%20Revolution%20of%201848">French Revolution of 1848</a>.
He disagreed with the policies of <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>, and after the <a href="French%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20of%201851">coup d'état of 2 December 1851</a> he refused to become a member of the Consultative Commission.
Antoine Odier died on 19 August 1853 in Paris.

Founding of the German Empire

The founding of the German Empire ("Deutsche Reichsgründung)" took place in January 1871 after the joint victory of the German states in the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>. As a result of the <a href="November%20Treaties">November Treaties</a> of 1870s, the southern German states of <a href="Baden">Baden</a>, <a href="Landgraviate%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt">Hesse-Darmstadt</a>, with their territories south of the <a href="Main%20line%20%28political%29">Main line</a>, <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a> and <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, joined the <a href="Prussia">Prussian</a>-dominated "<a href="North%20German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a>" on 1 January 1871. On the same day, the new <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20German%20Confederation%201871">Constitution of the German Confederation</a> came into force, thereby significantly extending the <a href="Federalism%20in%20Germany">federal German lands</a> to the newly created <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>. On the date, when the Empire was founded, the 18 January became day of celebration when the Prussian King <a href="William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm I</a> was proclaimed <a href="German%20Emperor">German Emperor</a> in <a href="Versailles%2C%20Yvelines">Versailles</a>. 

Historically, it was referred to as the "Second German Empire" after the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>.

Terminology.
The founding of the German Empire was not a single act which could be clearly distinguished from others. There are several definitions in literature which can be divided into four periods. However, authors are not always consistent with their distinctions. It also originated from the specific theme or structure of <a href="publication">publication</a>. It is not, in itself, a contradiction, on the one hand, to speak of a chronologically very limited foundation of the German Empire in 1871. On the other hand, often a "Reichgründungsepoche", or "Age of the German Founding" is spoken of, which can often be classified with the <a href="German%20revolutions%20of%201848%E2%80%9349">German revolutions of 1848 and 1849</a>.

Michael Stürmer concentrated on Bismarck in his "Die Reichsgründung" and the years 1866 to 1878 (from the Austro-Prussian War to the Congress of Berlin). It dates back however to the Holy Roman Empire. The actual historic event begins in 1848/1849. The result of the revolution was a "hovering state", "no return to that order which had collapsed like a map house in March 1848, a blockade of central European nationalisation". The "Reichsgründungsepoche" ended during the second half of the 1870s, according to Stürmer with the foreign policy concerning the consolidation of the Empire. Similar to Stürmer, Frank Lorenz Müller posed the same question with clearly answering it:

The "Founding of the German Empire" was briefly described at the turn of the 1870 into 1871. Ernst Rudolf Huber describes the time from the imperial plan of 1870 on the beginning of wain in July, the so-called November Treaties, the constitution of the German Confederation from 1 January, "the establishment of the imperial organs", including the imperial proclamation and the Reichstag election in March until the new constitution of April 1871. It was precisely the imperial proclamation of 18 January 1871 that "in the minds of the Germans, the actual "Reichsgründungsakt" remained", says Theodor Schieder. Andreas Kaernbach complains that:

Various publications include the North German Confederation and its immediate past history. Then, there were the years of 1866 and 1871. A decisive event was the Prussian victory at <a href="Hradec%20Kr%C3%A1lov%C3%A9">Hradec Kralove</a>, which ended the <a href="Austria%E2%80%93Prussia%20rivalry">Austro-Prussian dualism</a>. The <a href="Second%20Schleswig%20War">Second Schleswig War</a> (1864 - Einigungskriege") was accepted as a starting point. Some authors claim the start to be the "Reichsgründungsjahrzehnt" (Decade of the Founding of the German Empire) when the <a href="German%20National%20Association">German National Association</a> was founded in 1859. In the prolongation until 1878, others also speak of the Liberal era. The years around 1878 are also called the "Second Founding of the German Empire" because a new "alliance between harrow and furnace" was formed between entrepreneurs of heavy industry and the feudal elite.

Other authors also speak of a "Reichsgründungszeit" or "Reichsgründsungsepoche" (Time of the Founding of the Empire), or of a "way to founding the empire", meaning the period between 1848/49 and 1871. Christian Jansen sees the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">revolutions of 1848/49</a> as being the "initial firing for the establishment of the founding of the national state" also because of political parties being formed at that time. In this view, the <a href="Frankfurt%20Constitution">Frankfurt Constitution</a> of 1849 was recognised as the first attempt at reconciliation. In the period between 1848 and 1866/1871, dualism was recognised as a problem for the formation of national states and (by war) solved just as much as the <a href="First%20Schleswig%20War">First Schleswig War</a>. Bismarck was active politically in 1848/49 and had proven himself to be concerned with the constitutions of the time. The road to the <a href="Erfurt%20Union">Erfurt Union</a>, with the election of a constituent assembly agreed by the princes, was the model used to found the Federal German Republic in 1867.

Founding of the National State.
The founding of the Empire refers only to the constitutional and, above all, the political-psychological aspect: the subject of international law, whose territory was extended to the "German Confederation" by the November Treaties of 1870, and then renamed the "Deutsches Reich", had existed since the North German Confederation had been converted from a military alliance into a federal state in 1867. 

The "Constitution of the German Confederation", in the version released on 1 January 1871, was followed by an edited version on 16 April 1871, which today is usually referred to as Bismarck's constitution. This finally came into force on 4 May 1871, retroactively to 1 January of that year.

The founding of the Empire had to therefore be examined at various levels, a legal, a parliamentary, and a symbolic level, with the imperial proclamation on 18 January reflecting the symbolic level of acceptance of imperial dignity. Michael Kotulla states that "however, the symbolic character of this act, which was certainly perceived by the public as the birth of the empire, but which was statelessly irrelevant, remained true." This symbolic motion corresponded to the actual reality of the enlarged covenant and now the whole of Germany.

Imperial Proclamation in Versailles.
Background.
The <a href="Austro-Prussian%20War">Austro-Prussian War</a> of 1866 led to the dissolution of the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> founded in 1815 after the <a href="Peace%20of%20Prague%20%281866%29">Prague Treaty</a>. The background of that war was because Otto von Bismarck aimed for a German alliance system under the <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a> of Prussia. According to Bismarck, such a hegemonic power was only possible without Austria, since the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg monarchy</a> was, in fact, economically and militarily too important because of its previous hegemonic leadership of the German Confederation. After the Prussian victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%B6niggr%C3%A4tz">Battle of Hradec Kralove</a>, Bismarck, against the wishes of the Habsburgs, succeeded in forming the North German Confederation as a military alliance in August 1866 without Austria (see also <a href="German%20dualism">German Dualism</a>, <a href="German%20Question">German Question</a>). A year later, the North German Confederation made a constitution and became a <a href="State%20%28polity%29">state</a>.

In 1868, Spanish military queen <a href="Isabella%20II%20of%20Spain">Isabella II</a> was dethroned. Prince <a href="Leopold%2C%20Prince%20of%20Hohenzollern">Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen</a> supported by <a href="Prussia">Prussian</a> Prime Minister <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> acted as a <a href="Glorious%20Revolution%20%28Spain%29">candidate</a> for royal succession in Spain. Shortly after his candidature was accepted, however, Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, under the influence of his father, Prince <a href="Karl%20Anton%2C%20Prince%20of%20Hohenzollern">Karl Anton</a>, and the King of Prussia, proclaimed <a href="William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm I</a> to the throne of Spain because <a href="History%20of%20France">France</a> had threatened war with this candidacy. The <a href="Emperor%20of%20the%20French">Emperor of France</a>, <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>, however, did not want to be satisfied with the simple withdrawal of the candidacy, and sent his ambassador, <a href="Vincent%2C%20Count%20Benedetti">Vincent Benedetti</a>, to <a href="Bad%20Ems">Bad Ems</a>, in order to enter negotiations with the King of Prussia. Napoleon demanded an official apology from Prussia and the general renouncement of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> and <a href="Sigmaringen">Sigmaringer</a> to the Spanish throne also for the future, which King Wilhelm I did not want to accept. (see: <a href="Ems%20Dispatch">Ems Dispatch</a>) "But one wanted more: the Prussian government had not yet been revealed, the victory did not yet seem perfect. That is why Benedetti was commissioned to demand a <a href="Sanctions%20%28law%29">sanction</a> of renunciation from King Wilhelm. The King should declare that he would also forbid the Sigmaringers to accept the Spanish crown."

After Ems Dispatch was acquainted, the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28France%29">French National Assembly</a> granted funds for war, and on 19 July 1870, the <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">French Empire</a> declared <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">war</a> on the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. That is why the southern German states took the side of Prussia in accordance with protection and truss alliances, which were used in defence cases. The following victories over the French <a href="Field%20army">armies</a> in August and September 1870 led to a willingness to grow in Southern Germany to join the North German Confederation as a federation with <a href="Federalism">federal</a> structures. 

Proclamation on 18 January 1871.
On 9 and 10 December 1870, the Reichstag and Bundesrat decided to offer the Emperor's title to the head of the German state (the Prussian king). Wilhelm had taken the title against an imperial deputation of the Reichstag (18 December). In addition, the country was to be renamed "German Reich". This became effective on 1 January 1871 with a new <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20German%20Empire">constitution</a>. The later <a href="proclamation">proclamation</a> was only an "act of formal imprisonment and amputation", the "18 January was not "the day of the German Empire being founded"" (E.R. Huber).

As a day for the imperial proclamation to take place, 18 January was chosen, the day of the royal coronation of Frederick III von Brandenburg, when he was crowned <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick I</a> in 1701, leading to the founding of the Kingdom of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>. The memorial to this event, which has dated back more than 170 years, made it possible for the rise of the Hohenzollerns to be remembered as becoming powerful monarchs of Europe from <a href="Prince-elector">prince-electors</a>.

The will of striving for being a European <a href="great%20power">great power</a>, led to the choice of a distinctive frame, the splendid <a href="Hall%20of%20Mirrors">Hall of Mirrors</a> at the Palace of Versailles, the ceiling on which was celebrated by <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV,</a> the Sun King, as a conqueror of German cities and states. 

On 18 January 1871, German troops marched in parade uniform behind music trains around the <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Palace of Versailles</a>. Now, the delegations of the German field-regiments were crowded in this great room. They raised their banners, torn in battles, into a colourful forest. In the middle of the hall stood an altar, where military-spirits celebrated a worship service, at the end of which, all those present were singing the song "Nun danekt alle Gott" (<a href="Now%20Thank%20We%20All%20Our%20God">Now thank we all our God</a>). At the end of the gallery was an elevated podium, on which Wilhelm I and the Federal Princes stood.

Otto von Bismarck read out the proclamation:

Thereupon, the Grand Duke of Baden issued a high-call to "His Majesty, Kaiser Wilhelm", whom the other attendants replied three times. The ceremony ended, while the hurrah calls continued outside from the deployed troops. The expression "Kaiser Wilhelm" avoided the precise, constitutionally title "German Emperor", with which Wilhelm could not befriend himself.

Only the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Duchy of Brunswick and the Principalities of Reuss (Younger and Older Line), Schwarzburg-Sonderhausen, Waldeck, and Lippe were not represented in the imperial proclamation in Versailles.

Accounts from eye witnesses.
The ceremony has been detailed in numerous accounts from the time, and the most important people and their function were described in detail. In order to conceal the subliminal controversies by mythical concepts, it was said, for example, that the crown had been "cowed by the flood of all German tribes". The founding of the German Empire took place in a contradictory mixture of modesty and grandeur,

The epistle of the new Emperor Wilhelm I, future <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor</a> <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>, who served as the motor of the founding of the German Empire, and the public account made by historian Albert von Pfister, who was present as a soldier, agreed to the fact that a field alter (instead of a throne) was going to be built on the Hall of Mirrors. While Wilhelm I emphasised the religious nature of the ceremony, Bismarck encountered the political content of the becuase he was said to have preferred an actual mood of religious retreat to the pose to victory. Bismarck, surprisingly, openly criticised the Emperor's behaviour, who was afraid to act as an authority against the princes and rather see himself as a master of war, who triumphed with his faithfuls over the subordinates. That is why Wilhelm spontaneously brought the princes to the same level. In Pfister's description, the religious focus of the ceremony which Wilhelm and Bismarck emphasised. He emphasised, on the other hand, the polarising public effect. The three reports appear more authentically than later portrayals, especially the portrayals in source edits and school book presentations between 1918 and 1945, all of which were created under the dominating impression of the shocking defeat of the "Bismarck empire" in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>.

View of the southern German states.
The governments of southern German states, the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Kingdom of Württemberg and the Kingdom of Bavaria, differed greatly in their unity. This was partly not to prevent a large German solution or to maintain one's own <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a>. 

The <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Baden">Grand Duchy of Baden</a> was unconditionally behind the agreement. <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Baden">Grand Duke Frederick I</a> and Prime Minister <a href="Julius%20Jolly%20%28politician%29">Julius Jolly</a> articulated requests for membership on 3 September 1870. They had already applied for membership to the North German Confederation in 1867 and repeatedly in the spring of 1870, which the Northern German Reichstag rejected on Bismarck's action for foreign policy considerations.

The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kingdom of Württemberg</a> was largely German-Austrian oriented. Under the influence of the Württemberg German Party, the Cabinet under the rule of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Charles I of Württemberg</a> sent an envoy to the German headquarters in France on 12 September to conduct negotiations with the North German Confederation about an association. 

The government of the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Hesse">Grand Duchy of Hesse</a> was rather largely German. However, the province of <a href="Upper%20Hesse">Upper Hesse</a>, located north of the river <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a> and the troops of the rest of the Grand Duchy ("Hesse south of the Main") belonged to the North German Confederation, which constituted a certain constraint for the government under <a href="Louis%20III%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Hesse">Grand Duke Louis III</a>. The population and the successor to the throne, the later <a href="Louis%20IV%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Hesse">Louis IV</a>, also supported the <a href="Lesser%20Germany">Lesser German</a> solution. Accordingly, the government abandoned the Great German idea and entered into negotiations with the North German Confederation. 

Of all four sovereign states, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Kingdom of Bavaria</a> was most opposed to German unity. King Louis II was always concerned about independence. It had been promised by Prussian King Wilhelm to keep their independence and integrity. Under the influence of the Bavarian Progressive Party under Marquad Barth, the chamber was largely for German unity. In order to not be isolated, Bavaria entered negotiations with the proposal of a constitutional alliance. This constitutional alliance led to the formation of a new federation with a new federal constitution.

Consequences and evaluation.
The Hall of Mirros in Versailles combined the foundation of the German empire on 18 January 1871 with the victory in the war and was determined by the dominance of uniforms and demonstration of a military state. Principal authorieis, national cabinets, and Prussia's military power led the new empire. The empire of 1871 was nevertheless "much at the same time: <a href="Federation">federal state</a>, <a href="Rechtsstaat">constitutional state</a>, imperial state, Prussian hegemonic state, power and military state, above all it was a <a href="nation%20state">nation state</a>."

The war of France against the North German Confederation and the armies with its confederated southern German states had given strong impetus to the national movement throughout Germany, even thouhg it had not yet been unified to a federal state. It gave the last impetus to the state agreement and on that date the state was proclaimed and celebrated on the ground of the almost defeated opponent. The mood amongst Germans was said to have been passionate on the day of the Emperor's proclamation, whihle the Emperor himslef was more humble. Wilhelm I, who had already grown old, had, in his own opinion, "to exchange the brialliant Prussian crown for a firt-crust" when he communicated with his son.

William L. Marbury, Jr.

William L. Marbury, Jr. (1901–1988) was a prominent 20th-century American lawyer who ran the family firm of Marbury, Miller & Evans (later Piper & Marbury, Piper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe, Piper Rudnick, now <a href="DLA%20Piper">DLA Piper</a>), and was a childhood friend of alleged Soviet spy <a href="Alger%20Hiss">Alger Hiss</a>.

Background.
William Luke Marbury, Jr., was born on September 12, 1901, in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>. 

His father was William Luke Marbury, Sr. (1858–1935); his mother Silvine Slingluff von Dorsner. Marbury Sr.'s family were slave-holding plantation owners in Southern Maryland before he came to Baltimore in the 1870s. Marbury Sr. was a <a href="eugenicist">eugenicist</a> who helped draft a plan to disenfranchise African-Americans. In 1915, he argued before the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> that states had separate rights to discriminate if they chose.

He is likely a descendant of <a href="William%20Marbury">William Marbury</a> (1762–1835), 18th-Century American businessman and one of the "Midnight Judges" appointed by U.S. President <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> the day before he left office. He was plaintiff in the landmark 1803 Supreme Court case <a href="Marbury%20v.%20Madison">Marbury v. Madison</a>. This ancestor came from <a href="Piscataway%2C%20Maryland">Piscataway, Maryland</a>; nearby is <a href="Marbury%2C%20Maryland">Marbury, Maryland</a>.

Marbury, Jr., attended the Episcopal High School of <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria, Virginia</a> and the <a href="Virginia%20Military%20Institute">Virginia Military Institute</a>. In 1921, he graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>. He also graduated from the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>. In 1924, he graduated from <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a> after serving on the school's law review. While at Harvard, he served as editor of the "<a href="Harvard%20Law%20Review">Harvard Law Review</a>" (as later did his friend and protegee, Alger Hiss) and was a member of <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. In November 5, 1923, he gave a speech on the "practical side of the professional and the ideals." In 1925, he passed the Maryland Bar.

Career.
Private practice.
In 1931, Marbury joined his father's firm; he worked there until his death in 1988.

In 1937, he defended the constitutionality of Baltimore County’s denial of a high school education to a colored child.
In 1948, the Board of Overseers of <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> elected him as Fellow of the <a href="Harvard%20Corporation">Harvard Corporation</a>. In 1965, he became a senior fellow. In 1970, he retired from the board.

In 1952, he merged the family firm of Marbury, Miller & Evans with Piper, Watkins, Avirett & Egerton to create Piper & Marbury. In 1999, Piper & Marbury merged with Rudnick & Wolfe of Chicago to form Piper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe, then "the largest U.S. law firm merger in history." In 2002, Piper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe, LLP, dropped "Marbury" from its name.

In 1957, he became general counsel of the <a href="Maryland%20Port%20Authority">Maryland Port Authority</a> and remained so until 1967.

In 1964, Marbury was among "fifty of the country's most prominent lawyers" who joined a public statement that rebuked U.S. Senator <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a> for attacks he made on the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>.

In 1966, he tried but failed to "censure" key provisions of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201968">Civil Rights Act of 1968</a>.

In 1965, he served one year as president of the <a href="Maryland%20State%20Bar%20Association">Maryland State Bar Association</a> (as his father William L. Marbury, Sr., had done in 1910).

He organized the Maryland Legal Aid Bureau. He was also one of the original members of the <a href="Lawyers%20Committee%20for%20Civil%20Rights%20Under%20Law">Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</a> under U.S. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, to aid civil rights cases.

Government service.
In 1930, Marbury served for a years as assistant attorney general for the State of Maryland. 

In 1940, Marbury served under Judge <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a> for a year as expert consultant on procurement to U.S. Secretary of War <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a>. In 1942, he served three years as chief legal advisor on procurements for the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Air%20Corps">U.S. Army Air Corps</a> at the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20War">U.S. Department of War</a>). In September 1945, he left war-time government service to resume private law practice in Baltimore.

In 1948, he served as an U.S. delegate to the second session of signatories of <a href="General%20Agreement%20on%20Tariffs%20and%20Trade">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a> (GATT) in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, Switzerland. On August 8, 1948, he received instructions to attend that meeting and did not return to the States until September 12.

In 1971, he became a member of the <a href="Maryland%20Commission%20on%20Judicial%20Disabilities">Maryland Commission on Judicial Disabilities</a>, where he served until 1983.

Hiss Case.
The family of Alger Hiss sat one pew in front of the Marbury family at their Episcopalian church in Baltimore. One of Marbury's sisters worked at the Johns Hopkins University library while Hiss studied there. His cousin Jesse Slingluff, Jr., was a fraternity brother with Hiss in <a href="Alpha%20Delta%20Phi">Alpha Delta Phi</a>, as was his wife's brother, Hugh Judge Jewett, Jr. (who was in Hiss' class). By 1929, they had become "close personal friends" as adults. Both attended each other's weddings; Hiss was godfather to one of Marbury's children.

Marbury was involved in the Hiss Case (hearings, trials, afterwards) for the rest of his life, with a detailed legal essay coming out in 1981 and a memoir near the time of his death in 1988.

On August 3, 1948, senior "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" editor <a href="Whittaker%20Chambers">Whittaker Chambers</a>, under subpoena before the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC), mentioned as a member of the <a href="Ware%20Group">Ware Group</a>, a spy ring he had run in Washington during the 1930s.

On August 5, 1948, Marbury took Hiss to the offices of <a href="Covington%20%26amp%3B%20Burling">Covington & Burling</a> (where brother <a href="Donald%20Hiss">Donald Hiss</a> worked) for a meeting with Hiss classmate (and Marbury friend) Joe Johnson, helped him prepare his statement, and then "accompanied" (i.e., not formally as "counsel") Hiss before <a href="HUAC">HUAC</a>. Thereafter, he left the States for three weeks in Europe on government business.

In the "three-ring circus" of HUAC hearings in Washington, libel lawsuit in Baltimore, and <a href="Grand%20Jury">Grand Jury</a> investigation in New York during 1948, Marbury led the Hiss defense team in the libel suit against Chambers. 

As Marbury summarized the situation: It seemed to me inevitable that if he [Hiss] failed to sue Chambers, his reputation would be so irretrievably destroyed that the <a href="Carnegie%20Endowment%20for%20International%20Peace">Endowment</a> would have to dispense with his services anyhow... I warned both Alger and Priscilla that if there were any <a href="Skeleton%20in%20the%20closet%20%28idiom%29">skeletons in the closet</a> of either one of them, they would certainly be discovered if suit were filed, and they both assured me there was no cause for worry on that count... I again warned about skeletons in the closet and mentioned the case of <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, but Alger brushed this aside, saying that he had nothing to hide. While Marbury was in Europe, Hiss worked with numerous lawyers led by <a href="Edward%20Cochrane%20McLean">Ed McLean</a> of <a href="Debevoise%20%26amp%3B%20Plimpton">Debevoise, Plimpton & McLean</a> in New York. While McLean feared that a libel case would come to court too slowly in New York, Marbury argued that Hiss could file in Chambers' home state of Maryland through a Federal Court in Baltimore, if they acted within 60 days. Hiss switched out McLean for Marbury as lead counsel and filed the libel suit on September 27, 1948. During pre-trial proceedings, he recalled, "I made demand on him to produce anything whatsoever which he had in his possession in the way of written evidence which would substantiate his story, and particularly any communications from Alger or Priscilla Hiss." Chambers brought forward the "Baltimore Documents" that included papers handwritten by Hiss and typed on the Hiss family typewriter. Marbury recalled, "I was shocked when I recognized what seemed to be Alger's handwriting... I was fully aware of the devastating effect that these memoranda would be certain to have on Alger's suit." Nevertheless, Hiss had Marbury send the papers to the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a>, clearly expecting Justice to indict Chambers. Instead, after days of intense grand jury hearings, Justice indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury on December 15, 1948. The libel suit stalled. When Hiss was convicted of both counts of perjury in January 1950, the libel suit disappeared. (Hiss maintained his innocence until his death in 1996.)

Years later, Marbury was critical of Hiss. After reviewing his HUAC testimony, he noted: There was no doubt that in his appearances before the Committee in my absence Alger had handled himself very badly. He had adopted a rather arrogant attitude and had repeatedly fenced with the members of the Committee. He had written a letter to the Chairman which reeked with hurt pride and indignation, and had grudgingly admitted association with Chambers under the name of George Crosley, but only after examining his teeth and asking him to read aloud some passages from a document.

Personal and death.
On December 3, 1935, Marbury married Natalie Ingraham Jewett (a <a href="Bryn%20Mawr">Bryn Mawr</a> graduate, previously married to Charles Yandes Wheeler, who died in 1933 in car accident; she died in 1993). He had two daughters, a son, and a stepson.

Marbury associated with the <a href="Peabody%20Institute">Peabody Institute</a> of Baltimore most of his life. He served as trustee (1935-1967), as president (1948-1957), and chairman (1957-1967).

He also served as a member of: 

In 1952, the "Harvard Crimson" noted that <a href="Whittaker%20Chambers">Whittaker Chambers</a> had written in the "<a href="Saturday%20Evening%20Post">Saturday Evening Post</a>" (which was serializing his memoir, "Witness") that "Marbury, a prominent Baltimore lawyer, supported Hiss because the charges against Hiss represented an attack against 'the island of caste'."

Marbury died age 86 on March 5, 1988, at his home in Baltimore.


Legacy.
In addition to his writings, Marbury left many of his papers to the Maryland Historical Society.

In 1987, the Harvard Corporation's president, <a href="Nathan%20M.%20Pusey">Nathan M. Pusey</a>, called Marbury "one of the great heroes of the Corporation."

Shortly after his death 1988, the <a href="Maryland%20Legal%20Services%20Corporation">Maryland Legal Services Corporation</a> named a "William L. Marbury Outstanding Advocate Award."

In 2005, the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> dedicated the offices of DLA Piper to the Marbury's memory.

DLA Piper established a "Marbury Institute" to train lawyers in house.

Still, as the Maryland Bar Journal noted in 2016: For one-half of a century a long line of Baltimore’s best barristers – <a href="John%20Prentiss%20Poe">John Prentiss Poe</a>, William L. Marbury Sr., <a href="W.%20Cabell%20Bruce">W. Cabell Bruce</a>, <a href="James%20H.%20Preston">James H. Preston</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Lobe%20Straus">Isaac Lobe Straus</a>, <a href="Philip%20B.%20Perlman">Philip B. Perlman</a>, and William L. Marbury Jr. – imposed <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a> laws and practices on black Baltimoreans from the "top-down."

Stanmore, Winchester

Stanmore is a large residential suburb of <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, England, situated on a very steep slope from West to East. It lies to the south-west of the city centre and to the north of <a href="Badger%20Farm">Badger Farm</a>, and makes up a large percentage, in both area and population, of the St. Luke <a href="electoral%20ward">electoral ward</a>.

History.
Historically the area was known as Stanmer Weye, before construction of the estate started in 1920. An official opening by <a href="George%20V">George V</a>, then the Prince of Wales, was carried out in 1923. 

Description.
Stanmore is a typical early 1900's housing estate, with medium-sized red brick houses and numerous green spaces, however there are also a number of newer developments, especially around the area informally known as Lower Stanmore.

The <a href="Right%20to%20Buy">Right to Buy</a> scheme has enabled a large amount of properties in Stanmore to come into private ownership, and this has seen the student population increase significantly. This is also due to Stanmore's close proximity to the <a href="University%20of%20Winchester">University of Winchester</a>.

Amenities.
The suburb formerly had two pubs, 'The Stanmore Hotel' (closed 2009) and 'New Queens Head' (closed 2012), with the former becoming a care home, and the latter being redeveloped into social housing. There are two local retail areas in Stanmore, in Wavell Way and Cromwell Road respectively. There is also a community centre on Somers Close.

Religion.
Stanmore is home to two religious institutions, St Luke's Church of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> on Mildmay Street, and Level10 church on Stanmore Lane.

Arbor (installation)

Arbor is a 2013 permanent <a href="Installation%20art">art installation</a> created by artist Adam Frank, commissioned for <a href="Sidney%20and%20Lois%20Eskenazi%20Hospital">Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital</a>, near downtown <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, and is part of the <a href="Eskenazi%20Health%20Art%20Collection">Eskenazi Health Art Collection</a>.

Description.
"Arbor" is a 2013 permanent <a href="Installation%20art">art installation</a> created by artist Adam Frank inside <a href="Sidney%20and%20Lois%20Eskenazi%20Hospital">Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital</a>. Utilizing new lighting technologies, this eight-part work displays visually accurate shadows of Indiana native trees via recessed floor-to-ceiling light boxes in the green elevator bays of the hospital on levels 1-3 and 6-10.  Of the work’s intention and purpose, Frank said, “"Arbor" provides the hospital with an iconic, quiet work that symbolizes health and life. This work brings familiar, organic, natural lighting effects into what is normally a cold and sterile environment.  Arbor brings natural lighting effects into the modern built environment in an entirely new way. The project is specifically meant to enhance how hospital patients, families and staff feel about the space they occupy.”

The feature walls showcase new, patent-pending technology, in which detailed 3D models are vertically sliced, each segment then rendered onto translucent glass and arranged at differing depths. An LED back light passes through the layers of glass and onto the back surface of <a href="Glass%20etching">etched glass</a>, resulting in highly detailed images close to the viewer and blurred images as the image recedes, creating the effect of both shadows and three dimensions.

Each floor’s tree is unique and acts as a floor identifier and way-finding symbol:

Kingdom of Larantuka

The Kingdom of Larantuka was a kingdom in present-day <a href="East%20Nusa%20Tenggara">East Nusa Tenggara</a>, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. It was the one of the few, if not the only, indigenous <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> polities in the territory of modern <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. Acting as a tributary of the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Crown</a>, the "Raja" (King) of Larantuka controlled holdings on the islands of <a href="Flores">Flores</a>, <a href="Solor">Solor</a>, <a href="Adonara">Adonara</a> and <a href="Lembata">Lembata</a>. It was later purchased by <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> from the Portuguese, prior to its annexation in 1904.

Despite losing its effective sovereignty after the annexation, the Kingdom's royal family persisted as traditional figureheads prior to the final abolishment of the royal structure by <a href="Indonesia">republican</a> authorities in 1962.

History.
Monarchs of the Larantuka Kingdom claim descent from an union between a man from the Kingdom of "Wehale Waiwuku" in South Timor and a mythical woman from a nearby extinct volcano of <a href="Ile%20Mandiri">Ile Mandiri</a>. Traditional belief systems and rituals of the <a href="Lamaholot%20people">Lamaholot people</a> who were their subjects place the "rajas" in a central role, especially for those who adhered to traditional beliefs.

In the Javanese "<a href="Negarakertagama">Negarakertagama</a>", the locations "Galiyao" and "Solot" were mentioned to be "east of <a href="Bali">Bali</a>" and are believed to correspond to the approximate region, indicating some form of contact from tributary relations or trading between the region and the <a href="Majapahit%20Empire">Majapahit Empire</a>, due to its location in the trade routes carrying <a href="sandalwood">sandalwood</a> from nearby <a href="Timor">Timor</a>. Influences from the powerful <a href="Ternate%20Sultanate">Ternate Sultanate</a> were also believed to be present.

Western presence in the region started with the Portuguese, who <a href="Capture%20of%20Malacca%20%281511%29">captured</a> <a href="Malacca">Malacca</a> in 1511. As they began trading for the <a href="sandalwood">sandalwood</a> at Timor, their presence in the region increased. <a href="Solor">Solor</a> was described by <a href="Tom%C3%A9%20Pires">Tomé Pires</a> in his "Suma Oriental", although some scholars believe he was referring to nearby larger <a href="Flores">Flores</a>, mentioning abundance of exported sulphur and foodstuffs. By 1515, there was trade between both <a href="Flores">Flores</a> and <a href="Solor">Solor</a> with the foreigners, and by 1520 a small Portuguese settlement has been constructed in Lifau, at Solor. The trade in sandalwood also attracted <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Chinese</a> and <a href="VOC">Dutch</a> along with nearer <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Gowa">Makassarese</a>, creating competition. The Makassarese attacked and captured Larantuka in 1541 to extend their control over the sandalwood trade and in 1613, the Dutch destroyed the Portuguese base at Solor before establishing themselves at modern <a href="Kupang">Kupang</a>.
The first "Raja" to be baptized was "Ola Adobala" who was brought up under Portuguese education, traditionally the ninth in the pedigree of the Rajas and baptized during the reign of <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Portugal">Peter II of Portugal</a> while present-day traditional celebrations place his baptism at 1650 instead. In addition, Portuguese sources mention a "Dom Constantino" between 1625-1661, which implies that Adobala may not be the first in the line of Catholic monarchs of Larantuka. Other monarch names mentioned are Dom Luis (1675) and Dom Domingos Viera (1702) The <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican Order</a> was vital in the spread of Catholicism in the area until their later replacement in the 19th century.

The polity maintained some form of a closed-port policy for outsiders in the late 17th century. There were also some interactions with nearby <a href="Islam">Islam</a> <a href="Bima%20Sultanate">Bima Sultanate</a>, whose Sultan enforced his suzerainty over parts of Western Flores in 1685. Territories of the kingdom were not contiguous, and was interspersed by the holdings of several lesser polities. Some Muslim.

By 1851, debts incurred by the Portuguese colony in <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> motivated the Portuguese authorities to "sell" territories covered by Larantuka to the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, and the transfer was made by 1859 ceding the Portuguese claim/suzerainty over parts of Flores and the island range stretching from <a href="Alor%20Island">Alor</a> to <a href="Solor">Solor</a> for 200,000 <a href="Dutch%20guilder">florins</a> and some Dutch holdings in Timor. The treaty also confirmed that the <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> inhabitants of the region will remain so under the authority of <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and the Dutch authorities sent <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priests to the area.

On 14 September 1887 a new "Raja" Don Lorenzo Diaz Vieria Godinho ascended to the throne as Lorenzo II, who was educated by Jesuit priests. Showing clear traits of independence, he attempted to extract taxes from territories belonging to a nearby "Raja" of Sikka, led groups of men to intervene in local conflicts, and refused to conduct sacrifices in the manner his predecessors did for the non-Catholic natives. Eventually, colonial authorities responded by deposing and exiling him to <a href="Java">Java</a> on 1904, where he died six years later.

The royal family remained post-Indonesian independence as traditional figureheads with no legal authority, until their final abolishment on 1962.

Legacy.
In present-day Indonenesia, unique Catholic traditions close to <a href="Easter">Easter</a> days remain, locally known as the "<a href="Semana%20Santa">Semana Santa</a>". It involves a procession carrying statues of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> and <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a> (locally referred to as "Tuan Ana" and "Tuan Ma") to a local beach, then to Cathedral of the Queen of the Rosary, seat of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Larantuka">bishop</a>. The "raja" title is still held by descendants of the past kings (most recently by Don Andre III Marthinus DVG on 2016), although it is not associated with any secular authority. The residence ("istana") of the king still stands to this day.

According to the 2010 census, the majority of the population in the kingdom's former territories, and the <a href="East%20Nusa%20Tenggara">East Nusa Tenggara</a> province as a whole, remained Catholics.

<doc id="54952334" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54952334" title="Siege of Chandax">
Siege of Chandax

The Siege of Chandax was a siege carried out by <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> emperor <a href="Romanos%20II">Romanos II</a> () in an attempt to wrest the island of <a href="Crete">Crete</a> from control of Muslim pirates under the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Crete">Emirate of Crete</a>. The Siege was undertaken by the general <a href="Nicephorus%20Phocas">Nicephorus Phocas</a>, as well as a raid carried out by <a href="Nicephorus%20Pastilas">Nicephorus Pastilas</a>.

Background.
On the year 824, a group of Andalusian exiles landed on Crete and began its conquest against the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. Quickly after the Andalusian exiles declared victory against the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, they established a new independent state, the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Crete">Emirate of Crete</a>. From their base on Crete, the Muslims were able to execute numerous profitable and devastating raids in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. They also occupied several of the <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a> during these early years. Soon, emperor <a href="Michael%20II">Michael II</a> retook the <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a>. In the 930s and 940s, Cretan piracy reached its apex in southern Greece, Athos, and the western coasts of Asia Minor. As a result, Emperor <a href="Constantine%20VII">Constantine VII</a> sent another expedition to Crete in 949, which failed, and another one during the last years of his reign. It would be carried out under his successor <a href="Romanos%20II">Romanos II</a>, who sent a huge fleet and army with <a href="Nikephoros%20Phokas">Nikephoros Phokas</a>, general of the east and future emperor, at the head of the expedition.

Pastilas' Raid.
Soon after the Byzantine army landed on Crete and defeated the defending armies, Nicephorus Phocas set up camp around the main fortress of the island, Chandax (modern <a href="Heraklion">Heraklion</a>). He soon instructed the general <a href="Nicephorus%20Pastilas">Nicephorus Pastilas</a> to undertake a raid into the Cretan countryside in order to procure extra provisions for the army and in order to scout out any relieving forces for the city or other approaching armies. Perceiving the countryside to be relatively safe, Pastilas roamed carelessly, indulging on food and wine. The company was soon ambushed and annihilated by Muslim forces. Pastilas himself was killed, and only a few soldiers returned to Chandax to spread the news of the massacre.

Phocas' Counterattack.
After hearing of the news of his slaughtered battalion, Phocas realized he would have to eliminate the relief force before sieging Chandax itself. If he did not he faced the problem of having to fight his battles on two fronts: one against the relief force, and one against the Chandax garrison. So it was that he handpicked a squadron of soldiers who would accompany him on a preemptive attack on the relief force. He set out and set upon engaging the Muslims at night. Through this tactic he was able to rout and destroy most of the relief force. With the threat of the major Muslim army now eliminated, Phocas could turn his attention toward Chandax, which he began to siege on his return.

Siege of Chandax.
The siegebegan upon Phocas' return from his raid. Phocas made sure to use the severed heads of many of his Muslim victims to attempt to demoralize the defenders. Phocas employed archers and throwing machines against the defenders while attempting to scale the wall using ladders. The fortress held, however, under the pressure of the bombardments, and the ladders were crushed. Phocas soon called off the siege. He now decided to blockade the city for the winter while his engineers began to design and construct more significant siege engines.
The second assault on Chandax took place in March 961. This time the Byzantines used much more effective siege machines against Chandax, but they were still unable to gain a foothold in the city. Meanwhile, the Muslims kept just out of range of the Greek archers so that they could still attend the walls but not be annihilated by the bombardment. Phocas soon employed the use of a battering ram on the walls, but this was a feint. While the Muslims were focusing on the battering ram, miners dug underneath the walls and planted explosive and flammable materials underneath the weak points. Soon, they managed to destroy a huge section of the wall, where the Byzantine army began to pour into the city. The defenders quickly formed a line within the city, but it was too late. The Muslims were soon routed and fled back into the streets. The soldiers were allowed the traditional three days of plunder before the army again set off.

Aftermath.
Following the capture of Chandax the Byzantine army was quickly able to conquer the rest of Crete. Lying on the outskirts of the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>, the conquest of Crete was especially beneficial to the Byzantines due to its strategical position for the purpose of launching raids onto the coast of <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, an endeavor frequently exploited by the Muslim <a href="Emirate%20of%20Crete">Emirate of Crete</a>, which embarked on devastating raids on the surrounding Aegean Islands.

As a solo artist it was hard, due to the fact that everybody knew him as a bass player, and nobody knew he composed songs on the guitar. It was a hard path at the beginning, but little by little he started recording his own songs, my first single was “Antro de Rutina” in 2009; for its release he organized a student contest in which the winner got a prize of $300.00 for the making of its video, because of this video, the concept of making an animated series called “Un Rasta Astronauta y Los Perturbadores Cósmicos (An Astronaut Rasta and The Cosmic Disturbers)” was made. The singles that followed were “Rockero de Acero (Steel Rocker)”, “No lo puedo evitar (Can’t Help It)”, “Para qué? (What for?)” and others, single by single.

He started working in a non profit foundation, promoting my songs in the media, until I started working with North American band promoters, like Skid Row, among others.

In 2014, he started touring South America, visiting more than 50 cities in Colombia, Ecuador, Perú, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, promoting these singles, with the goal of recording a new album, but in the middle of my recording sessions, I decided to release the single “Anochecer (twilight)” recorded in Bocas del Toro, Panama, with which I had the chance to promote it with a small tour through Germany, Amsterdam in 2015, and Austria in 2016.

Session Cases

Session Cases are the authoritative law reports of cases heard in the Scottish courts. They are now published by the Scottish Council of Law Reporting (SCLR), a charity established by the legal profession in Scotland with the prime purpose of publishing what are the nearest thing to 'official' law reports that exist in Scotland, as evidenced by Practice Notes from both the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary directing that Session Cases law reports must be cited in preference to any other source if the case being cited is reported in Session Cases.

The series commenced in 1821. Initially the law reports were of cases heard in the Court of Session only and were named for the editors who managed the collection of law reports thus Shaw (1821-37), Dunlop (1838-61), Macpherson (1862-72), Rettie (1873-97) and Fraser (1898-1905). There is no Session Cases volume numbered for 1906 and the series recommenced, as Session Cases, wth different annual coverage with the 1907 volume. The series has covered cases heard in the High Court of Justiciary, Scotland's supreme criminal court since the beginning of the Rettie series in 1873.

The series now reports cases heard in all the superior courts hearing Scottish cases: The United Kingdom Supreme Court (formerly the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords); the Privy Council; the High Court of Justiciary; the Court of Session (both Inner and Outer Houses); and, since 2016, the Sheriff Appeal Court (both criminal and civil appeals).

The SCLR has digitised all the cases reported in Session Cases from 1821 and the digital form of these reports is available from the commercial law reporting services offered by Justis, Lexis and Westlaw. Current law reports published in Session Cases are available in hard copy from the SCLR itself and in digital form on these three commercial services.

Uniquely in Scotland, all the law reports published in Session Cases are prepared by practising advocates or solicitor advocates who have rights of audience in the Scottish courts whose cases they report.

Sēlpils Castle

Sēlpils Castle () is an ancient castle in <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a>. It was known as Castrum Selonum in Latin. It was built in place of an ancient <a href="Selonia">Selonia</a>n <a href="hillfort">hillfort</a> (Sēlpils hillfort, ), a military and political center of ancient <a href="Selonia">Selonia</a>, a land of the <a href="Balts">Balts</a>. When the <a href="Livonian%20Order">Livonian Order</a> entered the land, they built a stone castle known as Selburg in German.

Today a village of <a href="Vecs%C4%93lpils">Vecsēlpils</a> ("old Sēlpils") ins located nearby. The ruins of the hillfort were on the left bank of <a href="Daugava%20River">Daugava</a> near Vecsēlpils. After the construction of <a href="P%C4%BCavi%C5%86as%20Hydroelectric%20Power%20Station">Pļaviņas Hydroelectric Power Station</a> and reservoir, the ruins are on an island.

Archaeological evidence shows that Sēlpils, 17 km northwest of modern <a href="J%C4%93kabpils">Jēkabpils</a>, was a major settlement between the 10th and 13th centuries. Used as a base for raids by the Selonians and their <a href="Lithuanians">Lithuanian</a> allies into <a href="Latgalians">Latgalian</a> and <a href="Livonians">Livonian</a> lands, Sēlpils was first mentioned in the <a href="Chronicle%20of%20Henry%20of%20Livonia">Chronicle of Henry of Livonia</a>, which describes its capture by the <a href="Livonian%20Brothers%20of%20the%20Sword">Livonian Order</a> and their <a href="Christianity">Christianized</a> ethnic Livonian allies in 1208. Sēlpils was briefly the seat of a Selonian <a href="diocese">diocese</a> (1218–1226), and then came under the rule of the Livonian Order, which constructed fortifications there for the Advocate () of the Order. These were destroyed by the <a href="Sweden">Swedes</a> in 1704, during the <a href="Great%20Northern%20War">Great Northern War</a>, and only traces of the foundations are visible at the site today.

Since early 17th century, the ancient city of Sēlpils also existed. The importance of Sēlpils as a trading center on the Daugava declined after the military devastation of the early 18th century.

Manhès-David process

The Manhès-David process is a <a href="Refining%20%28metallurgy%29">refining</a> process of the copper <a href="Matte%20%28metallurgy%29">mattes</a>, invented in 1880 by the French industrialist <a href="Pierre%20Manh%C3%A8s">Pierre Manhès</a> and his engineer . Inspired by the <a href="Bessemer%20process">Bessemer process</a>, it consists of the use of a converter to <a href="Redox">oxidise</a> with air the undesirable chemical elements (mainly <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>) contained in the matte, to transform it into copper.

The quantity of the elements to be oxidized, as well as the low <a href="Exothermic%20reaction">heat produced by the chemical reactions</a>, lead to drastics modifications of the converter. Manhès and David designed it as a horizontal cylinder, with nozzles aligned from one end to the other. A few years later, the Americans engineers <a href="William%20H.%20Peirce">William H. Peirce</a> and <a href="Elias%20Anton%20Cappelen%20Smith">Elias Anton Cappelen Smith</a> lined it with basic refractory materials, much more durable than that used by the French inventors. While this improvement does not alter the principles of the process, it eases its widespread use, accelerating the switchover of copper production from the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

At the beginning of the 21st century, the refines 90 % of the copper mattes and is used in 60 % of the <a href="nickel">nickel</a> extracted. This converter, like the addition of pure oxygen, the automation of the running, the treatment of smoke and the increasing size of the tools ensured the durability of the Manhès-David process, even if modern tools have little relationship with their ancestors.

Converting in copper metallurgy.
A mixture of copper and iron <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a>s referred to as <a href="Matte%20%28metallurgy%29">matte</a> is treated in converters to oxidize iron in the first stage, and oxidize copper in the second stage. In the first stage oxygen enriched air is blown through the <a href="tuyere">tuyere</a>s to partially convert metal sulfides to oxides:

Since iron has greater affinity to oxygen, the produced copper oxide reacts with the remaining iron sulfide:

The bulk of the copper oxide is turned back into the form of sulfide. In order to separate the obtained iron oxide, <a href="flux%20%28metallurgy%29">flux</a> (mainly silica) is added into the converter. Silica reacts with iron oxide to produce a light <a href="slag">slag</a> phase, which is poured off through the hood when the converter is tilted around the rotation axis:

After the first portion of slag is poured off the converter, a new portion of matte is added, and the converting operation is repeated many times until the converter is filled with the purified copper sulfide. The converter slag is usually recycled to the smelting stage due to the high content of copper in this by-product. Converter gas contains more than 10% of sulfur dioxide, which is usually captured for the production of <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>.

The second stage of converting is aimed at oxidizing the copper sulfide phase (purified in the first stage), and produces "blister copper". The following reaction takes place in the converter:

Copper content in the obtained blister copper is typically more than 95%. Blister copper is the final product of converting.

<doc id="54952806" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54952806" title="Sybel-Ficker controversy">
Sybel-Ficker controversy

The Sybel-Ficker controversy is the name given to a dispute in the second half of the 19th century between the historians <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Sybel">Heinrich von Sybel</a> (1817–1895) and <a href="Julius%20von%20Ficker">Julius von Ficker</a> (1826–1902). It involved a discussion concerning relations between Rome (that is, the <a href="Holy%20See">papal see</a>) and the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, which also had an important bearing on the <a href="Austria%E2%80%93Prussia%20rivalry">Austria–Prussia rivalry</a>—whether Austria was to be part of a federal Germany, or whether Germany would continue without Austria (as a <a href="Lesser%20Germany">Lesser Germany</a>). 

Heinrich von Sybel fired the first shot in the dispute in an 1859 lecture, in which he condemned the medieval politics of the German Empire as "unnational". Julius Ficker countered in 1861 in lectures at the <a href="University%20of%20Innsbruck">University of Innsbruck</a>, in which he justified the emperors' national politics, which he also presented as universal. While Sybel's was a "kleindeutsch-norddeutsch-protestantische" (<a href="Kleindeutschland">Little German</a>-North German-Protestant) concept of history, Ficker promoted a <a href="Greater%20Germany">Greater Germany</a> which would include Austria.

Background.
The controversy's roots are in the <a href="Austria%E2%80%93Prussia%20rivalry">Austria–Prussia rivalry</a> which had grown more intense in the 18th century. Prussia, under Frederick the Great, had emerged as a major European power, and Sybel finds cause for the dispute in early 19th-century Prussian historiography. It continues with the <a href="founding%20of%20the%20German%20Empire">founding of the German Empire</a> under Bismarck in 1871, which had become possible with the Prussian victory over Austria in the <a href="Austro-Prussian%20War">Austro-Prussian War</a> of 1866. Historians have argued that it continued into the 20th century, with Hitler's "<a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>" of 1938 as one high point. 

The disagreement over the politics of the medieval Empire was important because those should determine the political direction and the national identity of the first national German state. Comments by <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Giesebrecht">Friedrich Wilhelm von Giesebrecht</a>, who like Sybel was a student of <a href="Leopold%20von%20Ranke">Leopold von Ranke</a>, provoked Sybel into taking a public position. In his "Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit" (1855–1888), Giesebrecht wrote: "Moreover, the period of the Empire is the era whan our people, strengthened through unity, had risen to a position of power where it could not only freely determine its own fate, but could also commandeer other peoples, and where the German man exercised his greatest power in the world and the German name had the richest sound". Sybel countered that throughout the period of the Empire, starting with <a href="Otto%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, "national" interests had been betrayed while the Empire pursued interests in Italy, that its interest in the affairs of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%28Holy%20Roman%20Empire%29">Kingdom of Italy</a> had led only to meaningless loss of life. This was different, according to Sybel, under Otto's father, <a href="Henry%20the%20Fowler">Henry the Fowler</a>, but after him German politics were aimed in the wrong direction: "The powers of the nation, which at first and correctly following instinct had been directed toward the great colonization of the east, were afterwards aimed at an always alluring and always incorrect gleam of power south of the Alps.".

Cetina culture

Cetina culture is the name for the culture of the inhabitants of the Middle <a href="Dalmatian">Dalmatian</a> coast, and especially its hinterland, during the early <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, according to <a href="Paul%20Reineck">Paul Reineck</a>'s chronology Br A1-A2/B1 (2200 BC). It is a culture of the early Bronze Age (1900 to 1600 BC), named after numerous sites along the <a href="Cetina">Cetina</a> river, spread in the area of Central Dalmatia and <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>. Carriers of this culture were present in caves (Skarina samograd near Drniš, Gudnja near Ston, Ravlić cave in Drinovci) or in open settlements (Gradac in Kotorac and Krstina near Posušje). The graves are in rocky colonies. In the case of inhumation, they have the shape of a stone chest, while incinerating the remains of the deceased are laid in clay pots. 

Genesis.
Cetina culture emerged early in the early Bronze Age on the eneolite substrate (Adriatic culture); its carriers belong to the old Mediterranean population, which was partially Indoeuropeized but was not <a href="Indo-European">Indo-European</a>.

Area of diffusion.
The largest number of well known sites of Cetina culture is located in the interior of Dalmatia, primarily between the upper stream of the Cetina river and the lower <a href="Neretva">Neretva</a> river. Individual finds are documented on Central Dalmatian islands, <a href="Palagruz">Palagruz</a>, Northern Adriatic, deep in the interior of the Western <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="Southern%20Italy">Southern Italy</a>, and <a href="Greece">Greece</a>.

Settlements.
Settlements are the least known aspect of Cetina culture. The most significant deposits of Cetina culture were discovered only in the Škarin samograd (approx. 1.3m) cave located at the foot of the Mogli brdo, six kilometers northwest of Unešić. The amount of findings collected in other researched settlements, mostly caves, suggests mainly temporary or temporary stay, and sometimes only contact with the domicile population. The Stratigraphy of Scary Samogar has enabled Ivan Marovic and Borivoj Covic to produce a three-phase periodization of Cetina culture, which has been held in use until today. 

Funeral habits.
The caretakers of Cetina culture were burial of dead absenteeism (inhumation, incineration) in the tumulus most often made of large crushed stone, and only of a small stone or mixture of stone and earth. The deceased were laid in a crashed position in a stone chest or their burned remains stored in a clay jar usually placed in the center of the tumuli. In both ways of burial, a number of fragments (from two to even 67) of pottery vessels were discovered in stone tumbling, and it may be that the traces of ritual breaking of the pots used during the aftertaste. In addition to the only inhumation or burning necropolis, there are also those in which both funeral rituals were applied. Attacks in graves are very rare, and most often, they are bronze weapons or jewelery. The ceramics found in the funeral context are generally much poorer than those of the settlement.

Monastery Agios Dionysios

The two monasteries named Agios Dionysios (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> Αγιός Διονύσιος) are located in Greece at <a href="Mount%20Olympos">Mount Olympos</a>.

Location.
The older of the two monasteries is located at the Enipeas ravine at an altitude of 850 m. The newer monastery is about three kilometers outside of <a href="Litochoro">Litochoro</a>.

Name.
Originally the name of the ancient monastery was Agia Triada, <a href="Holy%20Trinity">Holy Trinity</a>, (Greek Αγία Τριάδα). In the course of time, however, the name of its founder, Saint Dionysius, has prevailed. The new monastery was named directly after Saint Dionysius.

History (old and new monastery).
In 1542 it was founded by Saint Dionysius and devoted to the Holy Trinity. Surrounded by strong high walls and towered by a watchtower, it resembles a small fortress. During various conflicts it served as a shelter for civilians, but also for fighting troops. Today the visitor can see a ruin from the outside. In its history the monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. In 1821 <a href="Veli%20Pasha">Veli Pasha</a> burnt it down. The last destructive blow, however, brought him the German Wehrmacht in April 1943. Since Greek freedom fighters should have retreated in the monastery, it was first bombed and later blasted.

The monks then left the destroyed monastery and moved into the <a href="Metochion">Metochion</a>, the estate of the monastery. The Metochion was founded in 1650 and consisted, apart from the lands, of a church, the economic buildings and another building in which the monks lived, who took care of the farm. After the Second World War, this estate was gradually expanded into a monastery. The older part of the new monastery is equipped with a heavy iron door and thus separated from the rest of the system. Access to this area, called Abaton, is only permitted for men. Here you will find the old church, the cells of the monks, the refectory and the administrative building. Just outside are the stables, workshops and the cheese factory. All other buildings, outside the Abaton, such as the new church or the museum, were built after 1985.

The Agios Dionysios Monastery is a <a href="stauropegic">stauropegic</a> monastery, subordinated directly to the <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch of Constantinople</a> (Istanbul).

The church.
It was built in classical orthodox style. An image of Saint Dionysius adorns the entrance. Inside, in addition to the usual sumptuous decor of an Orthodox church, there are some special features. It is striking that many chairs, standing consoles and other items are decorated with <a href="marquetry">marquetry</a>. The inserts are made of ivory or mother-of-pearl. On a small table stands an icon depicting the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Next to it is a little basket with notes and ball-point pens. Believers who want to make a request to the saint can put it here on paper.

The museum (New monastery).
To the west of the complex is the museum. In troubled times, of which the old monastery lived some, monks were hiding the monastic treasures in secret vaults. A selection of rescued exhibits:


Quite inconspicuous, but significant, some framed black-and-white photographs hang near the entrance. They show the old monastery in the mountains just before its destruction. A soldier of the Wehrmacht made these pictures secretly and sent them to the monastery a few years ago.

The chapel of Saint Dionysios.
Twenty minutes' walk from the old monastery is the chapel of Saint Dionysius. It is located at the Enipeas River in a southeastern direction from the monastery. Who from Litochoro ascends to Prionia comes necessarily by the chapel. It is built under an overhanging rock, just above a spring. It consists of a small devotional space where the saint celebrated the sacred liturgy during his time as a hermit. A small shed served him as a sleeping place.

The South Asia Inscriptions Database

The South Asia Inscriptions Database or, by its shorter name, SIDDHAṂ, is an open-access resource for the study of inscriptions from South, Central and South East Asia. SIDDHAṂ was established by the <a href="European%20Research%20Council">European Research Council</a> with start-up funding from the project . The first focus of SIDDHAṂ is <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <a href="epigraphy">epigraphy</a>, mainly of the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries CE, but the platform is designed to accommodate inscriptions from all periods. In South Asia alone, the estimated number of historic inscriptions is 90,000. In its next phases, SIDDHAṂ will expand to include inscriptions in <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>, <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a>, <a href="Prakrit">Prakrit</a>, <a href="Classical%20Tibetan">Tibetan</a>, <a href="Burmese%20language">Burmese</a>, <a href="Pyu%20language%20%28Burma%29">Pyu</a> and <a href="Mon%20language">Mon</a>. 

The Name.
In <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "siddham" means "accomplished, perfected." This word, written out in characters (such as those shown in the SIDDHAṂ logo above) or represented by a symbol, very often stands at the beginning of inscriptions in Indic languages. Part of the word, SID, is also an acronym for South Asia Inscriptions Database. Incidentally, the term is also commonly used as a short name for the Indian script more properly known as <a href="Siddha%E1%B9%83_script">siddhamātṛkā</a>.
Technical background.
The records in SIDDHAṂ have been prepared in <a href="EpiDoc">EpiDoc</a>, a tool for structured <a href="markup%20language">markup</a> of <a href="epigraphy">epigraphic</a> documents in <a href="Text%20Encoding%20Initiative">TEI</a> <a href="XML">XML</a>. 
Numbering system.
Within SIDDHAṂ, each item is listed firstly as an object -- such as a pillar, sculpture, copper-plate, stone slab and so forth. Each object may carry one or more inscriptions, thus each inscription has been assigned a separate SIDDHAṂ number. A good example is the <a href="Allahabad%20pillar">Allahabad pillar</a> -- a single object -- which carries many inscriptions, among them those of Aśoka, <a href="Samudragupta">Samudragupta</a> and Jahāngīr. The inscription of Samdragupta appears in SIDDHAṂ as IN00001. All material generated for SIDDHAṂ is archived in <a href="Zenodo">Zenodo</a>.

The further example illustrated here is from <a href="Salihundam">Salihundam</a>, Gara Mandal, Srikakulam district, <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, India, a Buddhist place located approximately at 18°20'7"N 84°2'28"E. At this site, a series of five votive inscriptions are engraved on the semi-circular threshold of a ruined shrine. In SIDDHAṂ, the semi-circular stone will carry an object number and each votive record an independent inscription number. The photograph of the inscriptions is archived as Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.557032.

A specialist stayer who was favoured by <a href="Going%20%28horse%20racing%29">soft ground</a> she won five of her seventeen races in a track career which lasted from September 2011 until May 2014. She failed to win as a two-year-old but made steady improvement when tried over long distance in the following year, winning three races including the two-mile Irish Cesarewitch (by ten <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a>). She continued to improve as a four-year-old, winning the <a href="Vintage%20Crop%20Stakes">Vintage Crop Stakes</a> and recording her biggest win in the <a href="Irish%20St%20Leger">Irish St Leger</a>. She was then sold to race in Australia where she failed to win in four races.

Background.
Voleuse de Coeurs is a bay mare with a large white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">star</a> bred by the <a href="Irish%20National%20Stud">Irish National Stud</a>. As a <a href="yearling%20%28horse%29">yearling</a> she was put up for auction at the Goffs Sale and was bought for €30,000 by Skymarc Farm Inc. She entered the ownership of <a href="Lady%20O%27Reilly">Lady O'Reilly</a> and was sent into training with <a href="Dermot%20Weld">Dermot Weld</a> at the <a href="Curragh">Curragh</a>, <a href="County%20Kildare">County Kildare</a>.

She was from the first crop of foals sired by <a href="Teofilo">Teofilo</a> the undefeated <a href="Cartier%20Champion%20Two-year-old%20Colt">European Champion Two-Year-Old</a> of 2006.

Her dam Vadorga showed no racing ability, finishing unplaced in all three of her races as a three-year-old in France in 2005. She was, however, a full sister to <a href="Vahorimix">Vahorimix</a> (winner of the <a href="Poule%20d%27Essai%20des%20Poulains">Poule d'Essai des Poulains</a>) and was closely related to <a href="Valixir">Valixir</a>, <a href="Val%20Royal">Val Royal</a> and <a href="Valyra%20%28horse%29">Valyra</a>.

The mare's name is <a href="French%20language">French</a> for "Thief of Hearts".

Racing career.
2011: two-year-old season.
On her racecourse debut, Voleuse de Coeurs finished third of the fifteen runners in a <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> over one mile at <a href="Gowran%20Park">Gowran Park</a> on 24 September. Eleven days later she started at odds of <a href="Fractional%20odds">5/2</a> for a similar event at <a href="Navan%20Racecourse">Navan Racecourse</a> and finished fifth, more than ten <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a> behind the <a href="Aiden%20O%27Brien">Aiden O'Brien</a>-trained favourite Kissed.

2012: three-year-old season.
Voleuse de Coeurs began her second season in a maiden over ten amd a half <a href="furlongs">furlongs</a> at <a href="Dundalk%20Racecourse">Dundalk Racecourse</a> in April in which she stayed on well in straight but was beaten a neck into second by the <a href="Colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> Ursa Major. On May 19 the filly started 13/8 favourite for a minor race over eleven and a half furlongs at <a href="Wexford%20Racecourse">Wexford Racecourse</a> and recorded her first succes as he took the lead two furlong from the finish and won by a length and a quarter from Zabana. Voleuse de Coeurs spent the rest of the season running in <a href="Handicap%20%28horse%20racing%29">handicap races</a>. Racing over middle ditances she finihed fourth to Ursa Major at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh</a> in June and fourth again to Beach of Falesa at Killarney on 15 July. When moved up in distance for a two miles at <a href="Galway%20Races">Galway Races</a> two weeks later she produced a marked improvement as she took the lead in the last quarter mile and drew away to win "easily" by eight lengths from the five-year-old Domination. 

Pat Smullen had ridden Voleuse de Coeurs in all her races up to this point but Leigh Roche took over the ride when the filly contested the Irish Cesarewitch over two miles on <a href="Going%20%28horse%20racing%29">heavy ground</a> at the Curragh on 14 October. Carrying 127 pounds, and starting 6/1 favourite in a 27-runner field, she only went to the front a furlong out but then rapidly pulled clear of her rivals to win by ten lengths. Dermot Weld's son and assistant Kris Weld commented "We thought she would win and that has been the plan since Galway. It was soft in Galway, but very different conditions today. It was real winter ground and I haven’t seen it as bad on the Curragh before. Leigh gave her a great ride and dad saw it live in Canada. She won like the decent filly she is. She’ll stay in training and hopefully she can pick up some <a href="Group%20races">black type</a> next year".

2013: four-year-old season.
In 2013 Voleuse de Coeurs made her seasonal debut in a minor race over one and a half miles at <a href="Limerick%20Racecourse">Limerick Racecourse</a> in April in which she finished second to El Salvador. On 19 May she was moved back up in distance for the Listed Vintage Crop Stakes over one and three quarter miles at Navan and started 7/4 second choice in the betting behind El Salvador with the best of the other runners appearing to be the high-class <a href="Hurdling%20%28horse%20race%29">hurdler</a> Steps To Freedom. Smullen restrained the filly in the early stages before moving up to take the lead a furlong out at which point Voleuse de Coeurs "forged clear" to win by two lengths from Missunited. Weld, who trained <a href="Vintage%20Crop">the horse after which the race was named</a>, said "I see her as being very progressive and possibly an outstanding stayer. I thought she would win and this is a race I wanted to win". The filly made her first appearance at Group level on 30 June in the <a href="Curragh%20Cup">Curragh Cup</a> for which she started favourite but came home third behind Ernest Hemingway and <a href="Royal%20Diamond">Royal Diamond</a>.

After a break of almost seven weeks, Voleuse de Coeurs faced Ernest Hemingway and Royal Diamond in the Irish St Leger Trial Stakes at the Curragh on 24 August. She raced in second place behind Royal Diamond for most of the way but was unable to overhaul the leader and finished runner-up, beaten half a length by the winner. <a href="Chris%20Hayes%20%28jockey%29">Chris Hayes</a> took the ride when Voleuse de Coeurs contested the Group 1 Irish St Leger at the Curragh on 15 September and started at odds of 9/1 in a ten-runner field. The British-trained <a href="gelding">gelding</a> Ahzeemah (winner of the <a href="Lonsdale%20Cup">Lonsdale Cup</a>) started favourite while the other runners included Royal Diamond, Ernest Hemingway, <a href="Red%20Cadeaux">Red Cadeaux</a>, Saddler's Rock (<a href="Goodwood%20Cup">Goodwood Cup</a>) and Pale Mimosa (<a href="Saval%20Beg%20Stakes">Saval Beg Stakes</a>). Royal Diamond took an early lead and set the pace with Voleuse de Coeurs settled in mid-division before making steady progress from half way. The filly took the lead three furlongs out and went clear of the field, winning by six lengths from Ahzeemah despite being eased down by Hayes in the final strides. Although Lady O'Reilly talked of retiring the filly, Dermot Weld said "She's a smart filly and a model of consistency," he said after the race. "She ran a cracking trial behind Royal Diamond and I knew she would improve for that. She's a joy to train and is very straightforward... I will try and encourage Lady O'Reilly to keep her in training as I think she will be a high-class Cup mare at five."

In October Voleuse de Coeurs was bought privately by an Australian-based group and was redirected to the <a href="Melbourne%20Cup">Melbourne Cup</a>. The Australian Mick Moroney immediately became her official trainer and she was sent into <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> for her journey to Melbourne. On 5 November at <a href="Flemington%20Racecourse">Flemington Racecourse</a> the filly started at odds of 17/1 for the Melbourne Cup and finished tenth of the 24 runners behind <a href="Fiorente">Fiorente</a>.

2014: five-year-old season.
Voleuse de Coeurs remained in training with Moroney in Australia for the first half of 2014. She made little impression in three starts against top-class opposition, finishing fifth in the <a href="Australian%20Cup">Australian Cup</a>, fifth in <a href="The%20BMW">The BMW</a> and twelfth in the <a href="Sydney%20Cup">Sydney Cup</a>.

HMS Wrangel

HMS Wrangel (25), formerly (9), was a <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Navy">Royal Swedish Navy</a>, built at Lindholm Shipyard in Gothenburg, and was launched on September 24, 1917 as the first of two destroyers of the <a href="Wrangel-class_destroyer">"Wrangel" class</a>. "Wrangel" was a sister ship to <a href="HSwMS%20Wachtmeister%20%2810%29">HSwMS "Wachtmeister"</a>. The ship class were among the most modern destroyers in the world just after the end of World War I. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939 she was stationed as part of the <a href="Gothenburg%20Squadron">Gothenburg Squadron</a>. "Wrangel" was decommissioned in 1947 and was subsequently used as a pilot and target vessel and sunk on Horsfjärden in 1960. The ship was named after <a href="Carl%20Gustaf%20Wrangel">Carl Gustaf Wrangel</a>.

Design.
"Wrangel"s hull was made of nitrated steel. Like former Swedish destroyers, the ship had no proper superstructure on the bow, but had only a protective skirt wall for the command bridge, though there was a small superstructure on the stern. The propulsion machinery consisted of four steam boilers which delivered steam to two steam turbines. The machine generated an output of 11,500 horsepower, giving a maximum speed of 34 knots. Each boiler had a separate funnel, which led to the common four stack arrangement of the time. The two steam turbines were of a new type with reduction gears, which meant that the turbine speed could be shifted down to lower the propeller speed, giving the machinery a better efficiency.

History.
"Wrangel" was built at Lindholm's Gothenburg shipyard and was launched on September 24, 1917. After fitting out and trials she was delivered to the Swedish Navy on May 4, 1918.

In 1923, Crown Prince Gustav Adolfs would be engaged to Louise Mountbatten with the engagement taking place in England. On 28 June, "Wrangel" went from <a href="Karlskrona">Karlskrona</a> together with her sister ship "Wachtmeister" and all three ships in the <a href="Sverige-class%20coastal%20defence%20ship">"Sverige"</a> class. On July 2 they went to <a href="Sheerness">Sheerness, England</a> where the couple visited the ships. A couple of days later, the journey proceeded to <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth, Scotland</a>, where they visited the English Atlantic fleet before going back to Sweden.

World War II.
In 1939, the ship was redeployed with a 25-mm anti-aircraft machine gun added, in addition to two depth charge positions with 16 charges. At the start of WWII "Wrangel" was positioned along with her sister ship in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>. In the winter of 1940-1941 the ship would receive new boilers, but by late autumn 1943 she was put into material reserve.

Fate.
After "Wrangel" was placed in reserve, she never would be reactivated and was released from service on June 13, 1947. Thereafter she was used as a pilot and target vessel and sank in <a href="H%C3%A5rsfj%C3%A4rden">Hårsfjärden</a> in 1960.

While Coate and Norman Tindale stated that the Yawijibaya were strictly islanders, Valda Blundell's informants claimed two Yawijibaya clans had mainland estates, while another two maintains their estates on the Montgomery and the High Cliffy islands. She also thought that the mainland norm of asymmetrical wife exchanges between tribes obtaining on the continent was not repeated among the Yawijibaya, who were said to maintain a restricted inter-island clan system of wife exchange. The evidence is difficult to evaluate, given it came not from living Yawijibaya, but informants from tribes where amalgamation of customs had already taken place for some considerable time.

Excavations on High Cliffy Island have uncovered extensive stone structures, some consisting of <a href="Dry%20stone">dry-stone formwork</a> only evidenced elsewhere on the other side of the continent at <a href="Condah">Lake Condah in Victoria</a>. The island lies east of the Montgomery group. It takes its name from the geophysical feature of steeply rising up cliffs to a height of some 15 metres. In addition, 3 rock shelters, and several work sites, high-quality quartz sandstone, <a href="chert">chert</a> and limestone quarries, dugong-butchering areas and places for working metal harpoons, were revealed. Given the presence of glassware, pottery and clay pipe material, it was suggested initially that the stone building might have been the handiwork of <a href="Makassan%20contact%20with%20Australia">Makassar traders</a>. The analysis concluded that the structures were of Aboriginal manufacture. One possibility is that they are the remains of monsoonal refuges, where the Yawijibaya could retire to, in order to escape the mosquitoe and <a href="sandfly">sandfly</a> infestations that would have plagued their low-lying mangrove-fringed islands as the rains set in.

The quarry works clearly have a trade purpose and are unique for the area and are unexampled on otherwise similar mainland locations, O'Connors argues:
large quantities of artefactual material found all over the High Cliffy Island testify to a level of stone working not seen in any of the mainland rockshelters and open sites.

Mythology.
Howard Coate suggested that the "rai" myths of a spirit-child, encountered widely in this region, and also among the island and coastal peoples (<a href="Baada">Baada</a>, <a href="Umiida">Umiida</a> and <a href="Unggaranggu">Unggaranggu</a>) contiguous with the Yawijibaya, formed part of Yawijibaya thinking. These properly refer to 'conception totems' ("raya").

According to one of their legends, the islands once formed a continuous landmass, which was destroyed when a tidal event washed over the area, leaving only islands in its wake.

History.
The missionary and expert on the <a href="Worrorra">Worrorra</a>, <a href="James%20Robert%20Beattie%20Love">J. R. B. Love</a> maintained that the Yawijibaya were being completely assimilated into the Worrorra people by the 1930s, as a clan of the latter's "Atpalar" moiety. Valda Blundell recorded that in the early 1970s there was still one very old Yawijibaya man from the Montgomery islands resident at the <a href="Lombadina%2C%20Western%20Australia">Lombidina mission</a>.

The von Brandenstein hypothesis.
In the sparse ethnographic literature, remarks are to be found to the effect that the Yawijibaya were physically quite dissimilar to other indigenous peoples of the region. J. R. B. Love stated that they were of 'men of a distinct physical type.' The Yawijibaya <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> figured as part of the key linguistic evidence which <a href="Carl%20Georg%20von%20Brandenstein">Carl Georg von Brandenstein</a> adduced in support of his claim that there was a secret <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese prehistory</a> of colonization of Australia, a theory he based on etymologies of words in East Kimberley <a href="toponym">place-names</a>. He argued that there were two <a href="Moiety%20%28kinship%29">moieties</a> on the Montgomery isles, the "Yawuji-Bara" and the "Yawuji-Baia". These, von Brandenstein thought, made sense once they were re-analysed as forms of a <a href="Portuguese-based%20creole%20languages">Portuguese creole</a> respectively going back to "avós-de-bara" ('ancestors of the bar/breakwater') and "avós de-baia" ('ancestors of the bay'). In von Brandenstein's imaginative reconstruction, it followed that the Yawijibaya were descendants of Portuguese African slaves who had persisted in speaking their <a href="Creole%20language">creole</a> long after their masters had forsaken the island, and this deeply affected the language that was spoken there.

Aside from the fact that no such tribal opposition has been attested in the ethnographical literature, the phonetic distinction it was based on probably did not exist, the first term simply representing a mishearing of the second, namely "yawiji-baya".

Anne Bonnie (comics)

Anne Bonnie is an <a href="American%20comic%20book">American comic book</a> created, written, and illustrated by Tim Yates. The first issue was published by <a href="Blue%20Juice%20Comics">Blue Juice Comics</a> on March 19, 2014. Additional issues have been published on an irregular schedule. In December 2015, the first six issues were collected into a <a href="trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">trade paperback</a>. Additional issues are scheduled for 2017.

The story is a fantasy adventure about Ariana, a young girl who steals a haunted ship to pursue her dream of being a pirate.

Publication history.
Tim Yates was a nursing student before switching career paths and enrolling at <a href="The%20Kubert%20School">The Kubert School</a>, where he befriended classmate Gavin Smith. When Smith was hired to illustrate "<a href="Accelerators%20%28comics%29">Accelerators</a>" for <a href="Blue%20Juice%20Comics">Blue Juice Comics</a> in 2011, he brought Yates along as his <a href="colorist">colorist</a>. While promoting "Accelerators" at the 2012 <a href="New%20York%20Comic%20Con">New York Comic Con</a>, Yates was sketching characters and concepts for "Anne Bonnie", a pirate adventure inspired by "<a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20%28film%20series%29">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>" and "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20%28franchise%29">Indiana Jones</a>". He was planning to pitch it to Blue Juice publisher Thomas Mumme as a new series, but Mumme approached Yates first to ask for a proposal.

Although "Anne Bonnie" is the first time Yates wrote or drew a comic, most of his previous story ideas had starred a female protagonist. When he began developing a pirate concept, including the historical <a href="Anne%20Bonny">Anne Bonny</a> was a "no-brainer" for him. He chose to use a fantasy setting to give himself more freedom in his storytelling.

When writing scripts for the story, Yates uses a loose scripting style that allows him to make changes as he's creating the artwork. He draws inspiration from <a href="anime">anime</a> and cartoons in his open and colorful line art, which contrasts with more common styles that utilize solid blacks. Once the art is finished, he refines the dialogue to remove redundant exposition and enhance humor.

The first issue of "Anne Bonnie" was released to <a href="Direct%20Market">comic specialty stores</a> through <a href="Diamond%20Comics%20Distribution">Diamond Comics Distribution</a> and digitally through <a href="Comixology">Comixology</a> on March 19, 2014. Diamond sold out of the approximately 3,500 <a href="print%20run">print run</a> within a week. It was the 352nd best selling single issue of the month. A second issue with a print run of about 1,800 copies was released in June, followed by a third issue in October. After a hiatus, the series returned for three more issues released on a quarterly schedule beginning in June 2015. These six issues were collected into a <a href="trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">single volume</a> with the subtitle "The Journey Begins" in December 2015.

A seventh issue was scheduled for release in July 2017.

Plot.
Ariana is an orphan who lives under the care of Lord Firestorm. He tries to teach her proper etiquette and manners, but she is more interested in the legend of Anne Bonnie, the Pirate Queen, and dreams of having her own adventures. As a teenager, she discovers the Crimson Dawn, an old pirate ship, beneath Lord Firestorm's castle and steals it. Because the ship is haunted, she is able to sail it by herself. In search of adventures, she quickly makes new friends and enemies.

Reception.
Noting that an early print run of the first issue sold out at <a href="comic%20conventions">comic conventions</a>, <a href="Bleeding%20Cool">Bleeding Cool</a> editor Hannah Means-Shannon called "Anne Bonnie" a "major success". A team of reviewers for Unwinnable appreciated the creative art design, but believed the story had <a href="Pace%20%28narrative%29">pacing</a> problems.
