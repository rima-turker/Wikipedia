<doc id="54854862" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54854862" title="Aulus Marius Celsus">
Aulus Marius Celsus

Aulus Marius Celsus was a <a href="Roman%20empire">Roman</a> <a href="Roman%20senate">senator</a> who held several offices in the emperor's service during the first century AD, as well as playing a role in the <a href="Year%20of%20Four%20Emperors">Year of Four Emperors</a>. He was <a href="Roman%20consul">suffect consul</a> of the "<a href="nundinium">nundinium</a>" of July-August 69 as the colleague of <a href="Gnaeus%20Arrius%20Antoninus">Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus</a>.

Life.
His career began under <a href="Nero">Nero</a>. Celsus was legate or commander of the <a href="Legio%20XV%20Apollinaris">Legio XV Apollinaris</a>, first in Pannonia , then in Asia Minor. Nero then designated Celsus together with Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus, to the consulship of the year 69, for the "nundinium" of July to September. 

After the suicide of Nero, Galba made him part of his inner circle; Celsus was present, along with <a href="Aulus%20Ducanus%20Geminus">Aulus Ducanus Geminus</a>, <a href="Urban%20prefect">Urban prefect</a>, when Galba announced Piso as his choice for his heir. Then Celsus was assigned to meet with the <a href="vexillatio">vexillatio</a>ns from the Illyrian legions camped in the "<a href="Porticus%20Vipsania">Porticus Vipsania</a>" and convince them to accept Galba's choice of heir; the soldiers drove him away at spear-point. After Galba's death, Celsus was in great danger of being killed by the soldiers for he had visibly shown his loyalty to Galba. <a href="Otho">Otho</a> saved him with cunning and took him into his own inner circle.

Upon hearing that <a href="Vitellius">Vitellius</a> was marching on Rome with the Rhine legions, Otho picked Celsus, along with <a href="Suetonius%20Paullinus">Suetonius Paullinus</a> and <a href="Appius%20Annius%20Gallus">Appius Annius Gallus</a> to lead the troops in Rome against them. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Locus%20Castorum">Battle of Locus Castorum</a>, where the two armies first met, Celsus commanded the cavalry, which was the first group to encounter the enemy.

Despite the Othonian victory at Locus Castorum, the decisive battle was still to come: <a href="Battle%20of%20Bedriacum">Bedriacum</a>. Celsus' military knowledge was esteemed enough that he was included in Otho's council prior to the battle; there he supported Suetonius' advice that the Othonian forces play for time so they could be joined by other units expected from the Illyrian provinces and the Danubean legions. However, Otho decided on engaging the opposing forces immediately. The two generals were reduced to members of <a href="Licinius%20Proculus">Licinius Proculus</a>'s staff, "advisers in name, in fact as scapegoats for any mishaps that occurred," as Gwyn Morgan pointed notes. This battle went against Otho. During the fighting Celsus had joined <a href="Titianus">Titianus</a>, and was with him when Titianus returned to their camp; Celsus called a meeting of the officers where he recommended surrender, and in the following morning accompanied Annius Gallus to the Vitellian camp to negotiate that surrender.

Some days later, when Vitellius had caught up with his soldiers and considered what to do with the surviving generals who had sided with Otho. Suetonius and Proculus claimed they had actually supported Vitellius, and had done everything they could to sabatoge Otho's military effectiveness, received his contempt. Otho's brother Titianus Vitellius pardoned because of his loyalty and incompetence. Only Marius came out of this well; Vitellius seems to have thought of him as an honorable man. The new emperor overlooked his earlier loyalties, and immediately took Celsus among his confidants. Celsus was allowed to keep the consulship that Otho had assigned him, although he lost one month from the promised "nundinium" so Vitellius could reward his supporters with suffect consulships.

Under Emperor <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>, Celsus served as govenor of the important imperial provinces of <a href="Germania%20Inferior">Germania Inferior</a> in 71-73, leading <a href="Ronald%20Syme">Ronald Syme</a> to make "the rational assumption that he terminated the <a href="Batavian%20Rebellion">Batavian Rebellion</a>." Whether this assumption is correct, it is clear that after his posting in Germany was concluded, Celsus was swiftly transferred to <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">Syria</a> (73-74). It is possible that Celsus died while governor of the latter province; <a href="Marcus%20Ulpius%20Traianus%20%28senior%29">Marcus Ulpius Traianus</a> is attested as governor there shortly after Celsus' arrival.

 Biography.
Ceh Moo was born in <a href="Calotmul%20Municipality">Calotmul</a> on May 12, 1968. Ceh Moo earned a degree in education from <a href="Universidad%20Aut%C3%B3noma%20de%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán</a> and a degree in law from the Universidad Aliat.

Ceh Moo uses tropes and literature types that she borrows from the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> and uses them in her native language.

Dominique Moreau is a <a href="France">French</a> entrepreneur and winemaker. She owns and operates Domaine Marie Courtin in <a href="Champagne%20%28province%29">Champagne, France</a> where she makes <a href="Biodynamic%20wine">biodynamic</a>, <a href="sparkling%20wine">sparkling wine</a>.

Domaine Marie Courtin.
Moreau purchased an estate in the village of <a href="Polisot">Polisot</a>, Côte des Bar, <a href="Champagne">Champagne</a> 2001. She named the Domaine after her grandmother, Marie Courtin, whom she describes as a “woman of the earth”. She began farming in 2001 and making wine in 2006.

Moreau founded the estate with an intent to produce a series of single-vineyard, single varietal, single vintage wines from Biodynamically-grown grapes. This philosophy is in contrast with traditional Champagne production, which emphasizes blending grapes, vineyards and vintages to create a consistent product.

Most of her wines come from a hillside vineyard which grows 40-45 year old massale-selection <a href="Pinot%20noir">Pinot Noir</a>. The combination of low yields, <a href="Limestone">clay-limestone</a> soils (with bands of <a href="Kimmeridgian%20soil">Kimmeridgian</a>) and an east/southeast exposure gives the wines both power and cut, with an intense brininess and minerality. Today, Moreau also grows <a href="Chardonnay">Chardonnay</a> and <a href="Pinot%20blanc">Pinot Blanc</a> grapes.

Moreau has been farming organically since the estate's origins in 2001, and the domaine received its Ecocertification in 2009. She picks by hand and crushes the grapes whole using a wood basket press. The juice is left to settle for 24 hours before the initial fermentation.

She uses a strain of indigenous yeast that was developed during the 2003 harvest from the vintage’s fruit. After an eight to ten day fermentation, the wines undergo full malolactic fermentation. The cuvees spend nine to twelve months in stainless steel tank or oak, are bottled and left on the lees for about two and a half years.

Riley (December 24, 1908-October 5, 1987) was an <a href="Apache">Apache</a> tribal council member who was instrumental in the economic development of the <a href="White%20Mountain%20Apache">White Mountain Apache</a> Tribe. She was the first woman to be elected to serve on the tribal council and worked toward bringing timber and tourism industries to the reservation to ensure their economic stability. She was inducted into the <a href="Arizona%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Arizona Women's Hall of Fame</a> posthumously in 1988.

Early life.
Mary Velasquez was born on December 24, 1908 at Fort Apache, on the <a href="Fort%20Apache%20Indian%20Reservation">White Mountain Apache Reservation</a> to Nalatzalay (Belle née Ivins) and Jesus Velasquez. Her father was born in <a href="Fort%20Davis%2C%20Texas">Fort Davis, Texas</a> to Mexican nationals from <a href="Coahuila">Coahuila</a>, Martín and Juana (née Rivers) Velasquez, and came to Fort Apache traveling with soldiers from Ft. Davis, as a child with his mother. He worked for a time as a translator and scout and then managed a ranch where he provided supplies to the soldiers at the fort. Her mother was a full-blood Apache and the daughter of Nadischaay. Velasquez and her siblings grew up on their father's farm, helping with farm chores. She attended three years of school, but was forced to leave in the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a> to help with sick relatives.

Though she was unable to return to school, Velasquez became fluent in three languages: <a href="Apache%20language">Apache</a>, Spanish, and English. She read newspapers widely. Velasquez first married Kurt Johnson and then around 1936, married Peter Kessay Riley, with whom she raised her five children, all of whom were also trilingual, and to whom she stressed the importance of gaining an education. She farmed as her father had, raising corn, potatoes, pumpkin and squash, as well as turkey, goat and sheep.

Tribal career.
In 1958, Riley became the first woman elected to serve on the White Mountain Apache Tribal Council. She served on the health, education and welfare committee of the tribe and at various times, chaired the committee. She made numerous trips to both the state capital, <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> and federal capital in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.%20C.">Washington, D. C.</a>, lobbying on behalf of the tribe. In an effort to improve situations for tribal members, she evaluated many programs for both economic and socio-cultural gains, looking at federal programs such as <a href="Job%20Corps">Job Corps</a> the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a>, and <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> loan programs for economic development. Riley represented three districts of the reservation and was instrumental in projects, such as the Alchesay-Williams Creek National Fish Hatchery Complex, the Fort Apache Timber Company (FATCO), and the <a href="Sunrise%20Park%20Resort">Sunrise Park Ski Resort and Hotel</a>, among others, to expand the tribal enterprises and provide economic stability for the tribe. 

Ground was broken for FATCO in 1962 and by 1963 had replaced the hiring of outside operators to manage the timber reserves of the tribe. By managing their own lumber harvests and operating three saw mills, the tribe was able to provide both jobs for tribal members and goods to sell to a wider clientele. Around the same time, the Alchesay-Williams Hatchery was developed to stock the local lakes which had been created on the reservation and protect species listed as <a href="Threatened%20species">threatened</a> or <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>. Employment opportunities for tribal members were increased through jobs at the hatchery, related jobs in the tourism sector, and additional revenues were garnered through the sale of fishing licenses. One of the largest projects was to convert 1.6 million acres of their lands into the Sunrise Park Resort. Constructing 20 recreational lakes, campsites, fishing and hunting venues, a ski resort, and hotels, the Tribal Council utilized their lands to generate a year-round tourist industry. 

Riley was interviewed as part of an <a href="Oral%20history%20preservation">Oral History Project</a> sponsored by the Arizona State Department of Libraries and Archives in 1977. After twenty years on the council, Riley retired in 1978. She was honored by the state in 1984 during the Statehood Day Celebrations for her leadership and development. Profits from FATCO were used to build the Mary V. Riley Building, which houses the tribal educational department.

Death and legacy.
Riley died on October 5, 1987 at White Mountain River Indian Hospital in <a href="Whiteriver%2C%20Arizona">Whiteriver, Arizona</a>. Posthumously, she was inducted into the <a href="Arizona%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Arizona Women's Hall of Fame</a>, in 1988.

Dierks Forests

Dierks Forests, Inc., known until 1954 as the Dierks Lumber and Coal Company and originally known as Choctaw Lumber Co., was a timber harvesting and processing company primarily in Oklahoma and Arkansas. Starting with a purchase of forest in 1903 in the Indian Territory, near Valliant, the company became known for its concept of the “traveling timber town”, in which the houses, school, church, and other buildings for the workers were moved periodically to stay close to the advancing logging site. The company eventually owned 1.75 million acres of timberland, and was one of the largest family-owned landholding entities in the United States before it was sold to the <a href="Weyerhaeuser">Weyerhaeuser Company</a> in 1969.

Legacy.
One of the Dierks timber-hauling steam locomotives, a 1917 wood-burning <a href="2-6-2">2-6-2</a> Prairie-type, was donated to the <a href="Tulsa%2C%20Oklahoma">City of Tulsa</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> after its retirement, and still stands in front of the west parking lot for the Tulsa Fairgrounds. That engine had “DIERKS FOREST” painted on the cab, while “207” was painted on the tender and on one of the locomotive domes. When the engine was repainted around 2011 or 2012, the lettering was lost.

The town of <a href="Dierks%2C%20Arkansas">Dierks, Arkansas</a> was named for Hans Dierks, the oldest of the four Dierks brothers associated with the company.

George Draper (physician)

Dr. George Draper (May 21, 1880 – July 1, 1959) was an American physician. He was affiliated with <a href="Columbia%20University%20College%20of%20Physicians%20and%20Surgeons">Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> and <a href="NewYork%E2%80%93Presbyterian%20Hospital">NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital</a>. Most famously known as <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s</a> personal doctor, Draper was also a well known constitutionalist and <a href="Eugenics">eugenicist</a>.  Draper was a key figure in developing a constitutional view of medicine during the 20th century.

Constitutionalism.
Constitutionalism was a movement in medicine away from the “one size fits all diagnosis” and towards re-introducing the individual into the medical diagnosis.  Constitutionalist like Draper placed importance on aspects of a patient’s constitution – this included heredity, their environment, and their personality. A patient’s constitution played a larger role in diagnosis than in pervious methods.

Draper received funding from the <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a> for his Constitution Clinic in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.  Draper sought to study <a href="Chronic%20condition">chronic diseases</a> and relate them to certain constitutions, believing that through an evaluation of a patient’s constitution, doctors would be able to give better diagnoses and decide on better treatments.

During this period, <a href="genetics">genetics</a> began to emerge as a field, as medicine began to solve the problem of infectious diseases and moved on to new issues. Draper folded heredity right into his view on constitution, appreciating the effect that heredity had on one’s constitution.

The Relationship of Human Constitution to Disease.
Draper wrote many papers on his theories of how constitution related to disease.  Draper believed that the susceptibility to disease is as important and worth of study as the disease itself.  He also countered the importance of disease itself – medicine had been focused on classifying disease ever since the rise of <a href="hospital%20medicine">hospital medicine</a> in the early 1800s, and Draper calls back instead to a prior time, when <a href="humoral%20theory">humoral theory</a> and the individual were more important in a medical diagnosis.  Draper defined a disease not as its own entity but as a thing carried by an individual, similar to humoral theory.

Draper defined constitution as follows: “Constitution is that aggregate of hereditarial characters, influenced more or less by the environment, which determines the individuals’ reaction, successful or unsuccessful, to the stress on environment.”Draper considered himself a naturalist, and was a devout follower of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a>. As a naturalist, Draper insisted on a complete study of the human body when regarding disease and constitution. He believed focusing on specific disease and labeling them generally led to problems, and believed that a complete study of the individual was necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment.

Draper defined the four aspects on constitution as <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a>, <a href="physiology">physiology</a>, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, and <a href="Immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a>.  Draper took these four “panels” of personality and would analyze them for large populations from his clinic and found certain combinations and repetitive patterns. His interpretation of his data led him to believe that give a single panel of a patient; he could determine the other three panels based on the one panel alone.  Draper believed in the extreme specificity of one’s constitution.  Draper valued the findings of <a href="Physiognomy">physiognomists</a> and <a href="Phrenology">phrenologists</a> in relating morphology to constitution and so to disease.

In relating constitution to classifying mankind, Draper was hesitant to classify mankind based on race, geography, and skin color – as many of his colleagues and other eugenicists did.  Instead, Draper introduced a concept of classifying the human race based on disease susceptibility.  Draper believe that race and geography differences between men made very little difference at all, and it was rather their disease susceptibility that set them apart.  In studies, Draper noticed that one’s race did not directly relate to one’s disease susceptibility, and suggested that people reorganize how they saw race. He understood that this would not work socially or politically, but stressed that it was a distinctive factor among mankind. Draper did find evidence for sex being a major factor in constitution.

Eugenics.
Draper was close with many eugenicists, despite stressing the importance of environment on one’s constitution.  He was a member of the Galton Society, that of <a href="Francis%20Galton">Francis Galton</a>, the father of <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>. He was also peers with <a href="Charles%20Davenport">Charles Davenport</a> and <a href="Harry%20H.%20Laughlin">Harry Laughlin</a> of the <a href="Eugenics%20Record%20Office">Eugenics Record Office</a>, and later joined the Eugenics Research Association at <a href="Cold%20Spring%20Harbor%20Laboratory">Cold Spring Harbor</a> himself.

Draper and Roosevelt.
Draper was best known as the personal doctor for <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">President Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>.  Aside from his Constitutional Clinic, Draper was a known expert in <a href="Poliomyelitis">polio</a>, and he was one of four doctors Roosevelt consulted at the onset of his own polio.  Draper was the only one of the four to correctly predict that Roosevelt would suffer from the symptoms of polio his entire life, and he personally attended to Roosevelt until the latter’s death. Draper's focus in treatment was the psychological aspect. Besides Roosevelt, another one of Draper's clients was <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a>, later a Supreme Court justice.

Draper was married to the interior designer <a href="Dorothy%20Draper">Dorothy Draper</a>.

Christine Jowers

Christine Jowers (born July 30th in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>) is an American dancer, teacher, producer, and dance critic. She is the founder and editor-in-chief of the leading online dance magazine, The Dance Enthusiast. She is known for her work as an advocate for dance and audience engagement through writing.

Life and Career.
Jowers was raised in <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands</a> by her parents Dolores Veronica and John M. Jowers. As the daughter of a museum curator at <a href="Fort%20Christian">Fort Christian</a> and the executive director of <a href="http%3A//www.vicouncilonarts.org/">Virgin Islands Council on the Arts</a>, she was exposed from an early age to a wide range of local and international artists. Through his work with VICA, her father collaborated with the <a href="National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Arts">National Endowment for the Arts</a>, <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20State%20Arts%20Agencies">National Assembly of State Arts Agencies</a>, and <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> to create cultural art expositions and concert performances that toured throughout the <a href="Caribbean%20Community">Caribbean</a>. Educated as a dancer at St. Thomas School of Dance and Ballet Theatre of the Virgin Islands, upon graduating from <a href="Sts.%20Peter%20%26amp%3B%20Paul%20School">Sts. Peter & Paul School</a>, Jowers was inspired by her father to study at <a href="Sarah%20Lawrence%20College">Sarah Lawrence College</a> and <a href="Goucher%20College">Goucher College</a> from which she graduated with a degree in Dance History/Criticism and Communications. 

After performing as principal dancer with <a href="Doris%20Humphrey">Doris Humphrey</a> Repertory Company, Jowers created Moving Arts Projects in 1997 to present her work as a soloist. During this period she would perform to great acclaim across the United States and Europe and collaborate on projects with numerous renowned artists including <a href="Margie%20Gillis">Margie Gillis</a>, <a href="Ann%20Carlson">Ann Carlson</a>, <a href="Janis%20Brenner">Janis Brenner</a>, <a href="Larry%20Keigwin">Larry Keigwin,</a> Kun Yang Lin, Catherine Gallant, and the future artistic director of <a href="Martha%20Graham%20Dance%20Company">Martha Graham Dance Company</a>, Janet Eilber. Shifting her focus from performing, Jowers began teaching as a guest artist at the <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Lim%C3%B3n">Jose Limón</a> Institute, <a href="Laban%20Centre%20for%20Movement%20and%20Dance">Laban Centre for Movement and Dance</a>, Danceworks (UK), Islington Arts Factory, <a href="Liverpool%20Institute%20for%20Performing%20Arts">Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Roehampton">University of Roehampton</a>, <a href="Goucher%20College">Goucher College</a>, and <a href="Kean%20College">Kean College</a> while also contributing writing to Dance/USA, <a href="The%20Hopkins%20Review">The Hopkins Review</a>, and <a href="HuffPost">The Huffington Post.</a> 

In 2007 she founded the Dance Enthusiast to set off "an exuberant "revolution" in dance communication". Responding to the diminishing presence of dance coverage in the news, Jowers grew and expanded a team of writers out of her home to revitalize the dance field through numerous opportunities offered by operating online, including video coverage and innovative audience engagement platforms that allowed concert attendees to publish their own reflections and reviews. Recently, Jowers launched a highly acclaimed concert series called "Enthusiastic Events" that allows artists to perform and speak with the audience about the artform directly. Acclaimed artists who have participated in these events include the Martha Graham Dance Company, the Broadway choreographer Chet Walker, the director of the Museum at <a href="Fashion%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Fashion Institute of Technology</a> <a href="Valerie%20Steele">Valerie Steele</a>, the flamenco guitarist <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Carbonell">El Bola</a>, and the <a href="Litefeet">Litefeet</a> master Chrybaby Cozie. 

To date, the Dance Enthusiast remains a leading outlet for dance journalism, interviews, and artistic advocacy in NYC.

Rhinocladiella mackenziei

Rhinocladiella mackenziei is a pigmented fungus and is a common cause of human cerebral phaeohyphomycosis. "Rhinocladiella mackenziei" was believed to be endemic solely to the Middle East, due to the first cases of infection being limited to the region. However, cases of "R. mackenziei" infection are increasingly reported from regions outside the Middle East. The agent is dissimilar to typically opportunistic agents of fungal disease in that the majority of cases have been reported from immunologically normal people.

History.
"Rhinocladiella mackenziei" was first identified in 1993 as "Ramichloridium mackenziei" by C.K. Campbell & Al-Hedaithy when it was identified as the cause of eight cases of human cerebral <a href="phaeohyphomycosis">phaeohyphomycosis</a>. All eight patients had <a href="abscess">abscess</a> formation and six of the patients had aspirated pus with branching hyphae. Campbell and Al-Hedaithy considered different genera for the un-named fungus, including "Zasmidium", "Leptodontidium", "Ramichloridium", and "Rhinocladiella". They elected to place it in the genus "Ramichloridium" based on morphological similarity. In previous publications, Naim-Ur-Rahman misidentified the fungus in the genus "Cladosporium", while Al-Hedaithy et al (1988) considered it synonymous with "<a href="Fonsecaea%20pedrosoi">Fonsecaea pedrosoi</a>".

The genus "Ramichloridium" encompasses asexual species that produce upright, darkly pigmented, apically elongating, zig-zag-shaped conidiophores that produce single-celled <a href="conidia">conidia</a>. It was first described in 1937 by Stahel as "Ramichloridium musae" but the genus was considered invalid as Stahel's publication lacked a Latin diagnosis. The genus "Ramichloridium" was re-introduced by de Hoog in 1977 typified by "R. apiculatum".

"Rhinocladiella mackenziei" was treated in the genus "Ramichloridium" until Arzanlou and coworkers explored the phylogeny of "Ramichloridium" and its related genera through partial sequences of the 28S (LSU) <a href="rRNA">rRNA</a> gene and the ITS region. The fungus was found to cluster in the Chaetothyriales clade along with "Rhinocladiella" species and was subsequently transferred to the genus "Rhinocladiella". One of the main features that helped distinguish "Ramichloridium" and "Rhinocladiella" is the presence of "<a href="Exophiala">Exophiala</a>"-like budding cells in "Rhinocladiella", which were also seen in "R. mackenziei". Additionally, the conidiophores of "R. mackenziei" resemble undifferentiated from the vegetative hyphae in contrast to those in "Ramichloridium" that are differentiated.

Habitat and ecology.
"Rhinocladiella mackenziei" is found in the hot and arid climates of temperate and tropical regions. It is considered <a href="endemic">endemic</a> throughout the Middle East, specifically Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar, and infections by this species have been observed in individuals from Afghanistan, Iran, and India. It is known less commonly to inhabit temperate and tropical regions. The environmental niche of "R. mackenziei" remains unknown. Another fungus associated with causing cerebral phaeohyphomycosis; "<a href="Cladophialophora%20bantiana">Cladophialophora bantiana</a>", has been isolated in one occasion from sawdust, which could also be a possible source of "R. mackenziei". Due to the lack of knowledge about its environmental niche, it has been difficult to isolate "R. mackenziei"; and selective techniques such as the use of high temperatures, mouse vectors, alkyl benzenes and mineral oils are required. Enrichment of growth media with volatile <a href="aromatic%20hydrocarbons">aromatic hydrocarbons</a> improves recovery of this agent, implying a role for aromatic hydrocarbon degradation in its environmental niche.

Morphology and reproduction.
"Rhinocladiella mackenziei" is a <a href="black%20yeast">black yeast</a>-like fungus with holoblastic conidia (conidia that are produced by simple budding) that are broadly oval and more than 2μm wide. In vitro at 30 °C, "R. mackenziei" has smooth, pigmented, septate <a href="hyphae">hyphae</a> and narrower, pale brown aerial hyphae. Its <a href="conidiophores">conidiophores</a> are undifferentiated or only slightly differentiated from vegetative hyphae, and produce brown, smooth-walled, oval conidia. "Rhinocladiella mackenziei" grows slowly in culture media. Colonies grown for a week at 30 °C on glucose peptone agar develop a dark grey-brown to black appearance with a black reverse, elevated center, and densely cottony texture. "Rhinocladiella mackenziei" grows poorly at 25 °C and is not to produce a sexual state.

Disease in humans.
"Rhinocladiella mackenziei" is a black yeast-like <a href="neurotropic">neurotropic</a> fungus and one of the three main causative agents of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis. Histologically, infection by this agent causes the cerebrospinal fluid to become blackish and necrotic, pus-filled lesions to develop in brain tissue. "R. mackenziei" is mostly found in brain abscesses of <a href="immunocompetent">immunocompetent</a> patients, however infection has been reported in conjunction with <a href="Primary%20central%20nervous%20system%20lymphoma">Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma</a> (PCNSL). Infection by this agent is associated with extremely high mortality despite aggressive antifungal treatment and surgery. Symptoms may include headaches, fevers, neurological deficits, seizures, <a href="hemiparesis">hemiparesis</a> and even psychotic behavior. Infection is thought to result from exposure to conidia through inhalation, ingestion or through skin lesions. Diagnosis of cerebral phaeohyphomycosis by "R. mackenziei" is confirmed by the microscopic observation of pigmented fungal elements in affected tissues combined with the identification of the agent by culture or genetic sequencing. Central nervous system colonization is thought to be secondary to spread through blood and lymph tissue. The basis for the affinity of "R. mackenziei" for brain tissue is unknown but has been hypothesized to involve the fungal melanin which acts as a virulence factor by allowing it to evade a human host's immune system and cross the <a href="Blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood-brain barrier</a>. Melanin also protects the fungal cell wall from <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> by binding to free radicals and hypochlorite produced by <a href="phagocytic%20cells">phagocytic cells</a> as well as antifungal drugs, blocking them from acting upon the fungal pathogen.
Treatment.
Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis by "Rhinocladiella mackenziei" has a mortality rate of nearly 100%, with no instances of documented survival of patients. "Rhinocladiella mackenziei" has been shown to be resistant to <a href="Amphotericin%20B">Amphotericin B</a>, an antifungal drug commonly used to treat fungal infections, both <a href="in%20vivo">in vivo</a> and <a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>. Susceptibility to <a href="triazoles">triazoles</a> such as <a href="itraconazole">itraconazole</a>, <a href="posaconazole">posaconazole</a> and <a href="isavuconazole">isavuconazole</a> has been seen in 10 strains of "R. mackenziei", though a mixture of amphotericin B, itraconazole and <a href="5-flucytosine">5-flucytosine</a> has been associated with poor outcome in animal and clinical studies. Approaches to disease management typically involve combined antifungal chemotherapy (<a href="combination%20therapy">combination therapy</a>), surgical <a href="debridement">debridement</a> and <a href="immunotherapy">immunotherapy</a>.

Welsh Development Agency v Export Finance Co Ltd

Welsh Development Agency v Export Finance Co Ltd [1992] BCLC 148 (often abbreviated to WDA v Exfinco) is a judicial decision of the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">English Court of Appeal</a>. The decision related to a number of aspects relating to complex financing arrangement, but is most often cited for the decision in relation to <a href="recharacterisation">recharacterisation</a>.

The decision is now probably the leading English law case in relation to recharacterisation risk in financial transactions.

Facts.
The <a href="Parrot%20Corporation">Parrot Corporation</a> was a company which manufactured and exported <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a>s. The company was a start-up venture funded by the <a href="Welsh%20Development%20Agency">Welsh Development Agency</a> (WDA). As part of the financing provided to the company by the WDA, the WDA took security by means of an all-assets <a href="floating%20charge">floating charge</a> over the company's assets and undertaking.

The company then sought to raise further finance from the Export Finance Co Ltd (Exfinco). That financing was documented principally under a master agreement which <a href="Christopher%20Staughton">Staughton LJ</a> referred to in the judgment as "a document of remarkable complexity". Under that agreement, broadly, every time the company agreed an overseas sale, it triggered a mandatory offer from Exfinco to buy the goods from the company, and then promptly resell the goods to the overseas purchaser. In relation to the resale the company would act as agent for Exfinco and Exfinco would be the undisclosed principal. Accordingly, the only person whom the overseas buyers ever dealt with was the company - they were unaware of the role played by Exfinco in each and every sale. The company would then also receive the purchase price from the overseas buyer as agent for Exfinco, and those sums would be paid into a segregated account which was completely under the control of Exfinco. The goods sold overseas would be subject to a <a href="title%20retention%20clause">title retention clause</a> in favour of Exfinco.

The Parrot Corporation began to encounter severe financial difficulties, partly because of the collapse in the price of floppy disks, but also allegations of financial irregularities swirled around the company. On 16 May 1989 the company ceased trading, and a dispute arose between WDA and Exfinco as to whether the arrangements under the master agreement were effective, and accordingly who had the better claim to moneys paid (and still payable) by overseas buyers to the company.

Decision.
High Court.
At first instance the matter came before <a href="Nicolas%20Browne-Wilkinson%2C%20Baron%20Browne-Wilkinson">Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson VC</a>. The Vice-Chancellor ruled in favour of WDA on two alternative grounds.

Court of Appeal.
Exfinco appealed against the Vice Chancellor's decision, and also lodged counterclaims against the <a href="receivership">receivers</a> appointed by the WDA for <a href="Torts%20%28Interference%20with%20Goods%29%20Act%201977">tortious interference with their property</a>.

All three judges of the Court of Appeal gave reasoned judgments, but the first and longest judgment was given by <a href="Brian%20Dillon%20%28judge%29">Dillon LJ</a>.

Dillon LJ considered a preliminary point as to whether WDA could be taken to have consented to the financing arrangements by virtue of the fact that they had appointed a director to the <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of the company</a>, and thus the proper construction of the debenture granted to WDA was to exclude receivables from overseas buyers. That suggestion was summarily dismissed as wholly inconsistent with the terms of the document.

Contractual uncertainty.
After reviewing the key terms of the master agreement, he then turned to the issue of fundamental uncertainty. He held that to the extent that there was any uncertainty, it could be resolved under the <a href="legal%20maxim">legal maxim</a> "<a href="List_of_Latin_phrases_%28C%29">id certum est quod certum reddi potest</a>" ("if something is capable of being made certain, it should be treated as certain"). In this case it was possible to ascertain by inquiry in any individual case on what basis the contract was made. Applying the test set down by <a href="Andrew%20Murray%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Dunedin">Lord Dunedin</a> in "May & Butcher Ltd v R" [1934] 2 KB 17 at 21 and <a href="Kenneth%20Diplock%2C%20Baron%20Diplock">Lord Diplock</a> in "Sudbrook Trading Estate Ltd v Eggleton" [1983] 1 AC 444 at 478. Under the master agreement the question as to who was the principal under the agreement would only arise in the event of a claim for breach of warranty as to the fitness of the goods. This was entirely consistent with older cases relating to subsequent inquiries in relation to alleged latent defects in shipments of goods.

On this point, <a href="Christopher%20Staughton">Staughton LJ</a> agreed. <a href="Ralph%20Gibson%20%28judge%29">Ralph Gibson LJ</a> was initially hesitant, describing it as an "uneasy application" of the legal principle, but ultimately also concurred.

Recharacterisation.
In relation to the issue of recharacterisation, Dillon LJ commenced by differentiating between "sham transactions" and transactions where the true character was not as described in the documents. He also noted that the different authorities on recharacterisation tend to use very different language depending upon the particular legal field: "It is ... not surprising that the words used by eminent judges in different cases in applying the principle do not all fit very harmoniously together." Slightly less kindly Staughton LJ referred to the "bewildering array of authority on this topic, some of it by no means easy to reconcile."

He then carefully reviewed the authorities, and quoted at length from the decision of <a href="Mark%20Romer%2C%20Baron%20Romer">Romer LJ</a> in "Re George Inglefield Ltd" [1933] Ch 1 at 27-28 in relation to the essential differences between a sale transaction and a mortgage transaction. However, having reviewed the position he was driven to conclude:

Instead, he sought to apply the decision of <a href="Farrer%20Herschell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Herschell">Lord Herschell</a> in "McEntire v Crossley Bros" [1895] AC 457 at 462-463 where he said: "...the agreement must be regarded as a whole - its substance must be looked at. The parties cannot, by the insertion of any mere words, defeat the effect of the transaction as appearing from the whole of the agreement into which they have entered. ... you must look at the agreement as a whole and see what its substantial effect is." In this case, at trial, the Vice Chancellor has been concerned that the clauses in the master agreement under the headings "the right of redemption" and "the discount" were consistent with a mortgage, but not with a true sale. However Dillon LJ took the view that it was wrong to take those clauses in isolation and they needed to be read together with the other clauses relating to sale. He then reviewed various cases which considered the difference between charging interest on a loan, and sales made on a discounted basis.

After a very long and careful review of the terms of the document, Dillon LJ concluded that a security arrangement was inconsistent with the express terms of the document. He noted the comments of <a href="Richard%20Wilberforce%2C%20Baron%20Wilberforce">Lord Wilberforce</a> in "Lloyds & Scottish Finance Ltd v Cyril Lord Carpet Sales Ltd" [1992] BCLC 609 at 615: "It would be a strange doctrine of 'looking for the substance' or 'looking through the documents' which would produce a contractual intention so clearly negated by the documents and by oral evidence." Applying that test, Dillon LJ held:

Ralph Gibson LJ briefly agreed on this point, without considering it in detail. Staughton LJ reviewed all of the arguments raised by WDA, but concluded that "none [are] in my opinion inconsistent with a contract of sale." Accordingly he upheld the parties' bargain.

Liability of receivers.
In relation to the counterclaim of Exfinco against the receivers for interfering with the unpaid receivables from the overseas buyers the court split: Dillon LJ and Ralph Gibson LJ dismissed the counterclaim, but Staughton LJ dissented on this point. The majority broadly held that because the receivers were agents of the company itself, they could not be liable for inducing any breach of contract where the company was the principal under the relevant contracts. Dillon LJ felt that he was bound by the decision in "Said v Butt" [1920] 3 KB 497, although he expressed "grave reservations" over the reasoning. But ultimately he was not prepared to overturn an authority which had stood for so long.

Staughton LJ dissented on the basis that the entire point of the arrangement was that the company was not the principal under those contracts - Exfinco was the principal, and the company was only its agent. Accordingly, the receivers should still be subject to liability if they intentionally interfered with what, in law, was a contract of sale between the overseas buyer and Exfinco. 

All three judges agreed that section 234 of the <a href="Insolvency%20Act%201986">Insolvency Act 1986</a> would not afford a defence to the receivers if they were otherwise liable.

Authority.
The decision is now treated as the leading authority in relation to characerterisation issues in finance contracts.

The decision is sometimes contrasted with "<a href="Re%20Curtain%20Dream%20plc">Re Curtain Dream plc</a>" [1990] BCLC 925, a case decided at broadly the same time and on similar facts, but which reached the opposite conclusion. An appeal in "Re Curtain Dream" was compromised after the decision of the Court of Appeal was handed down in "WDA v Exfinco".

Early years.
Scheyer was born on March 6, 1900 in <a href="Dunkirk%2C%20New%20York">Dunkirk, New York</a> and following the graduation from the high school, he entered the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> at <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>. Scheyer graduated on June 7, 1923 and was commissioned Second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on the same day.

<doc id="54855853" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54855853" title="Ritmo Latino">
Ritmo Latino

Ritmo Latino was a Latin-oriented retail music chain. It currently exists as a T-Mobile franchise partner under the name Ritmo Latino Wireless. From 1989 until 2010, Ritmo operated its music retail stores across the United States, primarily in Hispanic areas. With 53 stores at its peak, Ritmo was the largest Latin music chain in the United States.

History.
In 1989, David Massry opened the first Ritmo Latino store in Santa Ana, California. He named it Ritmo Latino (Spanish for “Latin Rhythm”) in order to appeal to its Hispanic customer base.

Ritmo Latino has been noted by its ability to provide innovative services and experiences to its customers that were not typically provided by niche music stores at that time. Ritmo expanded its business model in 1992, by becoming an authorized Ticketmaster vendor to provide additional services to its customers in all of its stores, and in 1998, by introducing the first Spanish Book Department in its store in Santa Ana.

In 1999, the first Ritmo Rock opened in LA. Ritmo Rock is a store concept dedicated to Latin and English rock, something Massry called “a niche within a niche.”

In 2000, Ritmo Latino sponsored the first Premio de la Gente awards, which was created to award Latin music based on fans votes. The show was nationally televised with Uno Productions. Although Ritmo Latino no longer sponsors the show, it continues to air annually on Telemundo.

Ritmo Latino continued to innovate by incorporating interactive technology into its stores. In 2001, Ritmo began putting Video Arcade rooms in its stores. In 2003, Ritmo’s store in Miami became the first Latin music store to implement interactive listening stations. The listening stations were such a success that the company adopted the technology into all of its stores. In 2005, Ritmo launched an educational computer software line specifically designed for the Spanish speaking market.

By 2007, Ritmo had 52 stores in the U.S., in states such as California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Washington D.C., Maryland, and New Jersey. They opened 3 new stores inside El Gallo Giro Restaurants and launched the first Tus Perfumenes, a store within a store concept dedicated to selling a full line of perfumes, in Oakland. Ritmo also received notable media attention when it accused Jennifer Lopez of not supporting her Latin heritage because she would not make public appearances promoting her album Como Ama Un Mujer at any Latin-oriented music chain. Ritmo further garnered attention by banning all of Lopez’s CDs from its stores.

As the music retail industry declined, so did Ritmo Latino. In 2008, Ritmo Latino inaugurated their first transition to T-Mobile store in El Monte, CA, and opened 2 more stores by year’s end. In 2009, Ritmo opened an additional 13 T-Mobile stores, including stores in the Northern California, Houston, and Washington D.C. markets, bring the total T-Mobile store count to 16.

The last Ritmo Latino music store closed in July, 2010, and Ritmo Latino Inc was officially dissolved by the end of 2011.

Production.
Development.
The show was officially renewed by <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> for a 22-episode third season on March 16, 2017. David Madden, Fox's Entertainment President stated, "It takes a very special team to tell the tales of "Gotham". For the past two seasons, Bruno, Danny and John have masterfully honored the mythology of "Gotham" and brought it to life with depth, emotion and memorable high drama."

At 2016 <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con">San Diego Comic-Con</a>, executive producer <a href="John%20Stephens%20%28TV%20producer%29">John Stephens</a> explained the structure for the season: "We're doing eleven [episodes] in the Fall, then there's three episodes in January, then the final run of seven or eight episodes in the Spring. [The three] is not a self-contained [series of] episodes, because it extends what we're doing in the Fall, but it is an ended story, so we'll arc it out." Just like the second season, the third season also carried a two subtitles for the season. The first 14 episodes of the season: "Mad City"; and the other 8 episodes: "Heroes Rise". On June 2016, <a href="Drew%20Powell">Drew Powell</a> revealed on a tweet the first two episodes of the season.

Writing.
According to Stephens, the structure for the season "We extend [the longer story arcs] in season three. We've made the story even more serialized in season three. Everybody goes through a major character metamorphosis throughout the course of the year."

The fourth episode introduced a political aspect for the show, with critics noting emphasis on <a href="Donald%20Trump%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">Donald Trump's 2016 campaign</a>. Actor <a href="Robin%20Lord%20Taylor">Robin Lord Taylor</a> talked about the approach, "I think the "Gotham" writers are writing our actual reality right now, and that's probably the scariest thing you could possibly imagine. He tries to present himself as he thinks a candidate should look. There is a certain homage to a certain candidate who is out there which is entirely intentional. Our show is like any comic book in that the stories are written to reflect the times in which we live. Comic books are written with that idea in mind, the social climate. So our show is reflecting that."

In August 2016, the producers talked about introducing <a href="Harley%20Quinn">Harley Quinn</a> into the series despite the character's success in the film "<a href="Suicide%20Squad%20%28film%29">Suicide Squad</a>". Executive producer <a href="John%20Stephens%20%28TV%20producer%29">John Stephens</a> explained that they would rather see a "proto-version" of Harley Quinn possibly in the third or fourth season. He also added introducing "proto-versions" of <a href="Killer%20Croc">Killer Croc</a> and <a href="Solomon%20Grundy%20%28comics%29">Solomon Grundy</a> in the show. On January 2017, the producers began to hint about Quinn's appearance in the third season finale with Stephens claiming that "we might see her in episode 22" and that the character would be the "launching point" for the central plot of season 4 and finally a few days before the episode, <a href="David%20Mazouz">David Mazouz</a> claimed the character would appear in the episode. However, Quinn did not appear in the finale; it was confirmed in a June 2017 <a href="TVLine">TVLine</a> article that there were no plans at that time to feature Quinn on the show.

Casting.
On June 13, 2016, it was revealed that Ivy Pepper's character would be promoted to main cast member and the actress would be recast with an older actress. On June 22, 2016, Maggie Geha was cast in the new version, is "due to a brush with one of Hugo Strange's creatures, last seen escaping into the Gotham night at the end of Season 2." John Stephens spoke about this, "The mentality of the Ivy we have in our world is not the same as the Ivy who exists in the canon. She's a bit more of a loose cannon. And so she goes and creates a great deal of havoc in our world. And because she is still a 14-year-old, 15-year-old street teenager in the body of a 25-year-old woman, she doesn't know how to act in the world yet, and so she has to fumble her way about." Stephens also explained why they decided to recast her, "We made the change for two reasons: The character Ivy in the comics, one of her greatest powers is the power of seduction. Everyone was much more comfortable with that with an older actress as opposed to a teenager. We want to explore that classic, canonical power of Ivy. And we didn't just make her older with that attack. When she's changed and transformed, there's a real character change as well. She'll still have some of the same traits, but she'll be much darker, more manipulative than the Ivy we've seen so far. There's a more evil quality to her as well. It's more than just physical."

On June 2016, it was revealed that the <a href="Mad%20Hatter%20%28comics%29">Mad Hatter</a> would be appearing in the third season. On July 18, "<a href="The%20Walking%20Dead%20%28TV%20series%29">The Walking Dead</a>"s vet <a href="Benedict%20Samuel">Benedict Samuel</a> was cast in the role, with the role described as "a talented hypnotist teetering on the edge of madness. He arrives in Gotham with an unwavering desire to find his sister, Alice, a young woman who went missing in the city years ago." On August 23, 2016, <a href="Naian%20Gonzalez%20Norvind">Naian Gonzalez Norvind</a> was cast as his sister, Alice, with her role being described as "she has a powerful ability she was born with, that she thinks is a curse and Jervis Tetch aka Mad Hatter, thinks is a gift."

Other additions include <a href="Jamie%20Chung">Jamie Chung</a> as Valerie Vale, with the role being described as "a crackerjack reporter dead set on uncovering the truth behind Indian Hill. Confident and dogged, she will do anything to get the scoop, and soon sets her sights on Gordon, who she believes is the key lead in her story." The note also revealed that the character is the aunt of fellow comic book character <a href="Vicki%20Vale">Vicki Vale</a>. 3 days after the cast announcement, <a href="James%20Carpinello">James Carpinello</a> was cast as <a href="Mario%20Falcone%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Mario Falcone</a>, son of <a href="Carmine%20Falcone">Carmine Falcone</a>, whose role was described as "Mario has rejected his family's criminal ways and made a legitimate life for himself as a well-respected, Ivy League-educated ER doctor. He's kind, honest and trustworthy, making him the black sheep of the Falcone clan." On November 2016, <a href="James%20Remar">James Remar</a> was cast as Frank Gordon, Gordon's uncle, in a role that was described as "The elder Gordon left Gotham after Jim's father died, but 25 years later, he's back and looking to reconnect with his nephew. But Frank has a dark secret that will force Jim to choose between saving his family and saving Gotham." Remar is the second "<a href="Dexter%20%28TV%20series%29">Dexter</a>" vet to join the show, the first being <a href="David%20Zayas">David Zayas</a>. On January 10, 2017, <a href="Raymond%20J.%20Barry">Raymond J. Barry</a> was announced to have a recurring role in the season as a man only known as the Shaman. His role was described as "a mysterious figure who enters Bruce's (Mazouz) life with the stated intention of unlocking the potential of his own mind." After much speculation, on March 2, 2017, <a href="Alexander%20Siddig">Alexander Siddig</a> was cast to portray <a href="Ra%27s%20al%20Ghul">Ra's al Ghul</a>. He was described as being the leader behind the <a href="Court%20of%20Owls">Court of Owls</a> and also the leader of the <a href="League%20of%20Assassins">League of Shadows</a>.

Design.
The season also introduces Nygma finally accepting himself as <a href="Riddler">The Riddler</a> and the use of his signature green suit. Series regular <a href="Cory%20Michael%20Smith">Cory Michael Smith</a> has been commenting for over a year that while he hasn't figured out how the costume for the Riddler would be, he was confident it will "certainly be a green suit"; stating that the fittings for the costume were already underway by July 2016. He also added that the new Riddler won't be like the version of <a href="Jim%20Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> in the film "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>". He claimed, "I want him to be kind of showy. So what we have as the Riddler costume is really classy, and that's kind of what we wanted."

After the winter finale's airing, new images and promos surfaced showcasing Nygma's green suit, signaling his recognition as the imminent Riddler. Smith commented, "When I put it on, we used the same tailors that make all my suits. It was just beautiful, with the black velvet. We have these gorgeous black shoes with just a hint of a purple/maroon thing, just on the shoes. I got really excited, because it was shocking on the rack, but then it was on my body and I was like, 'This feels so right.'" While initially hesitant about by the "glittery green suit", he said it was a happy day when he put on the suit although he has been multiple times hoping for the Riddler's signature cane. He also said about Nygma, "It's his time to declare that he has accepted the role that fate has given him, and he's going to be a villain, wreak havoc and show people that everyone has underestimated him. He started to feel like the world was deciding for him that it wasn't what he deserved or what he's going to have. That potentially could be one of the scariest (aspects), to be very smooth and poised." while executive producer <a href="John%20Stephens%20%28TV%20producer%29">John Stephens</a> said, "The affection he has for tricks and plans and puzzles, it's his way of applying order to what he sees as a disordered universe." Stephens claimed that he saw his progression as a hero's journey rather than a tragedy.

Filming.
Filming for the season began on July 21, 2017, at <a href="Steiner%20Studios">Steiner Studios</a> in <a href="Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York">Brooklyn, New York</a>. <a href="Ben%20McKenzie">Ben McKenzie</a>, who portrays Gordon in the show, made his directional debut on the sixteenth episode, "". According to the releases, the episode was the first of the whole series to make an extensive use of wires during the action scenes. Previous scenes were done practically at the instance of McKenzie, who wanted the show to feel "grounded." McKenzie commented, "They wrote the episode so I was on location in 15, so we could shoot everything in one day. I only missed one day of prep to film as an actor in episode 15, and that allowed me to go through the full process, which, honestly, I've been through before because I've shadowed directors both on <a href="Southland%20%28TV%20series%29">Southland</a> and "Gotham"." He also added, "As a director, you're given a lot of people coming up to you constantly asking for your opinion on everything from which location you should shoot at, how that location should be dressed, props, casting, dialogue."

Release.
Broadcast.
The season premiered on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> on September 19, 2016 and concluded on June 5, 2017 with a two-hour season finale.

<doc id="54858043" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54858043" title="MMX Open Art Venue">
MMX Open Art Venue

MMX Open Art Venue was an art gallery in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, founded in 2010 as a one-year art experiment and reincarnated as re:MMX in 2012. The MMX project, which included the works of more than 200 international artists, was noted as the revival of the concept of <a href="artist%20collective">artist collective</a>s in Berlin.

History.
The project for the gallery started in October 2009, after three months of renovations of 1000 square meters in a formerly squatted and abandoned building in Linienstraße, in the heart of the commercial art district of <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>'s <a href="Mitte">Mitte</a>. The building's new owners wanted to use it for something innovative during one year while they were sorting out the paperwork. MMX Open Art Venue officially started on New Year 2010.

The founders of MMX were artists <a href="Rebecca%20Loyche">Rebecca Loyche</a> and Jonathan Gröger. They curated and directed the gallery for a year, using the space for alternative ways to show international art. During that time, more than 200 international artists exhibited on the ground floor of the building. The final exhibition, "Show VII", opened in October 2010. It gathered artists from all over the world, and each artist took a room, moulded it, and presented artwork that embodied the theme "the end is just the beginning."

When MMX closed its doors in 2011, the building became the venue for undercover street artists in a project that became known as "The Cave." Meanwhile, the gallery founders opened a new art space, called Co-Verlag, in April 2012.

However, the developers who bought the MMX site invited the founders back, so they started re:MMX, a gallery curating large-scale <a href="public%20art">public art</a>, in September 2012. Re:MMX reinstalled some old popular works from MMX, kept the <a href="street%20art">street art</a> from The Cave project, and added new panoramic video works, photography and painting. Using the fact that the place was a construction site, the artists explored the idea of transformation. Re:MMX ended in March 2013.

Aftermath.
MMX was described as a project that "channeled the spirit of the early years after the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a> fell" and "reinvigorated the concept of <a href="artist%20collective">artist collective</a>s in Berlin."

The whole project was documented in a book, "MMX Open Art Venue - One Year One Book," which was published in 2011 after a successful <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> drive.

"The Obelisk Gate" takes place on a single <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a>, the Stillness, which suffers from catastrophic climate change every few centuries (the so-called "Fifth Season"). The book continues forward from an especially bad Fifth Season, one that may become an apocalypse. It follows two main characters: a mother and daughter, both of whom are magically talented ("orogenes"), who were separated just before the most recent Fifth Season. The plot revolves around their journey to find each other once again, and their efforts to discover why Fifth Seasons exist.

Reception.
"The Obelisk Gate" was anticipated on its debut, and reviews were highly positive. Writing for <a href="NPR">NPR</a>, poet <a href="Amal%20El-Mohtar">Amal El-Mohtar</a> said that "Not only could I not put it down—I couldn't come up for air long enough to comment on it while forsaking sleep and food in order to finish it", continuing on to say that "It pole vaults over the expectations I had for what epic fantasy should be and stands in magnificent testimony to what it could be." It later appeared on "<a href="The%20Verge">The Verge</a>"s list of the best science fiction and fantasy novels of 2016, where they wrote that the book "is an incredibly ambitious and important novel" that "continues to build on its predecessor's brilliance", as well as <a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">"Wired"s</a>, who believed that it was better than "The Fifth Season".

<a href="Tor%20Books">"Tor"</a> was critical of "The Obelisk Gate" for falling into what its reviewer called "middle volume syndrome," believing that the book "sacrifices "The Fifth Season"s substance and sense of momentum for a far slighter and slower story. ... "The Obelisk Gate" is small and safe where "The Fifth Season" was large and surprising, practically static where said was speedy; and although it builds out the world and its workings well ... it's a shame ... that such a stunning start should be succeeded by such a sedentary, albeit completely readable sequel." "Wired", on the other hand, praised the book for escaping that syndrome, or what it called the typical "stalling" of middle books.

Awards.
"The Obelisk Gate" won the <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">for Best Novel</a> in 2017. It was the second award for Jemisin's Broken Earth series (after "The Fifth Season" in 2016), making Jemisin the first author in over two decades to win the Best Novel Hugo in two consecutive years. Moreover, "The Obelisk Gate"s victory came as part of a women-heavy slate of winners at the 2017 Hugos, which included best novel, novella, novelette, and short story.

Outside of the Hugos, "The Obelisk Gate" was nominated for the <a href="Nebula%20Award">Nebula Award</a> <a href="Nebula%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">for Best Novel</a>, but lost to <a href="Charlie%20Jane%20Anders">Charlie Jane Anders</a>' "<a href="All%20the%20Birds%20in%20the%20Sky">All the Birds in the Sky</a>". It won <a href="RT%20Book%20Reviews">RT Book Reviews</a>' 2016 award for best <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> novel.

IYOV

IYOV is an opera-requiem for prepared piano, cello, drums and voices by composers Roman Grygoriv and Illia Razumeiko, directed by Vlad Troitskyi. 

Performance history.
"IYOV" was created in 2015 at the order of the festival of contemporary art <a href="Gogolfest">GogolFest"."</a> 

Synopsis.
<a href="Job%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Job</a> (Iyov in Hebrew) is the central character of the <a href="Book%20of%20Job">Book of Job</a> in the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. This is a story of his life, pride and disbelief, the search for life's meaning and death, hope and regret.

The center of musical scenography is the prepared piano that turns into a real orchestra. The pianist and singers use a wide range of percussion instruments such as snare drum, marimba and timpani sticks, triangle, ride cymbal. They use coins, keys, fingers and nails for playing on the strings and the body of the grand piano. The instrument sounds like a harpsichord, drums and occasionally as a synthesizer or electronic sounds generator.

Music of "IYOV" combines minimalism and the avant-garde, neoclassicism and rock. Polyphonic choral episodes and instrumental interludes alternate with the parts that use a full range of the human voice: from classical, jazz and folk singing to breathing, screaming, whispering and overtone singing.  

The dramaturgy of music performance is based on the сontrast compilation of recitatives based on the Book of Job and parts of Requiem - Catholic Mass, which refers to traditional Latin texts. 

Opera-requiem "IYOV" is a synthesis of ancient Greek drama, baroque opera, oratorio, Requiem, and the techniques of postmodern theater. It is the mystery of the birth of a new sound inside the piano and the demonstration of endless possibilities of the human voice.

Wenamba

The <a href="Wenamba">Wenamba</a> are an <a href="indigenous%20Australian">indigenous Australian</a> people of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>.

Language.
The Wenamba spoke a dialect similar to that of the <a href="Pintupi">Pintupi</a>.

Country.
The Wenamba ranged over an estimated . <a href="Norman%20Tindale">Norman Tindale</a> places them to the north of the <a href="Rawlinson%20Ranges">Rawlinson Ranges</a> and <a href="Lake%20Neale">Lake Neale</a> and <a href="Lake%20Hopkins">Lake Hopkins</a>, extending northwards to the area of <a href="Lake%20Macdonald">Lake Macdonald</a>. Their western limits are set at a place called "Kurultu/Kurultja", believed to be somewhere around the Baron Range.

People.
The Wenamba, though tribally distinct, were closely affiliated to the Pintupi. The <a href="Pitjantjatjara">Pitjantjatjara</a> name for them was "A:wuntara", from their word "a:wu", meaning 'yes', implying that they were 'yes people' since they were said to reply to any and every inquiry by responding in the affirmative. The Wenamba were one of several desert tribes known generically as "Kalgonei/Kalgoneidjara", One telling term used of them,"Mangawara" meant '<a href="chignon">chignon</a> bearers' referring to their dressing their hair in buns, which in turn served to hold some of their possessions.

History.
The police ranger <a href="Walter%20MacDougall">Walter MacDougall</a> was the first white man known to have contact with the Wenamba. While camping none night near the Rawlinson Ranges, his attention was drawn to a shuffling noise, and he looked up and noticed a little native girl quietly walking towards the campfire. He broke the tension by remarking in <a href="Pitjantjatjara%20dialect">Pitjantjatjara</a> on the <a href="Bush%20tomato">"tjilka"(prickly) seeds</a> strewn over the ground made walking barefoot difficult. At that point, the Wenamba father drew near, his hands splayed to show he carried no weapons. The 'drifters' spoke a dialect distinct from <a href="Ngaatjatjarra%20dialect">Ngadadjara</a> and Pitjantjatjara, though they could understand the latter. With an amicable rapport established the father then fetched his three-barbed spear, unlike the single barb deployed by the other two tribes.

In 1950, some Wenama were reported to have moved over to the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> to settle at the <a href="Yuendumu">Yuendumu Government Station</a>, and, aftrer a further stay at <a href="Haasts%20Bluff%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Haasts Bluff</a> to have upped stakes and moved back to their traditional lands, preferring to return to their nomadic ways.


Alternative names.

<doc id="54859106" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54859106" title="Juan Noa">
Juan Noa

Juan Noa was the pen-name of John Henry Cleator, a <a href="Manx%20English">Manx dialect</a> poet and playwright active from the 1920s to the 1960s in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>.

Life.
Cleator ran the family drapery business, located at 24 Parliament Street, <a href="Ramsey%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Ramsey</a>. He was married, to Hilda Vondy, and lived at Claughbane. He was a member of the Guild Committee and served on the Ramsey Commissioners for many years. After his retirement, Cleator made frequent trips to visit family in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. It was whilst in America in December 1962 that he fell ill. He returned by air to the Isle of Man and was transferred on a stretcher from the aeroplane to <a href="Noble%E2%80%99s%20Hospital">Noble's Hospital</a> where he died three weeks later on 2 January 1963.

Poetry.
Cleator’s first published poem, 'A Story that's Thrue of a Moddey Dhoo,' appeared in the Ramsey Courier in May 1927 when it appeared under the pen-name of 'Juan Thubm Billy-yn-Clayragh Jonnie.' This and his next poem, 'The Big Buggane', both of which were later to appear in "Manx Yarns", were described in the Manx press as being ‘distinctly spirited, true to the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Manx</a> character and the incidents of Manx country life’ noting that Cleator was ‘a Manx dialect writer of decided talent.’ Also in 1927, Cleator started to enter the <a href="Yn%20Chruinnaght">Yn Chruinnaght</a> competitions, winning the award for the best story in Manx dialect in that year. After successes in Manx dialect classes at Yn Chruinnaght and in performances of his poems, "Manx Yarns" was published in December 1930. A newspaper report described the publication in the following terms:

A delightful book of "Manx Yarns," in verse, breathing the very atmosphere of Manx country life, has just been published from the offices of this paper. The author chooses to hide his identity under the name of "Juan Noa," but many of his friends will recognise his "yarns" as some of the most popular concert items of recent years and it is at the request of these friends that he has had them published. Two of them were recited by Mr Leighton Stowell at Ramsey’s welcome to the Homecomers, and "brought down the house."

Over 30 years later, it was said that the poems of this collection had been 'recited in every village in the Island. No Manx concert would be complete without one of John Cleator’s poems.'

The book originally featured 16 poems, but ‘Isle of Our Fathers’ was also added in reprints made after December 1942. The collection was Cleator’s only published collection of poetry and it features all of his best-known works, including 'Owl Bobby Bob', 'Betsy Juan-y-Voallyah' and 'The Spoot-Vane Moddey-Dhoo'. These poems remain popular pieces for performances at Manx events today, with a recent performance by <a href="Robert%20Corteen%20Carswell">Bob Carswell</a> being recorded at <a href="Maughold%20%28parish%29">Maughold</a> in 2014. Cleator's poems also feature on numerous CDs of Manx dialect recordings, notably "Mostly T. E. Brown" by Laurence Kermode, which features readings of five of Cleator's poems. In contemporary popular Manx culture, the first line of Cleator’s poem, 'Owl' Bobby Bob', features as the refrain of the <a href="Claare%20ny%20Gael">Claare ny Geal</a> programme on <a href="Manx%20Radio">Manx Radio</a>.

Theatre.
Cleator's poetry was frequently performed at gatherings on the Isle of Man alongside other forms of Manx entertainment. Although he was to perform alongside other poets such as <a href="Kathleen%20Faragher">Kathleen Faragher</a>, his closest relationship as a performer was with Leighton Stowell, as a reciter, a performer, actor and as a leader of Manx dancers.

Cleator wrote a number of plays, the most popular of which was "The Raformah". The play's first appearance came at the 1930 Yn Chruinnaght, where it won the Gold Medal.

It was after the 1937 performance of the Ramsey Players in Liverpool (with Leighton Stowell in the role as Tom Keolyah) that the press noted that:

"The Raformah" is, perhaps, the best known and one of the most popular of all Manx plays, and, no matter how often it is presented, people who have seen it before seem to find fresh pleasure in the performance each time.

The play was published in book form in December 1945, it is the only play of Cleator's to have been published.

Cleator's next play was "The Evil One" produced in 1938, with Cleator himself taking one of the roles. This was followed by "The Phynnodderies", first performed by the London Manx Society in London in 1946.

Cleator continued to write Manx dialect theatre into the 1960s, close to the end of his life. A letter to Leighton Stowell in 1960 reveals that at least two new three-act plays on Manx historical themes were finished at that time. These later plays are unpublished and their whereabouts is unknown.

He assisted <a href="Alfred%20Nobel">Alfred Nobel</a> in establishing the original <a href="Nobel%20Enterprises">Nobel Enterprises</a> dynamite factory at Ardeer in Scotland. He was a close colleague of Nobel and probably a close friend.

Life.
He was born in 1839 in central Scotland the son of John N McRoberts and his wife, Sarah Ogle. He was educated at <a href="Falkirk">Falkirk</a> Grammar School.

In 1870 he established a chemical factory at Westquarter in Falkirk, mainly producing sulphuric acid. <a href="Alfred%20Nobel">Alfred Nobel</a> bought the company in 1871 and started making detonators there, mainly for the Scottish coalfields.

The company had its offices at 7 Royal Bank Place in Glasgow. The Chairman of the company was the Glasgow shipbuilder, Charles Randolph.

McRoberts was injured in an explosion during his early years there. He also built a second explosives factory at <a href="Pitsea">Pitsea</a> in Essex in 1876.

Liberty (1986 film)

Liberty is a <a href="television%20film">television film</a> which aired on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> on June 23, 1986. It is a largely fictionalized account of the construction of the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>, which had been completed 100 years earlier.

Scenes were shot on location in Paris and Baltimore.

Plot.
Sculptor <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Auguste%20Bartholdi">Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi</a> (<a href="Frank%20Langella">Frank Langella</a>) and author <a href="%C3%89douard%20Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Laboulaye">Édouard de Laboulaye</a> (<a href="Jean-Pierre%20Cassel">Jean-Pierre Cassel</a>) agree to create a monument to present to the United States on behalf of the French people. Bartholdi searches for a model, approaching (and romancing) young woman Jeanne Baheau (<a href="Corinne%20Touzet">Corinne Touzet</a>) for the body of the statue, and deciding to use his mother (<a href="Claire%20Bloom">Claire Bloom</a>) as a model for its face.

Enlisted to help with its construction are immigrant coppersmith Jacque Marchant (<a href="Chris%20Sarandon">Chris Sarandon</a>), shop owner Seamus Reilly (<a href="George%20Kennedy">George Kennedy</a>), and assistant Robert Johnson (<a href="LeVar%20Burton">LeVar Burton</a>).

Reception.
Reviews of "Liberty" were generally negative. <a href="Jeff%20Jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a> of "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" called it "as pretentious as a high school sophomore trying to act like a college freshman." Clifford Terry of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" described it as "turgid as well as ludicrous, drawing upon the device of meshing fictional and historical characters."

Screenwriter <a href="Pete%20Hamill">Pete Hamill</a> was unhappy with the finished product, and had his name changed to "Robert Malloy" in the credits.

Robert Lynn Pruett

Robert Lynn Pruett (born September 18, 1979), is a <a href="Texas">Texas</a> <a href="death%20row">death row</a> inmate at the <a href="Polunsky%20Unit">Polunsky Unit</a> in Livingston. He was convicted for the 1999 murder of TDCJ Correctional Officer Daniel Nagle (September 9, 1962 - December 17, 1999) at the <a href="McConnell%20Unit">McConnell Unit</a>, <a href="Bee%20County">Bee County</a>. Pruett had been certified as an adult at 16 and was already serving a 99 year sentence for his involvement in the murder of Ray Yarborough, which occurred on August 9, 1995, when he was 15. Pruett was convicted along with Howard Steven "Sam" Pruett, Sr. (born December 13, 1946), his father, who received a life sentence for his participation in the murder, and Howard Steven Pruett, Jr. (born November 22, 1969), his brother, who received a 40-year sentence. Howard Sr. testified that neither son took part in the killing, as did Robert, who was nonetheless convicted under the Texas <a href="Law%20of%20Parties">Law of Parties</a>. Details of both the Yarborough and Nagle murders were featured in the BBC documentary "Life and Death Row - Crisis Stage".

Pruett has also consistently denied involvement in Nagle's murder and his defense attorney has stated that, "What convicted him was the testimony of four or five convicts who received deals, of one kind or another, in exchange for the testimony against Pruett." Pruett has an execution date of Thursday, October 12, 2017, and is scheduled to die by lethal injection at the <a href="Huntsville%20Unit">Huntsville Unit</a>.

Conviction.
A Nueces County jury found Pruett guilty of <a href="capital%20murder">capital murder</a> on April 24, 2002. The only witnesses to Nagle's murder were inmates. Nagle, who was the president of the AFSCME union local that represents McConnell guards, had complained that low pay, high turnover, and poor training of staff were turning Texas prisons into powderkegs. Nagle told supporters at the rally at the Governor's Mansion that "someone would have to be killed" before TDCJ got the message. He was murdered two weeks later. Some Correctional Officers stated that corrupt C.O.s, "dirty bosses" were in league with prison gangs, and that they and their gang associates inside were involved with the murder. There was no physical evidence linking Pruett with the murder, who claims he did not witness or participate in the stabbing of Nagle, who was killed with a prison shank. Weeks after the stabbing, Correctional Officers at the McConnell Unit were indicted for colluding with inmates to traffick drugs. Eliseo Martinez, one of the Correctional Officers interviewed during the investigation into Nagle's death, was arrested in late January 2000 for transporting a package believed to have contained $60,000 in laundered drug profits for inmates. Martinez had said that Pruett told him that he possessed a homemade shank during the investigation.

Pruett is represented by the <a href="Innocence%20Project%20of%20Texas">Texas Innocence Network</a> and has already received 4 stays of execution to allow for further DNA testing. In 2014, his postconviction writ of habeas corpus was denied, but Judges Alcala and Johnson filed a dissenting statement.

In April 2017, Pruett's appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. The ruling that stated that the inconclusive DNA tests wouldn’t have had any effect on his conviction and sentence had they been available during his 2002 trial. Judge Elsa Alcala wrote in a concurring opinion that, "It appears there may be significant problems with the evidence of guilt and with the imposition of the death penalty in this case", and that the, "Court should permit further litigation on appellant’s post-conviction challenges in which he has sought to undermine the validity of his guilt and death sentence".

Pruett has written for inmate blog, Minutes Before Six. Texas inmates are typically executed at 6pm in the Walls Unit.

Henry C. Welles

Henry C. Welles (May 13, 1821 – July 7, 1868) American druggist and business man

Henry Carter Welles is known as one of the founders of <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a>, along with former Union General <a href="John%20B.%20Murray%20%28general%29">John B. Murray</a>. Welles was born in <a href="Glastonbury%2C%20Connecticut">Glastonbury, Connecticut</a> in 1821 to Henry and Sila Welles. She was a distant cousin of her husband and shared the same last name. Henry’s father died when he was young and his mother moved the family to <a href="Waterloo%2C%20New%20York%20%28village%29">Waterloo, New York</a> where her brother Gardner Welles worked as a physician Henry married Josephine Shotwell in 1857 and they had two children, Sterling Hadley Welles and Helen Lavanche Welles, who both died in 1861. Henry was a druggist and business man until he died in Waterloo on July 7, 1868.

Presidential Proclamation.
President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> proclaimed Waterloo the birthplace of the holiday following the passage of House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 587 in 1966. The resolution and proclamation were based on research done by eight members of the community who comprised the Research Committee of the Waterloo Memorial Day Centennial Committee. Their purpose was to promote the centennial of the founding of Memorial Day on May 5, 1866. The holiday was supposedly conceived by Welles who communicated the idea to Murray, the county clerk who helped carry it out.

Myth Exposed.
Almost fifty years after the proclamation, Bellware and Gardiner published "The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America" and call into question the veracity of that claim. According to the research committee, there are no contemporaneous reports of this celebration. Their earliest sources date from 1882, sixteen years after the event. Bellware and Gardiner, however, uncovered evidence that this story was a myth. This evidence includes an earlier report from 1875 in a New York newspaper that describes, in detail, Waterloo’s first Memorial Day and places it in 1868 as well as other inconsistencies between the historical record and the story compiled by the Centennial Committee. They also note a complete lack of discussion or debate by the congressional committee behind HCR 587. There is no evidence that Welles ever actually claimed the honor of being the founder of Memorial Day in his lifetime.

Background.
In the late <a href="Nara%20period">Nara period</a>, after the establishment of a centralized government under the "<a href="Ritsury%C5%8D">Ritsuryō</a>" system, the <a href="Yamato%20dynasty">Yamato court</a> sent a number of military expeditions to what is now the <a href="T%C5%8Dhoku%20region">Tōhoku region</a> of northern Japan to bring the local <a href="Emishi">Emishi</a> tribes under its control.

The site was long believed to have been the location of the castle of the Ōsaki clan, who held the post of <a href="Tandai">Oshu Tandai</a> in the <a href="Muromachi%20period">Muromachi period</a>. However, large quantities of roof tiles had always been uncovered by farmers in nearby fields, and when these case to the attention of archaeologists in the 1980s, it was quickly determined that the remains were actually from the <a href="Nara%20period">Nara period</a>. Subsequent excavation revealed that the site was mostly like a josaku-style Japanese castle dating from the late 7th to early 8th centuries. From its geographic location, the likely candidate is the mentioned in ancient records.It is protected by the central government as a <a href="Historic%20Sites%20of%20Japan">National Historic Site</a>.

Description.
The ruins are located in the northeast of the Osaki plains of northern Miyagi Prefecture, a short distance to the south of the <a href="Daikichiyama%20Tile%20Kiln%20Site">Daikichiyama Tile Kiln Site</a> and several ruined Buddhist temples dating from Nara period. The site consists of the remnants of a square enclosure, approximately 700 meters east-west by 110 meters north-south, with an earthen <a href="Rampart%20%28fortification%29">rampart</a>, presumably surmounted by a wooden <a href="palisade">palisade</a>. Inside the enclosure, post holes and foundation stones indicate the locations of political affairs and ceremonial buildings, and numerous warehouses.

There is nothing to be seen at the site today except for a commemorative stone marker.

Maurice Vinot

Maurice Vinot (3 November 1888 – 22 June 1916), was a French film actor of the early 20th-century whose career ended in 1916 when he was killed in an airplane accident in Pontlevoy, France after enlisting in the military to fight in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. 

Early life and career.
Maurice Vinot was born in in the <a href="11th%20arrondissement%20of%20Paris">11th arrondissement of Paris</a> in 1888. He began his film career as a protégée of director <a href="Louis%20Feuillade">Louis Feuillade</a> in 1908 and would go on to appear in approximately two-hundred motion pictures; the bulk of them being films directed by Feuillade. His first know film role was in the 1908 Feuillade directed short "Le Récit du colonel" opposite actoresses <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Carl">Renée Carl</a> and <a href="Alice%20Tissot">Alice Tissot</a>. Vinot would follow this with a number of other short films released 1908 in roles in directed by Feuillade and again, sharing billing with Carl and Tissot.

Border Police of New South Wales

In 1839, the British colony of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> was expanding rapidly. Settlers with large herds of sheep and cattle were pushing beyond the official limits of location into the grasslands that had been carefully maintained for thousands of years through <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> firestick farming. Conflict with resident Aboriginals and disputes between the pastoralists in these frontier areas forced the NSW government to legislate for a new policing body that would control these issues. This force was called the Border Police. 

The Border Police was organised into a number of sections and these were deployed to the various districts along the frontier. Each section was under the authority of the Commissioner for Crown Lands for that particular district and each commissioner had about 10 troopers to enforce colonial rule. In order to reduce the cost of the force as much as possible, the troopers were taken from the population of convicts that existed in the colony at that time. The convicts assigned were usually ex-soldiers who had been transported to Australia due to crimes of military indiscipline. They were supplied with horses, equipment and rations, but were otherwise unpaid and had to construct their own barracks. The force was funded by a levy imposed on the squatters who were grazing their livestock on the Crown Lands in the frontier regions. Due to the paramilitary nature of the Border Police, conflict with Aboriginals was inevitable and there are multiple instances of mass shootings of Indigenous peoples by this force. With the end of convict transportation to NSW in 1850, the Border Police was dissolved in the late 1840s.

Districts of Operation.
In 1844, the Border Police operated in 15 districts throughout the colony which included areas that are now part of Victoria and Queensland as these colonies were not separated from New South Wales at this stage.
The districts were Maneroo(Monaro), <a href="Murrumbidgee%20District">Murrumbidgee</a>, Lachlan, Wellington, Bligh, Liverpool Plains, New England, Darling Downs, Macleay River, Clarence River, Moreton Bay, Portland Bay, Western Port, Gippsland, Murray.

Abdul Malik Isami

Abdul Malik Isami (1311-?) was a 14th century Indian historian and court poet. He wrote in <a href="Persian%20language">Persian language</a>, under the patronage of <a href="Ala-ud-Din%20Bahman%20Shah">Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah</a>, the founder of the <a href="Bahmani%20Sultanate">Bahmani Sultanate</a>. He is best known for "Futuh-us-Salatin" (c. 1350), a poetic history of the <a href="Muslim%20conquests%20of%20the%20Indian%20subcontinent">Muslim conquest of India</a>.

Early life.
Isami was born in 1311, possibly in <a href="Old%20Delhi">Delhi</a>. His father's name was 'Izz ul-Din 'Isami. His ancestor Fakhr Malik Isami had migrated from <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> to India during the reign of <a href="Iltutmish">Iltutmish</a> (r. 1211–1236).

In 1327, the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a> ruler <a href="Muhammad%20bin%20Tughluq">Muhammad bin Tughluq</a> decided to move his capital from Delhi to <a href="Daulatabad">Daulatabad</a> in Deccan region. Several residents of Delhi, including Isami's family, were ordered to move to Daulatabad. His 90-year old grandfather died during this journey.

In Bahman Shah's service.
At Daulatabad, Isami was appalled with what he perceived as Tughluq's misdeeds and tyranny. At one point, he decided to migrate to Mecca, but he was determined to write a history of Muslim rule in India before leaving the country. He aspired to emulate the famous Persian poet <a href="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</a>, who wrote "<a href="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</a>", an epic poem outlining the history of Persia.

Qazi Bahauddin of Daulatabad introduced him to <a href="Ala-ud-Din%20Bahman%20Shah">Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah</a>, who had rebelled against Tughluq. Bahman Shah, who established the independent <a href="Bahmani%20Sultanate">Bahmani Sultanate</a> in the <a href="Deccan">Deccan</a> region, became Isami's patron. Isami thus became the earliest <a href="panegyrist">panegyrist</a> at the Bahmani court.

Under the patronage of Bahman Shah, he started writing "Futuh-us-Salatin" in 1349. Isami claims to have composed its 12,000 verses in 5 months. According to him, he started writing the book on 10 December 1349, and completed it on 14 May 1350. Nothing is known about Isami's life after this point.

"Futuh-us-Salatin".
The "Futuh-us-Salatin" ("Gifts of the Sultans") is a history of Muslim rule in India until 1349-50. Isami also called it "Shahnama-i Hind" ("the "<a href="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</a>" of India"). According to Isami, his sources included anecdotes, legends, and reports by his friends and acquaintances. Unlike several earlier chronicles, the book's language is devoid of "rhetorical artifices and unpleasant exaggeration".

The book begins with an account of the conquests of the <a href="Ghaznavid">Ghaznavid</a> ruler <a href="Mahmud%20of%20Ghazni">Ghazni</a> (r. 998–1002) and the <a href="Ghurid">Ghurid</a> ruler <a href="Muhammad%20of%20Ghor">Muhammad</a> (r. 1173-1202). It then goes on to narrate the history of the Delhi Sultanate until 1349-50. The book also describes the early years of the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate.

Historical reliability.
"Futuh-us-Salatin" is written in <a href="Mathnawi%20%28poetic%20form%29">masnavi</a> (rhyming poem) style, and is not fully reliable for the purposes of history. It contains factual mistakes and omits several important events. In addition, Isami implies that the various historical events were <a href="predeterminism">pre-determined</a> by <a href="divine%20will">divine will</a> and <a href="destiny">destiny</a>. He believed that the presence of spiritually powerful <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> leaders had an impact on the fortunes of a kingdom. For example, he attributes to the decline of the Delhi Sultanate to the death of the Sufi saint <a href="Nizamuddin%20Auliya">Nizamuddin Auliya</a>. Similarly, he claims that the Deccan region prospered because <a href="Burhanuddin%20Gharib">Burhanuddin Gharib</a> and his successor <a href="Zainuddin%20Shirazi">Zainuddin Shirazi</a> lived in Daulatabad.

Isami is highly critical of Muhammad bin Tughluq. On the other hand, he calls his patron Bahman Shah as the rightful <a href="caliph">caliph</a>. He claims that Tughluq forced the "entire" population of Delhi to move to Daulatabad, and that only 10% of the migrants survived the journey. Both these claims appear to be exaggerations. According to Isami, this unfortunate situation was a result of God's punishment to the corrupt Muslims.

Despite these defects, Isami's book is a valuable source of information about the political history and social life of 14th century India.

Authentic Renewal Organization

The Authentic Renewal Organization (ORA) is an <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> and <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> political party in Venezuela, originally founded in 1988 by Godofredo Marín and Carlos Mendez as the first Evangelical political party there.

The party considers that Christianity is not a political ideology of the left, right, or center and that its form of government would be under the "sacred and noble Christian principles of love, peace, faith and hope, but above all the Love of God and neighbor, tolerance, religious freedom and political pluralism." It also promotes participatory and pro-active democracy and a state-religion-neighbor alliance that does not work exclusively for Christians but with "pluralist Christology."

History.
In his first electoral participation, the party nominated one of the founders, Godofredo Ramón Marín, as a candidate in the general elections of 1988. The electoral promise of the party was based on "governing Venezuela for five years according to the Evangelical Bible," but the party and the candidate did not obtain the results expected to be in the fourth place with 0.87% of the votes. However, the organization obtained two seats in the Chamber of Deputies of the Congress of the Republic. The deputies who were elected at that time, Mr. Gabriel Niño Laguado, representative of the Zulia State and Dr. Modesto Rivero, for the Federal District, now the Capital District. In 1993 ORA obtained a position by the Federal District in the Chamber of Deputies.

In 1998 the party came into conflict when one sector decided to support the candidacy of Claudio Fermin to the Presidency of the Republic and the other led by the party's president, Godofredo Marín, resolved to support the candidate of the Democratic Action party Luis Alfaro Ucero. Finally the latter is registered but the leadership of his party decides, later, to withdraw the support for which his nomination lost force, obtaining only 0.38% of the votes, of which ORA contributed 0.11%. That fact caused a fracture of the party making difficult its options for the general elections of 2000, in which they did not run for presidential candidate nor obtained seats in the then newly installed National Assembly.

Its last political participation was also in 1998, after this, the inscription of the political grouping was canceled by the National Electoral Council for not having fulfilled its leaders of that time with its process of renovation which led to the extinction of ORA like political party. 

Revival of ORA.
In 2010, political leader Luis Reyes Castillo, until then General Secretary of the YOUNG political party, establishes ORA not as a political party, but as a "Christian, social and political movement" that in a period of two years fulfilled the requirements demanded by the National Electoral Council, for which it was reinscribed. In 2012, Luis Reyes Castillo launched his candidacy for the Presidency of the Republic by this party and reaches the sum of 8,212 votes, which represented 0.05% of registered voters. Former political leader Juan Gonzalez, one of the founders of the original party in 1987, accused Reyes Castillo of kidnapping this political organization and its acronyms. According to González, Reyes Castillo discovered that ORA lacked leadership and resigned the General Secretariat of his then-party, the YOUNG political movement, to reorganize the ORA party, without consulting its founders. In the elections of 14 of April of 2013, after the death of President Hugo Chávez, the party supported the candidate candidate and acting president Nicolas Maduro. This support is still maintained today, although the organization has submitted its own candidates for the municipal elections in Venezuela to be held on December 8, 2013.

<doc id="54861290" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54861290" title="Ruby (1800 ship)">
Ruby (1800 ship)

Ruby was launched at <a href="Kolkatta">Calcutta</a>, probably in 1800 but possibly in 1797. She participated in the expedition to the Red Sea and made one voyage for the British <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>. Although she took on British Registry, she probably sailed in Indian waters. She was probably lost in 1813, but possibly in 1818 or 1820.

Career.
"Ruby" sailed from <a href="Ambon%20Island">Ambonya</a> on 23 February 1800 and anchored at <a href="Sulu">Sulu</a> on 15 March. The next morning Captain Pavin of "Ruby" went ashore n the jolly boat with seven crew members. About an hour later five <a href="proa">proa</a>s, armed with 9-pounder brass guns in their bows took up positions three on one side of "Ruby" and two on the other. The proas held off until 5 PM when three shore batteries started firing on "Ruby". The mate was able to cut her cables and get her underway. She held her fire but eventually had to engage the batteries and the proas which were making to board. "Ruby" was able to silence her attackers. She had one man wounded and some damage from the enemy's fire. The mate sailed to <a href="Manado">Manada</a>, where he reported to the British resident. "Ruby" then sailed to Amourang (Amurang) Bay (about 30 miles southwest of Manada; ). There she gathered a cargo of rice that she delivered to Ambonya. Later, when "Apollo" visited Sulu, Captain Porter received Pavin's hat and the jolly boat, and the information that Pavin and his men had been hacked to death.
"Ruby" appears among the "country ships" that served as transports or troop ships to support Major-General <a href="Sir%20David%20Baird%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir David Baird</a>'s expedition in 1800 to the Red Sea. Baird was in command of the Indian army that was going to Egypt to help General <a href="Ralph%20Abercromby">Ralph Abercromby</a> expel the <a href="France">French</a> from there. Baird landed at <a href="Al-Qusayr%2C%20Egypt">Kosseir</a>, on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea. He then led his troops across the desert to <a href="Qena">Kena</a> on the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>, and then to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. He arrived before <a href="Battle%20of%20Alexandria%20%281801%29">Alexandria</a> in time for the final operations. "Ruby" received her provisions and sailed on 31 March 1801 for the Red Sea. She also called in at Al-Qusayr in August. "Ruby" was under the command of Fraser Sinclair, but he left her after her return from the Red Sea.

Captain John Hitchings sailed "Ruby" from Calcutta on 26 January 1803, bound for England. She was a <a href="Sagar%20Island">Saugor</a> o 8 February, reached <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> on 12 May, and arrived at Portsmouth on 24 July. While she was in English waters a <a href="impressment">press gang</a> from a British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> ship came up and removed some of her crew, further burdening a crew that was already spending much of their time on the pumps dealing with leaks.

"Ruby" was admitted to the Registry of Great Britain on 26 January 1804. On 26 March "Ruby" Captain Blake, sailed down the River Thames, bound for India.

"Ruby" first appears in "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" for 1806 with Blake, maser, Capt. & Co., owners, and trade London—India.

This entry, uninformative as it is concerning "Ruby"s actual actual voyages, continues unchanged through 1813, which is the last year in which she is listed in either "Lloyd's Register" or the "Register of Shipping". There is no record of "Ruby" having made any more voyages for the EIC, and the EIC still had a monopoly on trade between England and India and China. It is, therefore, most probable that "Ruby" sailed as a London-registered "country ship", i.e., only within the Far East.

Fate.
"Ruby" is on an 1814 list as one of several vessels built in India but later under British Registry and known to be "Lost, burnt, or taken". However, another source has her lost on the Sandheads in July 1818, or 1820.

351st Rifle Division (Soviet Union)

The 351st Rifle Division first formed in September, 1941, as a standard <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> rifle division, at <a href="Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a>. It was assigned to the newly-formed 57th Army in the same area shortly after forming, and remained in that Army for the duration of its existence. It helped to carve out the bridgehead north of Rostov known as the Izium Salient, but was encircled and destroyed during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Kharkov">Second Battle of Kharkov</a>. A second 351st began forming in July, 1942 in the North Caucasus, and went into combat in October, liberating the town of <a href="Alagir">Alagir</a> in January, 1943. During the rest of that year and on into 1944 the division participated in the liberation of Ukraine under several Corps and Army headquarters and under command of a bewildering series of divisional commanders until Maj. Gen. I.F. Dudarev took command in April, 1944, and held the post for just over a year. During its second formation the division compiled an enviable record of service and was recognized with several unit decorations and honors, but was disbanded shortly after the end of hostilities in Europe.

1st Formation.
The division began forming in September, 1941, in the <a href="North%20Caucasus%20Military%20District">North Caucasus Military District</a> at Stalingrad. Its basic order of battle was as follows:
The first recorded commander of the division was Col. N.U. Gursky, but he was not appointed until April 1, 1942. He would lead this formation of the division until it was disbanded. The division's personnel included a large number of non-Russian nationality. In October, while still barely formed, the division was assigned to <a href="57th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">57th Army</a>, which was also just in the process of forming-up in the <a href="Reserve%20of%20the%20Supreme%20High%20Command">Reserve of the Supreme High Command</a>, also in the Stalingrad area. In January, 1942, the division and its Army moved to join <a href="Southern%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Southern Front</a>, taking part in the winter counter-offensive which led to the creation of the <a href="Izium">Izium</a> salient south of <a href="Kharkov">Kharkov</a>. In the course of this offensive, the 351st liberated the town of <a href="Barvinkove">Barvenkovo</a>, but the offensive became overextended and bogged down in the spring <a href="rasputitsa">rasputitsa</a> soon after.

Second Battle of Kharkov.
When <a href="Southwestern%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Southwestern Front</a> launched its offensive on Kharkov on May 11, Southern Front's forces were not directly involved, but 57th Army was deep inside the Izium salient from which Southwestern Front was staging the southern prong of its attack. The Army was holding a front of 80km with four divisions, including the 351st, in the first line with <a href="14th%20Guards%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">14th Guards Rifle Division</a> in reserve. The divisions averaged a strength of 6,000 to 7,000 men. The 351st was on the Army's eastern (left) flank, linking to <a href="9th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">9th Army</a> and mostly facing the German <a href="1st%20Mountain%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">1st Mountain Division</a>. Over the coming days <a href="Army%20Group%20South">Army Group South</a> staged a buildup of forces south of the salient, and on May 17, 9th Army (due east of the division) came under attack from the German <a href="III%20Panzer%20Corps">III Motorized</a> and <a href="XXXXIV%20Army%20Corps%20%28Wehrmacht%29">XXXXIV Army Corps</a>.

On the first day of the German counteroffensive, 9th Army's front was deeply penetrated: A breach 20km wide had been torn in the defenses between the two armies. The next day, Podlas was killed in action, and his army became leaderless during this crisis. Up to May 21 the division continued to hold most of its ground while being slowly driven backwards, but was not given explicit orders to retreat until the German forces completed its encirclement on that date. Over the following days the division was defending Krasnopavlovka, acting as a rearguard for the rest of the Army's remnants as they attempted to break out of the pocket. This duty gave little hope to escape themselves, and although the division held together well under such circumstances, it was destroyed by May 27, and was officially disbanded the same day.

2nd Formation.
A new 351st Rifle Division began forming from July until August 9, 1942, at <a href="Vladikavkaz">Ordzhonikidze</a> in the North Caucasus Military District. Its basic order of battle remained the same as the first formation. Its initial commander was Col. I.G. Vinogradov, but he was replaced within a month by Maj. Gen. V.F. Sergatzkov, who would remain in command until January 14, 1943. For the duration of the war, the division was commanded by the following officers:

While still forming the division had to be moved south into the reserves of <a href="Transcaucasus%20Front">Transcaucasus Front</a> since the German forces were approaching Ordzhonikidze. 

Battle of the Caucasus.
The division was originally intended for the newly-forming <a href="66th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">66th Army</a>, but due to the growing crisis in the Caucasus this plan was shelved. In mid-August, the German <a href="17th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">17th Army</a> began trying to force the passes through the High Caucasus mountains to reach the coast of the Black Sea. The division was assigned to <a href="46th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">46th Army</a> in the Black Sea Group of Forces with orders to organize a credible defense of the <a href="Ossetian%20Military%20Road">Ossetian Military Road</a> and the pass it traverses. In the event, this pass was not contested. On September 23, Army Group A made another attempt to take the Black Sea port of Tuapse; at this time 46th Army was facing First Panzer Army's XXXIX Mountain Corps.

In October the 351st left 46th Army and was assigned to <a href="12th%20Rifle%20Corps">12th Rifle Corps</a> under direct command of the Front until December. In the first days of November, III Panzer Corps was struggling towards Ordzhonikidze, but on the 5th the city's defenders definitively halted <a href="13th%20Panzer%20Division">13th Panzer Division</a> on the western and northwestern outskirts. A counterstroke was planned for November 7, the anniversary of the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>, and the division, along with the <a href="276th%20Rifle%20Division">276th Rifle Division</a> and 155th Rifle Brigade, was tasked to penetrate the southern wing of the panzer corps' defenses and link up with another assault group attacking from the north. These attacks went off piecemeal, which lessened their impact; despite this, <a href="23rd%20Panzer%20Division">23rd Panzer Division</a> was forced to withdraw and 13th Panzer was encircled near Gizel, northwest of Ordzhonikidze. Over the next days, Army Group A's overextended forces fought to rescue the beleaguered division, eventually linking up through a narrow corridor on November 11. Had the 351st acted more decisively the panzer troops might have been destroyed, but it held to its defensive positions in Mamisoiskii Pass, just south of the escape route, protecting the Ossetian Military Road.

In December the division left 12th Corps and joined the <a href="37th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">37th Army</a> in the Northern Group of Forces in Transcaucasus Front, and on January 24, 1943, it liberated the town of Alagir. By the end of the month it was transferred to <a href="58th%20Army%20%28Russia%29">58th Army</a> in the <a href="North%20Caucasus%20Front">North Caucasus Front</a>, and after April it was moved to 9th Army of the same front, facing the German 17th Army in the <a href="Kuban%20bridgehead">Kuban bridgehead</a>. After the Germans finally evacuated this last pocket in the Caucasus in September, the 351st went into the <a href="Reserve%20of%20the%20Supreme%20High%20Command">Reserve of the Supreme High Command</a>, in the <a href="1st%20Guards%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">1st Guards Army</a>.

Into Ukraine and Czechoslovakia.
In November, the division was transferred, along with its Army, to <a href="1st%20Ukrainian%20Front">1st Ukrainian Front</a>, and the following month moved to <a href="60th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">60th Army</a> in the same Front.
On February 11, 1944, the division was recognized for its role in the liberation of the western Ukrainian city of <a href="Shepetivka">Shepetovka</a> and received its name as a battle honor: Kozik led the division until March 14, when he was replaced. He would later command the <a href="327th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">327th Rifle Division</a>. In that same month the division was assigned to <a href="11th%20Rifle%20Corps">11th Rifle Corps</a> in <a href="1st%20Tank%20Army">1st Tank Army</a>, but in April that Corps was reassigned to <a href="18th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">18th Army</a> in the same Front. Within a few weeks it left that Corps and served under direct Army command through the early summer, until it was assigned the <a href="95th%20Rifle%20Corps">95th Rifle Corps</a> in July. It would remain under that command for the duration.

In August, 18th Army was moved to the re-deployed <a href="4th%20Ukrainian%20Front">4th Ukrainian Front</a>; the 351st would remain in that Front for the duration. In January, 1945, 95th Corps became a separate corps under Front command, before being assigned to <a href="38th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">38th Army</a> in February. The Corps was reassigned once again in April, and the division ended its combat path back in 1st Guards Army, advancing on Prague.

Postwar.
The division completed its wartime service with the distinguished full title of "351st Rifle, Shepetovka, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Red%20Banner">Order of the Red Banner</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20Suvorov">Order of Suvorov</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20Bogdan%20Khmelnitsky%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky</a> Division". [Russian: 351-я стрелковая Шепетовская Краснознамённая орденов Суворова и Богдана Хмельницкого дивизия.] The division was disbanded in mid-1945 with the <a href="Northern%20Group%20of%20Forces">Northern Group of Forces</a>.

<doc id="54861610" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54861610" title="Mongol invasion of India, 1303">
Mongol invasion of India, 1303

In 1303, a <a href="Mongols">Mongol</a> army from the <a href="Chagatai%20Khanate">Chagatai Khanate</a> invaded the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>, when two major units of the Delhi army were away from the city. The Delhi Sultan <a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a>, who was away at <a href="Chittor">Chittor</a> when the Mongols started their march, returned to Delhi in a hurry. However, he was unable to make adequate war preparations, and decided to take shelter in a well-guarded camp at the under-construction <a href="Siri%20Fort">Siri Fort</a>. The Mongols, led by Taraghai, besieged Delhi for over two months, and ransacked its suburbs. Ultimately, they decided to retreat, having been unable to breach Alauddin's camp.

The invasion was one of the most serious <a href="Mongol%20invasions%20of%20India">Mongol invasions of India</a>, and prompted Alauddin to take several measures to prevent its recurrence. He strengthened military presence along the Mongol routes to India, and implemented economic reforms to ensure adequate revenue streams for maintaining a strong army.

Background.
<a href="Alauddin%20Khilji">Alauddin Khilji</a>, the ruler of the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">Delhi Sultanate</a>, had successfully warded off <a href="Mongols">Mongol</a> (Mughal) invasions from the <a href="Chagatai%20Khanate">Chagatai Khanate</a> and its neighbours in <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20India%2C%201297-98">1297-98</a>, <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20India%2C%201298-99">1298-99</a> and <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20India%2C%201299">1299</a>. In the winter of 1302-1303, Alauddin dispatched an army to conquer <a href="Warangal">Warangal</a>, while he himself led another army to conquer <a href="Chittor%20Fort">Chittor</a>. When the Mongols came to know that two large units of the imperial army were absent from Delhi, they decided to capture the city. The Mongol army was led by Taraghai (also Turghai; sometimes incorrectly transliterated as "Targhi"). Taraghai had earlier served as a general in the 1299 invasion led by <a href="Qutlugh%20Khwaja">Qutlugh Khwaja</a>.

According to the 14th century chronicler <a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Ziauddin Barani</a>, the Mongol army comprised "30,000 or 40,000" horsemen. Some manuscripts of Barani's writings give the number as "20,000 or 30,000". The Mongols marched through <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab</a> without meeting much resistance. The Delhi Sultanate forces stationed at <a href="Multan">Multan</a>, <a href="Dipalpur">Dipalpur</a>, and <a href="Samana%2C%20Punjab">Samana</a> were not strong enough to check the Mongol advance, or to proceed to Delhi and help Alauddin.

Meanwhile, Alauddin captured Chittor in August 1303, and appointed his own governor there. He left Chittor 7 days after the conquest, probably when he learned about the Mongol plans.

Alauddin's preparations.
Alauddin reached Delhi around a month before the Mongols did, but he was unable to make adequate preparations for the impending battle. The weapons of his army had been ruined in the rainy season, during the Siege of Chittor. Plus, he had not been able to replace the horses and the materials that his army had lost in Chittor.

Alauddin sent messages to his provincial governors, ordering them to send reinforcements to Delhi. However, the Mongols had set up blockades on all the roads leading to Delhi. The merchant <a href="caravan%20%28travellers%29">caravans</a> were also forced to stop, leading to the scarcity of goods in Delhi.

The army that Alauddin had sent to capture Warangal had abandoned its mission, and had reached close to Delhi after a long journey. But it had lost several men and its baggage in the process. Moreover, it could not enter Delhi, because by this time, the Mongols had captured the <a href="ford%20%28crossing%29">fords</a> of the <a href="Yamuna%20River">Yamuna River</a>. Despite Alauddin's summons to come to Delhi, this army was forced to halt at <a href="Kol%20Tehsil">Koil</a> (Aligarh) and <a href="Bulandshahr">Bulandshahr</a>, which are located to the south-east of Delhi.

Given these difficult circumstances, Alauddin decided to avoid a personal confrontation with the Mongols. He exited the fortified city of Delhi, and set up his royal camp at the under-construction <a href="Siri%20Fort">Siri</a>. Siri was surrounded by the Yamuna River, a dense jungle, and the old <a href="citadel">citadel</a> of Delhi: it was vulnerable only at its north side. Alauddin ordered a ditch to be dug around his Siri camp. The ditch, in turn, was protected by a wooden <a href="rampart%20%28fortification%29">rampart</a> built from the doors of Delhi's houses. This temporary settlement was guarded by several contingents of armed soldiers, with each contingent having five fully armed <a href="war%20elephants">elephants</a> in its front.

Mongol investment of Delhi.
The Mongols faced the <a href="vanguard">vanguard</a> of the Delhi army two or three times. Neither side achieved a decisive victory in these conflicts, and the Mongols were unable to enter Alauddin's Siri camp.

Although repulsed from Siri, the Mongols proceeded to other parts of the present-day Delhi. Barani names these parts as Chautara-i Subhani, Mori, Hudhudi and the royal tank ("Hauz-i Sultani"). The modern identity of these areas is not certain; "Hauz-i Sultani" probably refers to <a href="Hauz-i-Shamsi">Hauz-i-Shamsi</a>. The Mongols also ransacked the royal stores, and sold corn and other commodities from it to the public at a cheap rate.

The invaders spent two months in and around Delhi, but were unable to breach Alauddin's Siri camp. Taraghai realized that further stay in hostile territory would put his army in a precarious situation. Therefore, he decided to return with the plunder he had gathered until that point. Taraghai's return might have also been influenced by the conflict between <a href="Duwa">Duwa</a> and Chapar in his home country. A later fabrication claims that Taraghai retreated as a result of the prayers of the Sufi saint <a href="Nizamuddin%20Auliya">Nizamuddin Auliya</a>.

<a href="Ziauddin%20Barani">Ziauddin Barani</a>, who was a resident of Delhi at that time, later wrote that the city had never witnessed such fear of Mongols. According to him, if Taraghai had decided to stay in Delhi for another month, the city would have fallen to him.

Aftermath.
Before the Mongol invasion of 1303, Alauddin had personally led many expeditions and sieges. However, Taraghai's near-conquest of Delhi made him more careful. Subsequently, nearly all his campaigns (with the exception of <a href="Siwana">Siwana</a>) were led by his generals (such as <a href="Malik%20Kafur">Malik Kafur</a>). Alauddin himself stayed at Siri, where he built a palace. Siri (then a town outside the fortified city of Delhi) thus became the capital of the Delhi Sultanate, and its population increased rapidly. Alauddin also had the old fort wall of Delhi repaired.

To weaken the Mongol threat, Alauddin strengthened the military presence along the Mongol routes to India. He had several old forts repaired and new ones built along this route. Powerful "<a href="kotwal">kotwal</a>s" (fort commanders) with an increased number of soldiers were assigned to these forts. The armouries and stores of these forts were replenished. A large army was deployed at the <a href="Dipalpur">Dipalpur</a> and <a href="Samana%2C%20Punjab">Samana</a>. Besides, the <a href="iqta%27">iqta'</a>s on the Mongol frontier were assigned to efficient and experienced noblemen and army officers.

Alauddin also implemented a series of economic reforms. Barani suggests that his main objective was to ensure sufficient revenue inflows for the maintenance of a strong army to deal with the Mongol threat.

These measures did not prevent the Mongols from invading India, but ensured that the invaders were decisively defeated in their further attempts to invade Alauddin's territory.

Abdourahmane Sarr

Abdourahmane Sarr, (born 26 March 1968) in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, is a Senegalese economist and politician who is the leader of the Movement for Rebirth, Liberty and Development (MRLD) - Moom sa Bopp, Mënël sa Bopp, a Senegalese social movement created in 2011,and the head of the Center for Local Economic Development Financing (CEFDEL), a <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a> founded in 2010.

Early life.
Born in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, Abdourahmane Sarr was raised in <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, in a family that hails from <a href="Kaolack">Kaolack</a>. He was educated mostly at the Collège de la Cathédrale in Dakar before attending the Sainte Jeanne d'Arc Institute. He moved to <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> in 1986 to do his undergraduate studies at <a href="C%C3%A9gep%20Marie-Victorin">Cégep Marie-Victorin</a> and <a href="HEC%20Montr%C3%A9al">HEC Montréal</a>, obtaining a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Business%20Administration">BBA</a> in <a href="finance">finance</a> and <a href="economics">economics</a>. He then obtained a master's degree and a doctorate in economics at the <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a>.

Professional career.
In 1997, Sarr began his career as an economist at the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> in the Economist Program, later becoming senior economist in 2005. A monetary affairs specialist, Sarr worked on or led many missions in various countries such as <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>, <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>, <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> on macroeconomic, monetary and finance-related issues. He also served as the IMF's macroeconomic advisor to the <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20West%20African%20States">Central Bank of West African States</a> (BCEAO) from 2005 to 2007. In 2009, he became the Resident Representative of the IMF in Togo and Benin.

In October 2011, Sarr resigned from the IMF to go to Senegal and devote himself to the Center for Local Economic Development Financing (CEFDEL), a think tank he founded in 2010 and was sponsoring from Togo. He subsequently created the Movement for Rebirth, Liberty and Development (MRLD) in 2011. The numerous studies carried out at the CEFDEL provided him with a diagnostic of the socioeconomic situation in Senegal and urged him to declare his candidacy for the <a href="Senegalese%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">2012 Senegalese presidential election</a> to share his vision with his compatriots.

2012 Senegalese presidential bid.
Sarr was certain that he had innovative and practical solutions to his country's developmental problems, and managed to bring together Senegalese from all walks of life (<a href="entrepreneurship">entrepreneurs</a>, <a href="teachers">teachers</a>, community leaders, youth, etc.) to join in support of his movement and to promote ideals of <a href="decentralization">decentralization</a> and of local economic and political empowerment consistent with values of <a href="liberty">liberty</a> and <a href="autonomy">autonomy</a>. During the end of the year 2011, these ideals were promoted through community representative trainings and <a href="rallies">rallies</a> held in cities throughout the country, such as <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, <a href="Saint-Louis%2C%20Senegal">Saint-Louis</a>, <a href="Kaolack">Kaolack</a>, <a href="Ziguinchor">Ziguinchor</a> and <a href="Thi%C3%A8s">Thiès</a>. The movement gathered 12,100 signatures to endorse its campaign, but Sarr's candidacy was invalidated by the Constitutional Court, despite the fact that the 10,000 signature submission requirement had been met. According to the Constitutional Court, only 8,100 signatures were valid. Famous Senegalese singer <a href="Youssou%20N%27Dour">Youssou N'Dour</a> and <a href="financier">financier</a> Kéba Keindé met the same fate. Despite this setback, the movement and its leader continued the strategic thinking process and worked on raising awareness within the country, with the help of the CEFDEL.
In June 2012, Sarr returned to the United States to continue to reflect on the development issues of Senegal by attending <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. He was admitted to the <a href="Edward%20Sagendorph%20Mason">Edward S. Mason</a> program at the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20School%20of%20Government">John F. Kennedy School of Government</a>, where he obtained a <a href="Master%20of%20Public%20Administration">master's degree in public administration</a>. Many world leaders, such as former <a href="President%20of%20Mexico">Mexican president</a> <a href="Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n">Felipe Calderón</a> and current <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Singapore">Prime Minister of Singapore</a> <a href="Lee%20Hsien%20Loong">Lee Hsien Loong</a>, attended this program. After spending a year at Harvard, Sarr returned to Senegal with the intention to implement his long-held vision.

Creation of SOFADEL.
In order to effectively implement his solutions, Sarr founded the Local Development Trust Company (SOFADEL) in 2013, to enable Senegalese people from all walks of life to seize the economic opportunities available to them and to enable them to build up economic and financial wealth. For this to happen, he brought about a solution never-before-seen in Africa: the creation of a national <a href="complementary%20currency">complementary currency</a> named SEN that would complement the <a href="CFA%20franc">CFA franc</a>. Due to collateral problems and to the limited number of Senegalese people that have access to banking services (90% of the population is unbanked), it is difficult to achieve financial inclusion, hence Sarr's desire to see the solutions provided by SOFADEL implemented. Members of SOFADEL would buy SENs and use them in their day-to-day transactions as a means of exchange within their respective cities, thus enabling SOFADEL to establish an investment and guarantee fund in CFA francs, that would not only represent a collective guarantee to SOFADEL members, but would also help the company facilitate access to credit in SENs and invest in its members' respective communities.

In 2014, over 3,000 members were recruited, as well as distributors, and SOFADEL was ready to begin its activities. However, in early 2015, Senegalese authorities and the BCEAO blocked the project and collaborators were imprisoned in Ziguinchor. Despite the existence and benefits of complementary currencies in numerous countries throughout the world (<a href="WIR">WIR</a> in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <a href="Eusko">Eusko</a> in <a href="France">France</a>, etc.) the Senegalese government opposed the project's implementation. Nevertheless, this second setback did not stop Abdourahmane Sarr, as he continued to work on the MRLD and the CEFDEL for two years. Given the situation, he felt he had no other choice but to reenter the political arena and to participate in the <a href="Senegalese%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202017">2017 Senegalese parliamentary election</a> to convince people to vote for the MRLD and to lift the ban on the project.

2017 parliamentary election.
The movement had to gather over 30,000 signatures to participate in the 2017 parliamentary elections as an independent entity. Defar Senegal, a movement led by journalist Mamadou Sy Tounkara was the other independent entity in contention at the election. Sarr headed the movement's list of candidates and led the campaign during the month of July; it was an unprecendented parliamentary election campaign for Senegal, with 47 lists in contention for seats in parliament. The campaign was marked by clashes between militants of the three big coalitions (<a href="Macky%20Sall">President Macky Sall</a>'s Benno Bokk Yakaar, former president <a href="Abdoulaye%20Wade">Abdoulaye Wade</a>'s Gagnante Wattu Sénégal and Mankoo Taxawu Sénégal led by the mayor of Dakar, <a href="Khalifa%20Sall">Khalifa Sall</a>, who has been incarcerated since January 2017. 

Sarr and the MRLD obtained over 4,000 votes in the election, showing how difficult it is for independents to be heard and listened to by the people of Senegal. Despite its low vote count, the movement represented an alternative for all voters who fail to identify with the ideals of the traditional political class of the last 57 years, and was able to share its vision of autonomy, liberty and responsibility, as well as its flagship legislative proposal which is the introduction of the SEN as a national complementary currency. The movement will continue to give voice to its message for the future.

Emergency medical services in Finland

Emergency medical services in Finland (staggered primary care system) is a service network for people with acute health problems. The idea of the system is to take the required level of research and treatment at the time, to the patient's place of illness or injuries. The chain of care begins at the Emergency Center, which assesses the patient's risk of illness or disability, and then triggers proper units to the patient. After the studies carried out by the emergency care staff and the effect of any given treatment, an assessment is made as to whether the patient needs further investigation and treatment at the hospital. If necessary, the patient is directed to an appropriate nursing institution, in an appropriate manner. For example, a car or taxi may be used, and the patient handed over to the emergency care unit. In the continuing care center, the primary care is supplemented and transferred to the acute care phase of the nursing institution.

In Finland, ambulances have been arranged through the Six Step model in its entirety. The system includes:

Each level has its own role as part of a progressive first aid system. Personally working people are given the means of action personally on the basis of basic training and a periodic quality test. Accepted at a higher level may work in a lower level unit, but as a rule, for example, an approved base person can not work at the care level.

Based on the risk assessment of the Emergency Response Center, a basic or therapeutic unit can be provided by a single or multiple-level unit.

BDO or Binder Dijker Otte is an international network of public <a href="accounting">accounting</a>, tax, consulting and business advisory firms which perform professional services under the name of BDO. , BDO has member firms in 154 countries, employs around 68,000 partners and staff in over 1,400 offices throughout the world, and is the fifth largest professional services network globally.

Global Fee income of all BDO Member Firms for the year ended 30 September 2016 totalled US$7.6 billion. In October 2015, BDO was announced as the winner of the Network of the Year award at the International Accounting Bulletin (IAB) Awards 2015.

Each BDO member firm is an independent legal entity in its own country. The network, originally formed in 1963 as Binder Seidman International by firms from Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, UK and US, is coordinated by BDO Global Coordination <a href="Besloten%20Vennootschap">B.V.</a>, with an office in <a href="Zaventem%2C%20Belgium">Zaventem, Belgium</a>. The name BDO, first devised in 1973, is an abbreviation for Binder Dijker Otte & Co.

In early 2012, it was reported that BDO has been expanding in China rapidly. It has 7,500-8,000 staff in mainland China and Hong Kong, making it the second largest headcount after the U.S.A., where it employs 11,500. According to its global chairman, the Chinese headcount is likely to overtake in three to four years.

History.

Awards.
BDO is viewed as a major challenger to the 'Big Four' accountancy practices. It has done this by being vociferous in the lack of competition for accounting services in the large corporate market and by developing its own culture.

This has been publicly recognised by the following awards:

Criticism.
BDO Stoy Hayward was criticised in their role as administrators for the collapsed Christmas hamper savings company <a href="Farepak">Farepak</a>. BDO Stoy Hayward used an <a href="0870">0870</a> non-geographic phone service (termed by some "premium rate") to provide information for victims of Farepak's collapse. The criticism was at least partially based on the mistaken belief that BDO Stoy Hayward were taking a share of the call revenue to pay for the administration; this incorrect belief was later corrected by "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>".

Northern Rock.
In September 2008, Andrew Caldwell, valuations partner at BDO Stoy Hayward, was appointed independent valuer for the stricken mortgage bank, <a href="Northern%20Rock">Northern Rock</a> plc. The UK government nationalised Northern Rock in February 2008, and the legislation effecting the nationalisation required an independent valuer to ascertain the value of the business at the point of nationalisation. The role is a controversial one, as the legislation specifies in some detail the basis of valuation, and shareholder action groups claim that the valuation basis has been designed to minimise the compensation due.

Kento Itohara

Early Baseball Career.
Born and raised in Unnan City, Kento started playing ball in 2nd grade. In his 1st year in Shimane Kaisei High, he recorded hits in 9 consecutive at bats in the Chuugoku regional tournaments. His school made it to the <a href="Japanese%20High%20School%20Baseball%20Championship">Koshien national tournaments</a> in his 2nd and 3rd year. In their 1st round match against Sendai Ikuei High, despite hitting what would've been a winning 2-base hit in the 9th inning when they were just a point behind, the opposing defense caught Kento's hit and ended the game. He hit a total of 29 home runs in high school. 

He entered <a href="Meiji%20University">Meiji University</a> and was a regular starter in the <a href="Tokyo%20Big6%20Baseball%20League">Tokyo Big6 Baseball League</a>. He was awarded Best Nine as a 3rd baseman in his 3rd year. He helped his team finish as runner ups in the Meiji Jingu Baseball Tournament in his 3rd and 4th year. In 71 league games, he recorded a batting average of 0.229, 33 RBIs and 1 home run. He was one year ahead of soon-to-be Hanshin teammates <a href="Shun%20Takayama">Shun Takayama</a> and <a href="Seishir%C5%8D%20Sakamoto">Seishirō Sakamoto</a>.

When he went undrafted after graduation, he joined the Industrial Leagues under JX-ENEOS for two years. He debuted with a walk off hit, and finished his first season with .330 BA, and got to participate in the intercity tournaments. While his team didn't make it the following year, he joined Toshiba's team as a loaned player, and still got to play in the tournament, but didn't make it all the way to the championships.

Hanshin Tigers.
He was the Tiger' 5th pick at the <a href="2016%20Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball%20draft">2016 NPB Draft</a>. He signed with the Tigers for a contract of 50 million yen, and an annual salary of 8 million. He was given the jersey number 33.

2017

He joined the main roster during spring training, and competed with Hiroki Uemoto for the 2nd base post during the pre-season games.
He debuted on as a pinch hitter in the 6th inning during the April 1st game against the Carps in Mazda Stadium. He continued as a shortstop from then on, but Hanshin lost the game 9-8 due to a fielding error he committed in the 10th inning. On the next day, he recorded his 1st hit on his 3rd at-bat from Carp pitcher Ryan Brasier. 

He made it to the starting line up as shortstop/7th batter on April 14, and from then on, alternated between being a pinch hitter and starter. His starts gradually increased in May, and in May 19, he became the first rookie in Central League history to reach base in ten consecutive trips to the plate. On July 9, he went 5 for 4 against the Giants, and batted in 3 runs, including his first pro career homerun off Shun Yamaguchi in the 5th inning. His last RBI on that game was a two-base center field hit that won the game in the 9th inning.

Playing Style.
Kento is a 175 cm infielder who has experience fielding as 2nd baseman, shortstop and third baseman. His right arm boasts a 110-meter throwing distance, while his 50-meter dash was clocked at 6.1 seconds.

G. van Deynum

G. van Deynum ("fl" 1650-1659) was a <a href="still%20life">still life</a> <a href="painter">painter</a> active in Antwerp in the 1650s. Only a dozen works by his hand have been identified to date. Van Deynum painted banquet style still lifes and <a href="vanitas">vanitas</a> still lifes.
Life.
Nothing is known about the life of G. van Deynum. Only the first initial of his name is known. He is in some sources referred to as 'Guilliam van Deynum'. He is believed to have been a member of the family of artists active in Antwerp, which included the miniaturists <a href="Jan%20Baptist%20van%20Deynum">Jan Baptist</a> and Abraham van Deynum. His activity in Antwerp in the 1650s is known from one work dated 1654.
G. van Deynum is sometimes confused with the artist Gerard (Gerrit) van Deynen who worked in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> and was possibly the father or brother of the still life painter <a href="Isaac%20van%20Duynen">Isaac van Duynen</a>. He is sometimes also confused with the Flemish portrait painter <a href="Guilliam%20van%20Deynum">Guilliam van Deynum</a>.
Work.
Only about 10 to 15 works have been attributed to this artist. He mainly painted small still lifes of fruit and some <a href="pronkstilleven">pronkstilleven</a>s (sumptuous still lifes). A single <a href="vanitas">vanitas</a> still life has been attributed to him.

His work shows the influence of <a href="Jan%20Davidszoon%20de%20Heem">Jan Davidszoon de Heem</a>, a Dutch still life painter who was active in Antwerp from the mid-1630s. Some of van Duynum's still lifes copied elements of compositions by de Heem from the late 1640s and early 1650s. Some of the works of van Deynum have been attributed to van Heem and have been falsely signed as de Heem.

Some of his works have also been attributed to <a href="Gilliam%20Dandoy">Gilliam Dandoy</a>, another Flemish follower of de Heem working in Antwerp.

The artist was particularly skilled at rendering surface textures and light effects.

Häns'che Weiss

Häns'che Weiss (1951 – 2 June 2016) was a German <a href="gypsy%20jazz">gypsy jazz</a> and <a href="modern%20jazz">modern jazz</a> guitarist in the tradition of <a href="Django%20Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a>. From 1969-1972 he played with the <a href="Schnuckenack%20Reinhardt">Schnuckenack Reinhardt</a> Quintett, after which he made five albums with his own ensemble playing acoustic gypsy jazz along with self-composed and traditional gypsy tunes. From the early 80s to his death he played in a more mainstream/bebop jazz style with other German jazz artists including the violinist Martin Weiss (his nephew), and the double bass player Vali Mayer. 

Life and work.
Weiss was born in 1951 in Berlin to a musical <a href="Sinto">Sinto</a> (German gypsy) family, learning the guitar from his father Gono who before the second world war had played violin, guitar, accordion and zither. Taking up the guitar at age 13, two years later he won first prize in a young talent competition in Berlin. By the age of 18, he was already an excellent guitarist in the tradition of <a href="Django%20Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a> and in December 1969 was picked by <a href="Schnuckenack%20Reinhardt">Schnuckenack Reinhardt</a> to join his quintet in the role of solo guitarist. Over the succeeding two and a half years he played with this group in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France and played as solo guitarist on two of the quintet's albums ("Musik deutscher Zigeuner 3" and "Musik deutscher Zigeuner 4"), produced by Siegfried Maeker for the Da Camera Song label.

In September 1972 at age 21, Weiss left Schnuckenack's ensemble to found his own group, the Häns'che Weiss Quintet which drew some of its members from the (old) Schnuckenack Reinhardt Quintet. This new group comprised Häns'che Weiss on solo guitar, the then 15-year old prodigy <a href="Titi%20Winterstein">Titi Winterstein</a> on violin, Holzmanno Winterstein and Ziroli Winterstein on rhythm guitars and Hojok Merstein on double bass. This line-up travelled to the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in 1975 where they played at the prestigious <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> Folk Festival. In 1976 Holzmanno Winterstein departed and was replaced by the excellent guitarist <a href="Lulu%20Reinhardt">Lulu Reinhardt</a> who played both rhythm and additional lead guitar roles. The Quintet released five albums all produced by Siegfried Maeker: "Musik deutscher Zigeuner 5" (1973), for which the ensemble received the <a href="Deutscher%20Schallplattenpreis">Deutscher Schallplattenpreis</a> (German recorded music prize); "Musik deutscher Zigeuner 6", "Dja Maro Drom" (1974) on Electrola, "Das Häns'che Weiss Quintett" (1975) on Songbird, and "Fünf Jahre Musik deutscher Zigeuner" (1977) on Intercord. In addition to making powerful music, Weiss and his musicians also made an important commitment to the defense and understanding of the Sinti people and culture.

In the late 1970s the Quintet was dissolved and left to Titi Winterstein to continue. In 1981 Häns'che released the album "Couleurs", with a novel lineup including the percussionist Trilok Gurtu and second guitarist Romani Weiss. Subsequently, he formed a trio with his nephew, the young violinist Martin Weiss and bassist Vali Mayer. This line-up released the albums "Zugaben..." in 1985, "Erinnerungen" in 1988 and "Vis à vis" in 1991, with Weiss paying a more modern, <a href="bebop">bebop</a> style of jazz guitar inspired by his other idols such as <a href="Barney%20Kessel">Barney Kessel</a>, <a href="Wes%20Montgomery">Wes Montgomery</a>, <a href="Joe%20Pass">Joe Pass</a> and <a href="Kenny%20Burrell">Kenny Burrell</a>, also incorporating some influences from <a href="bossa%20nova">bossa nova</a>.

After the departure of Martin Weiss, who then began a solo career, Häns'che Weiss continued to perform as a duet with Vali Mayer, sometimes accompanied by the young pianist Micky Bamberger. This line-up released three albums in a more modern style: "Just play", "Just play II","The duo: live!", and performed regularly within Germany.

After being ill for some time, Häns'che Weiss died on 2 June 2016. His Django-inspired guitar work played a significant role in the revival of the "hot club" style of gypsy guitar playing from the late 1960s onwards and he is remembered not only for his fine playing and mentoring of younger musicians but also for his cheerful on-stage persona.

Gabriel Bataille

Gabriel Bataille (between June 1574 and June 1575 – 17 December 1630) was a French musician, lutenist and composer of <a href="air%20de%20cour">airs de cour</a>. He should not be confused with his son <a href="Gabriel%20II%20Bataille">Gabriel II Bataille</a>.

Biography.
The allusions to <a href="Brie%20%28region%29">Brie</a> in his verse pieces suggest that Gabriel Bataille was a native of this province. He had a brother Louis, a tailor, quoted in an act of 1621 and a sister Catherine, married to Didier Dutour, usher of the accounts and treasures in Paris, and died before 1600.

At the time of his marriage with Catherine Carre, on 12 February 1600, he was already a Parisian, but his marriage contract specified that he was then clerk to the parliamentary counselor Germain Regnault; Thus he was not yet a professional musician. When in 1608 <a href="Pierre%20I%20Ballard">Pierre I Ballard</a> published the first volumes of his "Airs de différents autheurs", he had probably become one: from 1614 he was listed as <a href="master%20of%20music">master of music</a>.

From 1617 to his death, he was master of music of the house of <a href="Anne%20of%20Austria">Anne of Austria</a> (1601–1666), by semester, alternating with <a href="Antoine%20Bo%C3%ABsset">Antoine Boësset</a>. He had signed a contract with the latter, which also aimed at this post, so that the one who would obtain it would share it with the other (what happened). He had to testify on 9 June 1617 at the trial of <a href="Leonora%20Dori">Leonora Galigai</a>, and described the exorbitant conditions imposed by the <a href="Concino%20Concini">Marshal d'Ancre</a> on the musicians who had applied for the charges of musician of the house of the queen (an entire year of wages).

Bataille inserted a piece of verse to the praise of Jacques Le Fèvre in his "Meslanges" dated 1613; By will, the latter left him on 22 December 1627, a part of the books of music which collected all his works. In 1617 and 1618, Bataille also published pieces of verses at the beginning of books by Antoine Boësset and <a href="Pierre%20Gu%C3%A9dron">Pierre Guédron</a>. It is thus necessary to see these three musicians at the center of his network of friends.

On 5 February 1614, he was a witness at the marriage of Jean Rocher, Sieur de Bréau, agent at the Finance Council. His friendship with Pierre I Ballard, which favored his career, shows in his sponsorship of Marguerite, daughter of the printer and Sansonne Coulon, dated 11 February 1619. On 22 January 1624, Gabriel Bataille was again witness of the marriage of <a href="Nicolas%20Chastelet">Nicolas Chastelet</a> (like him a musician of the queen) with Marie Sodey then on the 5 February of the same year, witness of the bride at the marriage of Thomas Vassetz, notary note-keeper at the <a href="Grand%20Ch%C3%A2telet">Grand Châtelet</a>, with Marie Carré, probably a sister of his wife.

He had four viable children: Pierre, ordinary musician of queens' music, Madeleine, <a href="Gabriel%20II%20Bataille">Gabriel II</a>, who succeeded him as master of the Queen's music (which suggests that he had obtained this charge in "survival" from his father), and Françoise.

His wife Catherine Carré was buried on 8 February 1624; Himself died on 17 December 1630 and was buried in the <a href="%C3%89glise%20Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis">église Saint-Paul</a> the day after. He then lived (at least since 1611). The inventory of his possessions, drawn up on 14 February 1631, revealed five lutes, 29 packages of music and an interesting library.

Works.
Court arias set to lute.
The most active period of the production of Bataille was between 1605 and 1620; After that date, and until his death, we have very little information about his life. In 1608 and 1615 he published a collection of court arias composed by the most prominent masters of the moment and arranged by him for voice and lute. It includes six books, some of which have been reissued, a sign of real success. Here is the list:

They contain mostly airs de cour, autonomous or excerpts of ballets represented at the time to the court of France. There are also nine psalms translated into verses measured by <a href="Philippe%20Desportes">Philippe Desportes</a>.

In these courtly tunes, Bataille took a lot of the works of <a href="Pierre%20Gu%C3%A9dron">Pierre Guédron</a>. He of course included in his collections several of his own compositions. He showed himself respectful of the original vocal melody, by decorating it appreciably. At the lute, he respected the original bass part, but more easily adapted the intermediate voices.

Many of the pieces in these collections have been included in collections of contemporary spiritual arias, such as "La Pieuse Alouette" of printer Jean Vervliet (Valenciennes, 1619–1621), which is a sign of a fairly wide spread.

Arias of his own.
Gabriel Bataille also composed his own tunes.
In these last collections, some tunes come from contemporary court ballets: "Ballet du roi" (c. 1616), "Ballet de La délivrance de Renaud" (1617), "Ballet de Monseigneur le Prince" (1620).

Dragan Jovanović (politician)

Dragan Jovanović () is a politician in <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. He has served in the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Serbia">National Assembly of Serbia</a> since 2014. Formerly a member of <a href="New%20Serbia">New Serbia</a>, he has been an independent deputy since January 2017.

Early life and career.
Jovanović was born in <a href="Aran%C4%91elovac">Aranđelovac</a>, then part of the <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Serbia">Socialist Republic of Serbia</a> in the <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>. He is a graduate of the <a href="University%20of%20Belgrade%20Faculty%20of%20Electrical%20Engineering">University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering</a>'s department of industrial management.

Political career.
Jovanović was New Serbia's secretary-general from 2003 until 2005, when he was elected to the first of two terms as a party vice-president. He became <a href="mayor">mayor</a> of <a href="Topola">Topola</a> via a direct election in 2004 and was returned to the position following the local elections of <a href="Serbian%20local%20elections%2C%202008">2008</a> and <a href="Serbian%20local%20elections%2C%202012">2012</a>.

In December 2007, Jovanović played a prominent role with other members of New Serbia and members of the <a href="Serbian%20Radical%20Party">Serbian Radical Party</a> in preventing the <a href="B92">B92</a> program "Peščanik" from recording an episode at Aranđelovac's House of Culture; the group took control of the microphones at the event and prevented it from starting. This action received considerable attention, including a reference in the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a>'s "Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2007", which indicates that Jovanović made further threats against B92 in a subsequent interview. Following the action, New Serbia members accused B92 of pursuing an "anti-Serb and anti-Constitutional campaign." B92 responded by suggesting that the campaign was actually motivated by its frequent criticisms of New Serbia leader <a href="Velimir%20Ili%C4%87">Velimir Ilić</a>. 

In 2009, Jovanović joined other Serbian politicians from across the political spectrum in accusing <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>n authorities of preventing <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a> from returning to the country and from participating in local elections.

Member of Parliament.
New Serbia.
From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties rather than to individual candidates, and the parties were responsible for choosing candidates from their lists to become deputies. Jovanović was included in New Serbia's <a href="electoral%20list">electoral list</a>s in the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202003">2003</a> and <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202007">2007</a> parliamentary elections, although he was not included as part of its parliamentary delegation on either occasion. He briefly received a mandate following the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202008">2008</a> election, in which New Serbia ran on a combined list with the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20of%20Serbia">Democratic Party of Serbia</a>, but he resigned after only a month to permit party leader Velimir Ilić to enter the assembly as a replacement.

Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. New Serbia joined the <a href="Serbian%20Progressive%20Party">Serbian Progressive Party</a>'s coalition electoral list for the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202012">2012 parliamentary election</a> and maintained its alliance with the Progressives for the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202014">2014</a> and <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202016">2016</a> elections. Jovanović was not a candidate in 2012 but received the ninety-eighth position on the Progressive-led list in 2014. The list won a landslide victory with 158 out of 250 mandates; Jovanović was declared elected and served his first full term. He received the 107th position in the 2016 and was returned for another term when the list won 131 mandates.
Independent.
Velimir Ilić expelled Jovanović from New Serbia in January 2017. This occurred after Ilić said he would withdraw support from the administration of Progressive Party leader <a href="Aleksandar%20Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87">Aleksandar Vučić</a>; Jovanović, as a party vice-president, responded that Ilić was entitled to his personal opinions but that the party as a whole remained supportive of the administration. Ilić justified his decision to expel Jovanović on the grounds that the latter had disobeyed the decisions of the party leadership, had made false claims about a diploma, and was compromised because of his involvement in a 2012 car accident. Jovanović rejected these claims and said that Ilić was actually concerned that he could pose a successful challenge for the leadership of the party.

At around the same time that Jovanović was expelled from New Serbia, deputies <a href="Dubravka%20Filipovski">Dubravka Filipovski</a> and <a href="Mladen%20Gruji%C4%87">Mladen Grujić</a> voluntarily left the party in opposition to Ilić's leadership and his decision to leave Vučić's coalition. All three now serve as independent members of the assembly, and all three continue to support the Progressive-led administration.

Jovanović is currently a member of the parliamentary committee on spatial planning, transport, infrastructure, and telecommunications; a deputy member of two other committees; and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, the <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.

NBC College Football Game of the Week

The NBC College Football Game of the Week refers to nationally televised broadcasts of Saturday afternoon <a href="college%20football">college football</a> games that were produced by <a href="NBC%20Sports">NBC Sports</a>, the sports division of the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> television network in the United States. It should be noted that <a href="Bowl%20game">Bowl game</a>s were always exempt from the NCAA's television regulations, and the games' organizers were free to sign rights deals with any network. In NBC's case, the <a href="1952%20Rose%20Bowl">1952 Rose Bowl</a> at the end of that particular season was the first national <a href="List%20of%20Rose%20Bowl%20broadcasters">telecast</a> of a college bowl game.

Background.
NBC first televised college football on September 30, <a href="1939%20college%20football%20season">1939</a>. NBC broadcast the game between <a href="1939%20Waynesburg%20vs.%20Fordham%20football%20game">Waynesburg and Fordham</a> on station <a href="WNBC%23Experimental%20operations">W2XBS</a> (which would eventually become NBC's <a href="Flagship%20%28broadcasting%29">flagship</a> station, WNBC) with one camera and <a href="Bill%20Stern">Bill Stern</a> was the sole announcer. Estimates are that the broadcast reached approximately 1,000 television sets. Twelve years later, the first live regular season college football game to be broadcast coast-to-coast aired on NBC.. The game in question, was <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football">Duke</a> at the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football">University of Pittsburgh</a> on September 29, 1951.

Pretty soon on June 6, <a href="1952%20college%20football%20season">1952</a>, NBC Head of Sport Tom Gallery led negotiations towards a one-year football contract (for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>1,144,000) with the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a>. The contract incidentally came about after the 1951 NCAA convention voted 161-7 to outlaw televised games except for those licensed by the NCAA staff. The deal allowed NBC to select one game a week to broadcast on Saturday afternoons, with the assurance that no other NCAA college football broadcast would appear on a competitive network. In the first college football game to be broadcast under this new NCAA television contract, on September 20, <a href="Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football">Kansas</a> defeated <a href="1952%20TCU%20Horned%20Frogs%20football%20team">TCU</a> 13-0.

By <a href="1953%20college%20football%20season">1953</a>, the NCAA allowed NBC to add what it called "panorama" coverage of multiple regional broadcasts for certain weeks – shifting national viewers to the most interesting game during its telecast.

Private career.
Jovanović was director of the Serbian Social Accountancy Service in the <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> at the time of that country's disintegration. In an interview with <a href="Tanjug">Tanjug</a> in July 1991, he remarked that the constituent republics of Yugoslavia, and in particular <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> and <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, had stopped making mutual payments due to the deteriorating political situation. This, he added, was preventing Serbia from making its payments to those republics.

Marepe (artist)

Marepe (born Marcos Reis Peixoto; 1970) is a Brazilian contemporary artist best known for his minimalist wood and metal sculptures and drawings. His artwork alludes his origins: culture and tradition of his birthplace, the concept of shortage, colonization and globalization are the artist's main approaches. Marepe lives and works in <a href="Santo%20Antonio%20de%20Jesus">Santo Antonio de Jesus</a>, Brazil.

Education.
In 1989, when Marepe had his first notable success by winning the first prize at the Recôncavo Biennale (Brazil) he refused an offer to study at the <a href="University%20of%20Fine%20Arts%20of%20Hamburg">University of Fine Arts of Hamburg</a> continuing his visual arts studies at the <a href="Federal%20University%20of%20Bahia">Federal University of Bahia</a>.

Work.
Marepe's artwork expresses his personal perception upon his life juxtaposed with the political and socio-cultural spirit of Brazil, represented using everyday objects, local materials and events from his home based surroundings.

In 2013, during an exposition at the <a href="Inhotim">Inhotim Institute</a> (Brazil) where Marepe exposed a metal sculpture, "A Cabra / The Goat", his curator claimed to The New York Times that "Marepe is connected to the popular culture of Brazil, and how people represent the more rustic elements of their lives".

In "Veja Meu Bem" (2007), made to last just two days at <a href="Tate%20Modern">Tate Modern</a>'s Turbine Hall, Marepe reconstructed the atmosphere of a Brazilian funfair, installing a festival carousel and adding to it a chute of sugar-coated fruits, accessible to the viewers. The artwork was inspired by what he called "beautiful and precarious Brazil" and it was a way to bring a piece of his native country to London — a shift comparable to a prior installation art project, where the artist took a painted exterior wall from <a href="Santo%20Antonio%20de%20Jesus">Santo Antonio de Jesus</a> to the <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20Art%20Biennial">São Paulo Art Biennial</a>.

Transporting ordinary objects into the world of art, the artist honours the Duchampian wave of the prêt-à-porter, but he also induces it, creating new meanings. The fact that Marepe lives in his native town influences his art; the everyday life in Brazil is Marape's source for creation: stalls, low-income ménages, metallic basins or trees trunk - are mixed in his artwork. Marepe includes these items in different universes resulting an "alterity" within the artistic world, alluding subjects as colonialism, identity issues, various differences between social classes and the antithesis between the modern and the traditional lifestyles.

Marepe renders objects which may seem useless but which are a necessity in some of the under developed areas of Brazil. In contrast with this, he calls his works "necessities". One of Marepe's artworks, "Peixe Com Auréola" (2012), consisted in a bicycle designed in such way it couldn't be ridden, having a wheel emerging from the seat. He also replaced the two classical wheels with a fish head in the front and a fish tail, both made of wood, in the back. Through this artwork, according to the former American news website, <a href="Examiner.com">Examiner.com</a>, Marepe tried to express "the dire need in his community for the type of abundance necessary to pursue greater meaning in life".

Herbert Hawkins (cricketer)

Herbert Hervey Baines Hawkins (9 January 1876 – 1 January 1933) was an <a href="England">English</a> <a href="cricketer">cricketer</a> who played in 20 <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> matches for <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a> between 1896 and 1899. He was born at <a href="Streatham%20Hill">Streatham Hill</a> in <a href="London">London</a> and died at <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a> in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.

Hawkins was educated at <a href="Whitgift%20School">Whitgift School</a>, then called Whitgift Grammar, and at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>. As a first-class cricketer, he was primarily a bowler: a tall right-arm medium pace bowler and a right-handed lower-order batsman. In his first two years at Cambridge, he suffered from the bowling and batting riches available to the university cricket team: in his single match in 1896, he bowled just two expensive overs, and in 1897, given two games, he bowled in only one of the four innings played by Cambridge's opponents. Better opportunities came in 1898, when Hawkins impressed in the senior trial match by taking 11 wickets in a 12-a-side game. In another 12-a-side match, this time a first-class game between Cambridge University and the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC), he was instrumental in securing a narrow Cambridge victory by taking seven wickets for 45 runs, and he followed that up with five for 37 against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> in the very next match. That led to his selection for the 1898 <a href="University%20Match%20%28cricket%29">University Match</a> against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>, though he had no success in the game. In 1899, he was again a regular member of the Cambridge first team, and though his bowling figures for the season were less successful than in 1898, he had a better game in the University Match, taking four wickets, albeit expensively. That match was his final appearance in first-class cricket. 

Hawkins graduated from <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in 1898 and this was upgraded to a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a> in 1903. He became a schoolmaster in France, and an obituary in 1933 states that he attempted to introduce something of the ethos of the English public school into France, though the work was stopped by the outbreak of the First World War. He served in the <a href="Royal%20Garrison%20Artillery">Royal Garrison Artillery</a> in the war, reaching the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a>. After the war, he became the headmaster of a preparatory school for the children of colonial administrators at <a href="Nuwara%20Eliya">Nuwara Eliya</a> in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>; he was still in post when he and his wife were drowned while bathing on New Year's Day, 1933, at Trincomalee.

DZ-manga

DZ-manga (, <a href="ALA-LC">ALA-LC</a>: "dīzād māngah"), sometimes written DZ manga, are <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a>s originally published in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, either in <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> or <a href="Berber%20languages">Tamazight</a>, that draw inspiration from Japanese <a href="manga">manga</a>.

Etymology.
Other name variations on DZ-manga, such as Algerian manga and manga-influenced comics can occasionally be heard as substitute names, but the term "DZ-manga" is the most commonly used.

The term "international manga", as used by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Japan%29">Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, encompasses all foreign comics which draw inspiration from the "form of presentation and expression" found in Japanese <a href="manga">manga</a>.

History.
Although <a href="manga">manga</a> was only recently introduced to <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, its current 
popularity can be traced to the appearance on Algerian airwaves of its televised sister, the <a href="anime">anime</a>. In the 1980s, Algeria's lone state-controlled national television network (then RTA, later renamed ENTV and then <a href="EPTV%20%28TV%20network%29">EPTV</a>) broadcast youth programs that featured Japanese animated TV series dubbed in <a href="French-language">French</a> or <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>. These programs were largely an oddity: at a time when <a href="mass%20media">mass media</a> explicitly aimed to differentiate Algerian national identity from Western influences, the RTA was pressured by the Ministry of Information and Culture to favor local productions and shows from the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab world</a>. The RTA, however, was often unable to answer this growing demand. Following the example of nearby Arab countries, it chose Japanese animation as an economical and culturally accessible alternative to <a href="Modern%20animation%20in%20the%20United%20States">American animation</a>. As a result, anime such as "<a href="Grendizer">Grendizer</a>" or "<a href="Captain%20Tsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a>" made an indelible mark on youth growing up in the 1980s, leading Yacine Haddad (2008) – a rising star in the Algerian manga community – to dub this generation "the "Otaku" Generation" ("<a href="otaku">otaku</a>", a <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese language</a> word for a particular type of nerdy manga fan, has been reappropriated by communities outside of <a href="Japan">Japan</a> to generically suggest a manga and anime enthusiast).

The prevalence of anime in Algeria increased rapidly starting in the late 1980s, facilitated by both technological and political factors: the rapid spread of <a href="Television%20in%20Algeria">cable and satellite access</a> at that time coincided with a short-lived political <a href="liberalization">liberalization</a> (1989–1992) and the corresponding decrease in state control over programming. Algerian viewers responded readily, rapidly developing an enthusiastic following for French translations of anime from across the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>. By the turn of the millennium, satellite television further expanded the market, bringing anime dubbed in Arabic to <a href="Arabophone">Arabophone</a> viewers, on networks such as <a href="Spacetoon">Spacetoon</a> and the <a href="Middle%20East%20Broadcasting%20Center">Middle East Broadcasting Center</a> (MBC), as well as the <a href="%C3%89tablissement%20de%20la%20radiodiffusion-t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision%20tunisienne">Tunisian Radio and Television Establishment</a> (ERTT). The emergence of broad Algerian interest in manga coincided with this growth in demand for anime. Furthermore, like anime, Algerian manga's growing <a href="Anime%20and%20manga%20fandom">fanbase</a> included a heterogeneous selection of linguistic communities: unlike much print media and <a href="literature">literature</a>, the new works were equally able to attract Arabophone and 
<a href="Francophonie">Francophone</a> readers. More recently, the rise of the Internet age further enhanced the spread of manga in Algeria: <a href="Video%20hosting%20service">video-sharing technologies</a> have made a wide selection of anime available at little or no cost, and Algerian otakus' <a href="blog">blog</a>s have brought together the community of manga enthusiasts, encouraging the development and exchange of <a href="Fan%20labor">fanmade productions</a> and <a href="scanlation">scanlation</a>s (amateur captionings of foreign comics).

By the end of the 2000s, <a href="List%20of%20manga%20publishers">publishers</a> finally found it feasible to start commercially supporting manga production: Kaza and Lazhari Labter, both publishers of youth literature, began publishing manga in 2011, and Z-Link, the first publisher dedicated entirely to manga was founded in 2007. Among these, the most notable is Z-Link: with a specific focus on developing new artists and bringing them to the market, it predominantly publishes small-format, softcover, black and white manga books with a small DZ-manga icon in the bottom left corner of their jackets. These run either as independent volumes or, on rare occasions, as installments in a small series (like "Victory Road"). They are printed on low-quality paper, allowing locally published volumes to remain affordable. This combination of publication strategies has enabled Algerian manga to circumvent the financial barrier to access that young Algerian consumers face with imported manga and even local BD albums. Easy to serialize, Z-Link's low-cost medium has also helped artists to compete – at least on a local level – with foreign manga that admittedly are more intricate and include higher quality graphics.

Z-Link and Kaza both pride themselves on <a href="horizontal%20integration">horizontal integration</a> of their in-house management, where the <a href="artist">artist</a>s are given full control over all steps of the <a href="publication">publication</a> of their product – from creation, to <a href="editing">editing</a>, <a href="publishing">publishing</a> and <a href="Distribution%20%28business%29">distribution</a>. Z-Link goes even further, working to foster new talent until it can gain a truly public following: traditional calls for submission are supplemented by scouting of unpublished works on blogs, <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> pages and other collective platforms used by fan communities online. Aspiring artists are encouraged to reach out to an <a href="audience">audience</a>, so that budding <a href="amateur">amateur</a>s, who previously created for friends, can develop a wider fanbase and become published artists. Typically, new artists first publish short installments in Z-Link's monthly manga and gaming magazine, "Laabstore", before being commissioned to produce a small print run (500–1,000 copies) of an independent volume. This structure permits Z-Link to reconfigure the traditional publishing channels and capitalize on its position between conventional publication and self-production. It provides the infrastructure for autonomous artists to achieve local print runs at a reasonable cost. Since their creation, Z-Link and Kaza have developed an enthusiastic and loyal following. Their catalogs, however, remain limited in number and difficult to procure, as the works are still distributed through a capillary network including a few bookstores in <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, <a href="Oran">Oran</a> and <a href="Constantine">Constantine</a>.

Characteristics.
DZ-manga has come to encompass a variety of <a href="Work%20of%20art">artworks</a> that differ widely in how they relate to their <a href="Japan">Japanese</a> predecessors. These disparate works are united by their use of references to and techniques from <a href="Manga">Japanese manga</a>: they frequently use drawing styles derived from it, often incorporate the <a href="Aesthetics">stylized aesthetics</a> and facial portrayals that popularly characterize the medium, and occasionally even refer directly to <a href="Character%20%28arts%29">characters</a> or <a href="Dramatic%20structure">plotlines</a> from <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20manga">famous works</a>. Within this loose commonality, however, lies a broad spectrum of stylistic variations. Books produced by Algerian <a href="List%20of%20manga%20publishers">manga publisher</a> Z-Link are carefully modeled after the Japanese format, in stark contrast to those produced by young-adult literature publisher Kaza, which are colorized and read <a href="Left-to-right%20mark">left-to-right</a>.

Formatting differences in Algerian manga productions derive in part from assumptions held by publishers about the expectations of their readership. The colorized, left-to-right formatting of Kaza emphasizes the historical connection between Algerian artists and <a href="Franco-Belgian%20comics">Franco-Belgian graphic traditions</a>, easing the reader from a familiar style into narrative plots and <a href="Manga%20iconography">iconography</a> inspired by Japanese <a href="sh%C5%8Dnen%20manga">shōnen manga</a> which might otherwise seem alienating. In contrast, Z-Link's publications follow the emerging interest of Algerian readers in cultural models outside of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. Works in this spirit strictly follow the aesthetic formalisms of Japanese manga, including <a href="right-to-left">right-to-left</a> pagination, stereotyped facial features such as oversized doe-eyes, caricatured facial emotions, and expressive dialogue bubbles.

Cultural status.
In addition to the many conventional difficulties that DZ-manga has 
overcome in order to be successfully marketed in Algeria – such as the medium <a href="literacy">literacy</a> rate and the limited <a href="purchasing%20power">purchasing power</a> – Algerian <a href="Mangaka">manga authors</a> have also been impeded by a lack of broadly recognized cultural status. Contrary to <a href="editorial%20cartoon">editorial cartoon</a>s and s, which have successfully established a tradition with their commentary on current events, manga has not yet established an identity internally within the <a href="Culture%20of%20Algeria">Algerian cultural landscape</a>. This lack of tradition is compounded by the nature of manga itself: its relative newness, its constitutive topical heterogeneity, and its complete independence from <a href="History%20of%20Algeria%20%281962%E2%80%9399%29">French-Algerian postcolonial rhetoric</a> make manga a free agent, without a well-defined market or tradition. Recognizing this, producers of manga have attempted to graft their art onto other causes and traditions in order to expend DZ-manga's appeal and insinuate it into broader Algerian culture.

Kaza director and <a href="Graphic%20designer">graphic artist</a> Selim Zerdani, for example, integrated manga into his efforts to develop elementary literacy. He justifies his choice to publish a manga in <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a> (MSA) with his personal imperative to guide readers toward better reading: "Many people do not know how to speak this language [classical Arabic] properly, thus it is only legitimate to direct readers toward a good reading". Zerdani's valuative judgment echoes biases against <a href="Algerian%20Arabic">dialectal Arabic</a> as an improper language which were cultivated by the last forty years of the Algerian government's linguistic policy. Implicitly, however, his judgment also promotes manga as a respectable form of <a href="literature">literature</a>, inviting educators and parents alike to consider it an informal educational tool. Zerdani's work effectively legitimized Algerian discourse about manga, helping to broaden its market and to provide a new voice for Zerdani's ideas about Arabic literacy.

Other manga works in Algeria employ a similar strategy: authors attempt to expand the resonance of their works by appealing to established tropes within Algerian culture. Fella Matougui's and Salim Brahimi's <a href="sh%C5%8Djo%20manga">shōjo manga</a> "Nahla et les Touareg" (2010), for example, uses the openness of the manga format to present <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg</a> culture. Published for the Ahaggar Arts International Festival, celebrating the cultural heritage of <a href="Hoggar%20Mountains">this Saharan region</a>, "Nahla et les Touareg" provides an extremely effective – didactic yet fashionable — mode of transmission of Targui culture to urbanized Algerian youth.

DZ-manga's utility as a voice for local concerns arises from its flexibility as a medium. Local concerns are fused with global aesthetics, irrespective of the boundaries that demarcate other literatures. <a href="Public%20opinion">Street politics</a> mix casually with <a href="Religion">religious topics</a>. Specific traits borrowed from Japanese manga pair with styles and themes characteristic of comics and Franco-Belgian style '. The same circumstances that gave rise to this fluidity have permitted a renewed exploration of creative forms in Algerian manga: as this new medium grows, new creative politics are being explored as well. One notable example is Selim Zerdani's '/" (2009), a collaborative effort between Zerdani and 12 other graphic artists, published by his own publishing house, Kaza.

Collaborative works illustrate the way in which manga and its European and American counterparts are seen by Algerian graphic artists: not as mutually exclusive, but rather as complementary media that can bring together diverse readerships. The foreign analogues to the different strains of Algerian graphic art – ', comics and manga – are often defined by their differences with each other; collectively produced manga such as '/", instead, bring diverse sources together with new modes of affiliation based on non-hierarchical relations. In such works, artists draw their stylistic choices from an array of ideas which are neither localized nor confined, creating a composite structure which forces readers to move consciously in a world marked by a transnational fluidity of images and references.

History.
The first mention of the Church of Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow in Bessergenevskaya village dates back to 1647. In 1797, due to dilapidation of the old church, a new, wooden one with a bell tower was built. The latter was consecrated in 1800 also in the name of Metropolitan Alexius. In 1810 the stanitsa moved to a new place. The temple was also transferred. In 1858, it was moved again, this time to Kazachy-Kadamovsky <a href="khutor">khutor</a>.

In 1882, instead of the wooden church, a stone church was erected. The old church was later moved to Yagodinka village. This new stone church has had two chapels: the first one was consecrated in the name of the <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20Kazan">Kazan Icon of the Mother of God</a> and the second one - in the name of <a href="Three%20Saints">Three Saints</a>.

In 1920s, the church was closed and a forage warehouse was establsihed inside. In 1957, a <a href="bolt%20of%20lightning">bolt of lightning</a> struck inside the <a href="bell-tower">bell-tower</a> and damaged its walls.

<doc id="54863578" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54863578" title="Applied Improvisation">
Applied Improvisation

This term is used as a term to describe applying improvisational methods in various fields like consulting and corporate training, facilitating (workshops, team trainings, meetings, conferences…), teaching, coaching, researching, generating or evolving ideas and designs, theatrical training and playing, medical and therapeutic settings or in social work.

History.
<a href="Shamanism">Shamans</a> are part of every culture, starting from the origin of humanity in the Stone Age. They used stories, initiated and facilitated various rituals consisting of <a href="storytelling">storytelling</a>, dances and embodiment of past or future events and challenges. They applied basic principles of improvisation, to help people, to collaborate, to understand what is happening around them and to cope with daily life.

The Sanskrit-Theater originated 1.000 BC is a very early form of theatre. The vidusaka was part of the cast and the plot and at the same time stepped out, made comments, that mostly were improvised. He can also be seen as the first appearance of a <a href="clown">clown</a>.

Starting about 600 BC <a href="Rhapsode">Rhapode</a>s travelled around Greece. He – only men – combined in an improvised way the epics of e. g. of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, myths, tales, jokes, songs and adapted this mixture spontaneously to local expectations and situations. In many aspects he built upon the traditions of the shamans and the <a href="trickster">trickster</a>. 

In the fifth century BC originated in Greece an intense examination of improvisation applied in <a href="Rhetoric%23History">rhetoric</a>. Schools were established, to learn how to improvise a speech which had a t relevance as instrument of <a href="democracy">democracy</a> and <a href="Civics">civic education</a>. 

The fourth century BC in Greece is an important milestone for the history of theatre: The roots of drama and comedy were established, also in the <a href="Phlyax%20play">phylax play</a>, a <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> dramatic, played on wooden stages: A lot of the content was improvised. Improvisation also was applied in the <a href="Atellan%20Farce">Atellan Farces</a> in ancient Rome. 

Always a combination of stocked and improvised moves, dances and artistic movements coined performances of <a href="Pantomime">Pantomime</a>s – in ancient Rome it was also one of the origins of improvised dancing. Their performances were influenced through traditions of the Etruscans. They also performend on public spaces, traveling around the country. 

From the 12 to the 14 century <a href="Minnesang">Minnesang</a> was very popular. The musicians visited castles and cities, they used stocked textes and music and added a lot of improvisation, inspired also by historical events, social developments and reactions of the audience. Both, Commedia dell’Arte and Minnesang can also be perceived as a contribution to adult education and <a href="Civics">civic education</a> in a time, literacy was not common and access to information often difficult. 

Also in the 12th emerged the <a href="Jester">Jester</a> and had the task to use improvisational methods to call attention to urgent matters of politics and society. He was allowed to critise decisions of the emperors. In many ways he incoporactes the practise of the Trickster. 

In medieval Italy <a href="Commedia%20dell%27arte">Commedia dell’Arte</a> was a revival of the Atellan Farces: Groups of actors travelled also through parts of Europe. As inspiration for the improvised parts of their plays they also used political events and current social issues, what they experienced and heard in other cities, as well as wishes and reactions of the audience. 

In the 17 century the <a href="Pedagogy">pedagogue</a> <a href="John%20Amos%20Comenius">John Comenius</a> was one of the first who emphasized the significance of play and games as method for learning and teaching – he referred to the works of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>. Games often consist of stepping into different personas in a blink of a moment, of pretending being in various settings and genres. They often have a certain structure and also invite to play with this structures, evolve them – therefore improvisation is an important aspect of games. Also games are often the starting points for improvisation and theatrical approaches. Also pedagogues like <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Pestalozzi">Pestalozzi</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Fr%C3%B6bel">Fröbel</a> and <a href="Montessori%20education">Montessori</a> applied games and role plays in education.

The social worker <a href="Neva%20Boyd">Neva Boyd</a> collected around 1920 description of various games and added own inventions. She used them to teach language skills, problem-solving, self-confidence and social skills in Chicago. She also accompanied people to cope with the effects of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. Boyd also worked together with the theatre academic and educator <a href="Viola%20Spolin">Viola Spolin</a>. She used and evolved her games which   „…were meant to promote creative expression through self discovery and personal experiences between children with extremely diverse backgrounds.” (LaPolice, 2012, S. 26). Spolin also emphasized, that these games and exercises evolved key competencies like <a href="self-efficacy">self-efficacy</a>, creativity, the ability for <a href="collaboration">collaboration</a> and to tackle problems. Spolin applied the games and exercises also in workshops for actors of the <a href="Compass%20Players">Compass Theater</a> in Chicago, the first improvisational theatre group. 

Also in the 1920ies <a href="Jacob%20L.%20Moreno">Jakob L. Moreno</a> summarized existing ideas and founded in Vienna the Stegreiftheater, the Theater of Spontaneity: People attending were actors as well as the audience – the shift took often place within a used improvisational exercises or scene. Later on he used these experiences in the development of psychodrama – improvisational approaches are an important aspect in this method. 

Starting in the 1950ies the educator and playwright <a href="Keith%20Johnstone">Keith Johnstone</a> developed in the USA and Canada various improvisational games – they not only were used to train actors or to prepare for performances of improvisational theatre groups but also in workshops and projects with teachers of shools and universities, trainers in juvenile and adult education. In the development of improvisational theater also <a href="Del%20Close">Del Close</a> had an important function, as he developed also long form games.

Also in the 1950ies started the work of <a href="Augusto%20Boal">Augusto Boal</a>: He also developed various improvisational methods and applied them e. g. in the <a href="Theatre%20of%20the%20Oppressed">theatre of the oppressed</a>. Actors and audience switch their roles often; Boals methods are also applied in civic education, in the training of teachers of all fields and in politics. 

1975 Johnathan Fox and Jo Salas founded the first <a href="Playback%20Theatre">Playback Theatre</a>: People from an audience tell stories of their lives, which are after that transformed in theatrical sequenzes by actors, using improvisational methods speaking, singing and dancing.  

In the late 1990s the <a href="performative%20turn">performative turn</a> began in social research. Performance – also any kind of using improvisational approaches - was not longer considered only as a process on a theatre stage with a rather passive audience, but as a comprehensive principle for researching and understanding human actions. People like Shaun McNiff started to apply improvisational methods in arts based research projects. 

2002 the Applied Improvisation Network was founded, a non-profit organization of people using improvisational methods in various fields. 

Examples for the implementation of Applied Improvisation.
Additional in the training of actors and as preparation to improvisational theater, applied improvisation e. g. is used:

In consulting and corporate trainings Applied Improvisation is used e. g. in team and sales training, workshops for presentation skills, resilience, leadership and for people responsible for innovations. 

Applied Improvisation is also often used in methods like Design Thinking and in Service Design projects – therefore the methods are also researched and applied in UX-Design. And it is used in evolving engineering.

Another field for Applied Improvisation is in the education and advanced training for people working in the fields of social work, medical and health care and medicine. ( a list of literature can be found here http://www.medicalimprov.org/read-more/) A new approach is to apply improv for disaster rediness and response. Additional to Psychodrama improvisational methods are also used in other therapeutic settings and drama therapy. 

In Education improvisational approaches are used in all fields of teaching teachers, of designing and evolving didactical concepts, and also as a method of student centered learning. 

As mentioned in the history, improvisational methods are also applied as research tools since the permormative turn. There are several projects connected to Applied Drama where improvisation is an important aspect. There are also examples of use in the fields of health and life sciences, in evolving didactics and in design research.

The Applied Improvisation Network.
The <a href="http%3A//appliedimprovisation.network/">Applied Improvisation Network</a> (AIN) is a global community of over 5000 members online and numerous local groups. Practitioners of applied improvisation facilitate workshops, for individuals or organisations, introducing them to these principles, tools etc. via solo, paired or group exercises, activities and games.

The members of the AIN are business professionals and academics who use improvisation tools, experience, and theory for human development and training in communities and organizations. The network includes consultants, managers, trainers, coaches, facilitators, performers and academics.
The AIN was founded in 2002 by Paul Z Jackson, Michael Rosenburg and Alain Rostain. Since then the number of local groups and online communities has grown year by year, with a series of conferences, regional events and roadshows in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia.

John B. Murray (general)

John B. Murray (August 13, 1822 – October 8, 1884) Bvt. Brig. General, attorney

John Boyce Murray is known as one of the founders of <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a>, along with druggist <a href="Henry%20C.%20Welles">Henry C. Welles</a>. Murray was born in <a href="Arlington%2C%20Vermont">Arlington, Vermont</a> to Edward and Phoebe Manchester Murray. He married Angelina Savage in 1848 and they had two children, William and Maud while living in Bearytown (now Fayette), New York. He moved to Seneca Falls, NY in 1853 where he joined the state militia and began practicing law. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he was commissioned a Captain of the 50th New York State Engineers. He resigned his commission in the summer of 1862 but rejoined the 148th Regiment, New York Volunteers as a Major that fall. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1863 and to Colonel in 1864. He was brevetted to the rank of Brigadier General for meritorious service in 1865. He moved to <a href="Waterloo%2C%20New%20York%20%28village%29">Waterloo, New York</a> after being elected Seneca County Clerk in the fall of 1865. It was here that he met Welles. Murray became active in the Grand Army of the Republic and was appointed postmaster. He resumed his law practice in 1880 and spoke at political rallies and Memorial Day services. It was following one of his speeches on October 7, 1884 that he became ill and succumbed the next day. 

Presidential Proclamation.
President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> proclaimed Waterloo the birthplace of the holiday following the passage of House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 587 in 1966. The resolution and proclamation were based on research done by eight members of the community who comprised the Research Committee of the Waterloo Memorial Day Centennial Committee. Their purpose was to promote the centennial of the founding of Memorial Day on May 5, 1866. The holiday was supposedly conceived by Welles who communicated the idea to Murray, the county clerk who helped carry it out.

Myth Exposed.
Almost fifty years after the proclamation, Bellware and Gardiner published "The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America" and call into question the veracity of that claim. According to the research committee, there are no contemporaneous reports of this celebration. Their earliest sources date from 1882, sixteen years after the event. Bellware and Gardiner, however, uncovered evidence that this story was a myth. This evidence includes an earlier report from 1875 in a New York newspaper that describes, in detail, Waterloo’s first Memorial Day and places it in 1868 as well as other inconsistencies between the historical record and the story compiled by the Centennial Committee. They also note a complete lack of discussion or debate by the congressional committee behind HCR 587. Unlike Welles, Murray seems complicit in the hoax. He was called the founder of Memorial Day during his lifetime and was in demand as a Memorial Day orator.

The headquarters and the headquarters battery were inducted into Federal service at home stations on 6 January 1941. On 19 January it was moved to <a href="Camp%20Haan">Camp Haan</a>, California, where it conducted training. 

With the regiment, the 1st Battalion's headquarters and headquarters battery staged through <a href="Camp%20Murray">Camp Murray</a>, Washington, from 7 August, and departed the <a href="Seattle">Seattle Port of Embarkation</a> on 29 August.

Salva Sanchis

Salva (Salvador) Sanchis is a Spanish dancer, choreographer and dance teacher.

Training.
Salva Sanchis was born in <a href="Manresa">Manresa</a>, a city near <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. He followed a theater training at Barcelona's <a href="Institut%20del%20Teatre">Institut del Teatre</a>, where he specialized in <a href="physical%20theatre">physical theatre</a>, mime techniques, <a href="Swordsmanship">sword fighting</a>, <a href="acrobatics">acrobatics</a> and <a href="Aikido">Aikido</a>. In 1995, he moved to Belgium to study in Brussels at <a href="P.A.R.T.S.">P.A.R.T.S.</a>, the dance school founded by <a href="Anne%20Teresa%20De%20Keersmaeker">Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker</a>. There he created various dance solo and group choreographies. His graduation project "Less than a moment", a one-hour choreography for five dancers, was performed at different places in Europe. Salva Sanchis graduated from P.A.R.T.S in 1998 with the first generation of students. On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the dance school, he co-ordinated with the dancer / choreographer <a href="Heine%20R%C3%B8sdal%20Avdal">Heine Avdal</a> the program "P.A.R.T.S. Generation 1 (1995-1998)" that was presented at the Brussels Beursschouwburg in November 2015.

Initial period.
From 1998, his work evolved from a theater-influenced style to a pronounced abstract approach to dance. In particular, his choreography "Previous" (2003), again a piece for five dancers, marked that change of direction to a more abstract language and an in-depth study of improvisation. In addition to his choreographies, Salva collaborated in the period 2000-2004 regularly with choreographer Marc Vanrunxt (on his productions "Performance" and "Most Recent"), video artist Elke Vandermeerschen and visual artist Kristof Van Gestel. With Marc Vanrunxt he also collaborated afterwards.

Collaboration with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas.
From 2002 to 2007, Salva Sanchis was associated with Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker’s dance company Rosas. He started as a dancer in "Bitches Brew / Tacoma Narrows" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 2003). For "Cassandra - speaking in twelve voices" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 2004), he collaborated on the dance vocabulary, but did not participate as a dancer in production. For the two productions that followed, "Raga for the Rainy Season / A Love Supreme" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 2005) and "Desh" (Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 2005) he was, together with Anne Teressa De Keersmaeker, responsible for part of the choreography and dance vocabulary ("A Love Supreme" in the first production and "Raaj Khamaj" and "India" in the second). Salva Sanchis also participated as a dancer in these two productions. "A Love Supreme" was restaged by Salva Sanchis and Rosas in 2017 in a revised version. While he was associated with Rosas, he also produced some of his own choreographies: "Double Trio Live" (2005), "Variations in G" (2006) and "Still Live" (2007).

In the period that Salva Sanchis was associated with Rosas, his work was determined by research guided by musical sources. By working with jazz music, he developed a personal approach to the relationship between dance and music. After that, music (often live music) remained an important element in his choreographic work. He worked with musicians such as jazz saxophonist Bruno Vansina, avant-garde jazz pianist / composer <a href="Kris%20Defoort">Kris Defoort</a>, organist / composer <a href="Bernard%20Foccroulle">Bernard Foccroulle</a>, sound artist Peter Lenaerts, pianist Yutaka Oya and the duo Discodesafinado, that mixes minimal techno with experimental electronics. With Bernard Fouccroulle, Salva Sanchis created from 2008 under the title "The Organ Project" a series of dance shows with live organ music in different churches in Europe that have evolved into improvisations for four to five dancers. With Kris Defoort, he made the improvisation solo "Action" in 2010.

Latent Fuss and cooperation with kunst/werk.
After Salva Sanchis left Rosas, a short period followed in which he started his own organization (Latent Fuss vzw) to produce his transition work "Objects in mirror are closer than they appear" (2008). This is a production for four dancers and a musician that confronts pure movement with extraterrestrial abductions, Out of Body Experiences (OBE) and developments in cognitive neurology. In 2010, he switched to kunst/werk, a Belgian subsidized dance organization where he is responsible for artistic leadership together with Marc Vanrunxt. He produced choreographies such as "Now here" (2011), "Angle" (2012), "The Phantom Layer" (2013), "Islands" (2014) and "Radical Light" (2016). "Angle" and "Radical Light" are also performances in which music plays a crucial role. "Angle" is a solo in collaboration with pianist Yutaka Oya, who plays short compositions of <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Ligeti">György Ligeti</a>, <a href="John%20Cage">John Cage</a>, <a href="Luciano%20Berio">Luciano Berio</a>, <a href="Jo%20Kondo">Jo Kondo</a> and Keiko Harada. For "Radical Light", Salva Sanchis began a dialogue with the music of Discodesafinado (Senjan Jansen and Joris Vermeiren), resulting in a choreography that was completely based on the musical concept of 'pulse'.

Return to Spain.
In the first months of 2016, it became known that, after a stay of more than twenty years in Brussels, Salva Sanchis returned to his native region in Spain to complete his studies in psychology. In the meantime, he only wants to restage older choreographic work. The return to Spain also means his departure from kunst/werk.

Reception of choreographic work.
The choreographies that Salva Sanchis has created for kunst/werk and Latent Fuss vzw have toured in Belgium and abroad, especially "Radical Light" (Salva Sanchis, 2016), "Islands" (Salva Sanchis, 2014) and "Objects in mirror are closer than they appear" (Salva Sanchis, 2008). In Belgium (mainly in Flanders and Brussels), they were performed in the main theatres (Kaaitheater in Brussels, art centre STUK in Leuven, Monty and deSingel in Antwerp, Vooruit in Ghent, Concertgebouw in Bruges and art centre BUDA in Kortrijk), but also in cultural centres in smaller cities. Outside Belgium they were performed in Austria (Vienna), France (Lyon, Villeneuve D'ascq and Valenciennes), Hungary (Budapest), Italy (Firenze), the Netherlands (Rotterdam), Portugal (Lisbon) and Spain (Barcelona and Santiago de Compostela). In 2017, "Radical Light" was selected for the Flemish TheaterFestival. In 2018, "Radical Light" (Salva Sanchis, 2016) will be performed for six days at the Théâtre de la Bastille in Paris. 

The revised version of "A Love Supreme" (Salva Sanchis and Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 2017) has even toured more intensely, with performances in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Italy since its premiere in April 2017. In 2017 and 2018, more performances will follow in Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United States. In 2017, the Rosas dancers José Paulo dos Santos, Bilal El Had, Jason Respilieux and Thomas Vantuycom were awarded the prix de la Critique by the French dance press for their performance in "A Love Supreme"(Salva Sanchis and Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker / Rosas, 2017).

Work as a teacher.
In parallel with his choreographic activities, Salva Sanchis has developed an extensive pedagogical career. He has given dance workshops in different countries. At the same time, he has been closely associated since 2004 with P.A.R.T.S., the dance school where he studied. He is one of the permanent teachers, and is also responsible for the selection of new students. In his work as a dance teacher, Salva Sanchis focuses on an eclectic technical approach to improvisation that is strongly linked to his own choreographic work.

Londesborough Barracks

Londesborough Barracks is a military installation in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Kingston upon Hull</a>.
History.
The building was designed as the headquarters of the 1st Yorkshire East Riding Rifle Volunteer Corps and was completed in 1864. The barracks were named after <a href="William%20Denison%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Londesborough">Lord Londesborough</a>, honorary colonel of the corps. This unit evolved to become the 1st Volunteer Battalion, The <a href="East%20Yorkshire%20Regiment">East Yorkshire Regiment</a> in 1883 and the 4th Battalion, The East Yorkshire Regiment in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. Elements of the 4th Battalion, The East Yorkshire Regiment continued to use the drill hall until the battalion amalgamated with the 5th Battalion The <a href="West%20Yorkshire%20Regiment">West Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own)</a> to form the 3rd Battalion the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%27s%20Own%20Regiment%20of%20Yorkshire">Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire</a> in 1960. After the new battalion was established at Lumley Barracks in York, the barracks were handed over to the <a href="Royal%20Logistic%20Corps">Royal Logistic Corps</a> ('RLC') and <a href="150%20Regiment%20RLC">150 Regiment RLC</a> was formed at Londesborough Barracks in 1967. The barracks remain the headquarters of 150 Regiment RLC and provide training facilities for 523 (Hull) Headquarters Squadron RLC.

2017 North Korea crisis

In 2017, <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> rapidly improved <a href="North%20Korea%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction">its nuclear weapons capability</a>, escalating tensions against the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and its allies. North Korea successfully conducted a series of <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a> (ICBM) tests and began threatening to attack the territories of the U.S. and <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>. U.S. President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> said that military solutions are "locked and loaded" against the North Korea threat.

Former <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Nations">U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations</a> <a href="John%20R.%20Bolton">John Bolton</a> and former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">U.S. Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Leon%20Panetta">Leon Panetta</a> stated that the standoff between the U.S. and North Korea over <a href="Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a>'s nuclear weapons program is comparable to the <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>.

Background.
North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
In his New Year’s Day speech, <a href="Kim%20Jong-un">Kim Jong-un</a>, the leader of North Korea, claimed that his country is in the “last stage” of preparations to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

On May 3, North Korea issued a rare and harshly worded criticism of its chief ally, China, stating that "One must clearly understand that the D.P.R.K.'s line of access to nukes for the existence and development of the country can neither be changed nor shaken[...] And that the D.P.R.K. will never beg for the maintenance of friendship with China, risking its nuclear program which is as precious as its own life, no matter how valuable the friendship is... China should no longer try to test the limits of the D.P.R.K.'s patience[...] China had better ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless act of chopping down the pillar of the D.P.R.K.-China relations." The harsh commentary also accused the Chinese media (which is tightly controlled by the government) of dancing to the tune of the U.S.

In August 2017, the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" reported on a confidential assessment carried out by the U.S. <a href="Defense%20Intelligence%20Agency">Defense Intelligence Agency</a> which suggested that North Korea had successfully developed nuclear warheads for missiles that could reach the US mainland.

USS "Carl Vinson"s movements.
Following the April 3, 2017 <a href="2017%20Shayrat%20missile%20strike">U.S. missile strikes in Shayrat, Syria</a> in response to <a href="Khan%20Shaykhun%20chemical%20attack">the chemical attack</a>, tensions had mounted as <a href="Presidency%20of%20Donald%20Trump">President Trump</a> weighed further military options against North Korea's ballistic missile program. Trump said in an interview that he was sending a "powerful armada", consisting of the <a href="supercarrier">supercarrier</a> and <a href="Carrier%20Strike%20Group%201">its carrier strike group</a>, to Korea. In the second week of April 2017, global media outlets erroneously reported that the USS "Carl Vinson" had been deployed to the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a> heading towards North Korea, as a result of confusion created by a "miscommunication" between the "Pentagon and the White House." A premature announcement on April 8 from the Navy led to a "glitch-ridden sequence of events". On April 17, North Korea's deputy <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> ambassador accused the United States of "turning the Korean peninsula into "the world's biggest hotspot" and the North Korean government stated "its readiness to declare war on the United States if North Korean forces were to be attacked." In reality on April 18, the "Carl Vinson" and its escorts were 3,500 miles from Korea engaged in scheduled joint <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> exercises in the Indian Ocean. On April 24 the Japanese destroyers <a href="JDS%20Ashigara">"Ashigara"</a> and "<a href="JS%20Samidare">Samidare</a>" participated with the USS "Carl Vinson" in tactical training drills near the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>; North Korea threatened to sink her with a single strike. The "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier had been in the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a> in 2015 and again in February 2017 on routine patrols. In late April 2017, Trump stated that "[t]here is a chance that we [The United States] could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea." 

Sanctions on North Korea.
American university student <a href="Otto%20Warmbier">Otto Warmbier</a> was freed from North Korea in June 2017, while in a coma after nearly 18 months of captivity. Warmbier died without regaining consciousness on June 19, 2017, six days after his return to the United States. Some U.S. officials blamed North Korea for his death. In July 2017, <a href="U.S.%20Secretary%20of%20State">U.S. Secretary of State</a> <a href="Rex%20Tillerson">Rex Tillerson</a> authorized a "Geographical Travel Restriction" which banned Americans from entering North Korea.

On July 4, 2017, North Korea successfully conducted its first test of an <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a> (ICBM), named <a href="Hwasong-14">Hwasong-14</a>. It conducted another test on July 28. On August 5, 2017, the UN unanimously imposed further sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear program. North Korea responded saying that it was a "violent violation of our sovereignty" and that it would make the US "pay the price for its crime... thousands of times".

THAAD in South Korea.
Against the North Korean missile threat, the <a href="United%20States%20Forces%20Korea">United States Forces Korea</a> (USFK) deployed <a href="Terminal%20High%20Altitude%20Area%20Defense">Terminal High Altitude Area Defense</a> (THAAD) in South Korea. It has faced strong oppositions from <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, and North Korea.

Timeline.
On August 8, 2017, President Donald Trump warned that North Korean nuclear threats "will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which the world has never seen before". North Korea responded by announcing that it was considering attacking US military bases in the <a href="US%20territory">US territory</a> of <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. 

On August 10, 2017, North Korean Lt. Gen. <a href="Kim%20Rak-gyom">Kim Rak-gyom</a> responded to Trump's speech of "fire and fury", saying his words are "nonsense" and asserting that "reasonable dialog" wasn't possible with Trump as president of the US. The North Korean governmental news agency <a href="Korean%20Central%20News%20Agency">KCNA</a> reported that Kim Jong-un's military will be able to fire four ICBMs, type <a href="Hwasong-12">Hwasong-12</a>, into the <a href="Philippine%20Sea">Philippine Sea</a> just 30-40 kilometres away from the island Guam itself. The flight time of their Hwasong-12 will be exactly 17 minutes and 45 seconds. (This plan could possibly be put into effect mid-August 2017, according to the KCNA). U.S. officials stated that <a href="Joseph%20Y.%20Yun">Joseph Y. Yun</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Special%20Representative%20for%20North%20Korea%20Policy">US envoy for North Korea policy</a>, and <a href="Pak%20Song-il">Pak Song-il</a>, a senior North Korean diplomat at the country’s UN mission, were making regular contact during this dispute, through a conduit of communication they called the "New York channel".

On August 14, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>'s Chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, <a href="Oleksandr%20Turchynov">Oleksandr Turchynov</a> denied that it had ever supplied defense technology to North Korea, responding to an article in the New York Times that said North Korea may have purchased rocket engines from Ukrainian factory <a href="Yuzhmash">Yuzhmash</a>, who have also denied the report.

On August 15, the North Korean leader had said he was delaying a decision on firing missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam while he waits to see what Trump does next, the North's state media says.

Reactions.
The reactions to the 2017 North Korea crisis include responses by political and religious leaders, media and the general public, within South Korea, Japan, the United States, and other nations, as well as by international organizations.

Privates (video game)

Privates is a <a href="freeware">freeware</a> <a href="Shoot%20%27em%20up">twin-stick shooter</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed and published by <a href="Size%20Five%20Games">Size Five Games</a> (formerly Zombie Cow Studios) and commissioned by <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> as a <a href="sex%20education">sex education</a> tool. It was published on August 6, 2010 for Windows.

The game received positive reception from critics and won a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> Award.

Gameplay.
The player plays as a squad of miniature <a href="Marines">Marines</a> wearing <a href="condom">condom</a> hats who are sent into various people's <a href="Vagina">vaginas</a> and <a href="Rectum">rectums</a>, as well as other parts of the body, in order to kill real-life <a href="Sexually%20transmitted%20infection">STD</a>s, which are depicted as monsters. The right weapons must be used to destroy them, which include <a href="Antibiotics">anti-bacterial</a> and <a href="Antiviral%20drug">anti-viral</a> guns. The player can order their squad, which consists of up to three additional Marines besides the player, to attack certain enemy types while they cover the others.

Plot.
The main character is Jack, who commands Foxtrot Squad, which has been deemed too useless by the "top brass" and is forced to embark on a dangerous mission with a combat veteran in the hopes that they will either "shape up" or die.

Development.
The game was funded by Channel 4, in order to promote safe sex for teenage boys. Developer Dan Marshall compared the game to "<a href="Gunstar%20Heroes">Gunstar Heroes</a>" in its design. He called his <a href="Google%20Search">Google Search</a> history when making the game "eclectic, horrific and embarrassing", saying that "if my ISP are snooping on me, they're presumably pretty concerned about my well-being", and saying that the game's artist was "constantly getting sent stuff he desperately didn't want to look at". He also said that his eyes were "opened" about sexual health, and realized how easy STDs were to transmit.

The game was rejected from release on the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> after being advised that it would fail peer review due to its overly sexual content. This decision was derided by critics, with <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> saying "I think it's very disturbing that we have a culture where deplorable violence is considered normal, but sex [...] is treated like something freakish and wrong".

Reception.
The game was positively received by critics. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> said that it was "genuinely refreshing to experience something that gets straight to the point" about sexual health, pointing to "frightening" statistics amongst teenagers. <a href="Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Shotgun">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> praised the game's writing and music, despite remarking on some audio issues.

The game was criticized by a feminist blog, Hoyden About Town, for being "<a href="Misogyny">misogynist</a>". In a counter-argument by Lewis Denby of <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a>, he said that the game does not try to send the message that women's genitals are "filthy and disease-ridden", but rather was a "great idea" due to its focus on sexual education, calling the article "tremendously bad reporting", but ultimately admitting the "the author has a point" and that humorous games about "serious issues" will always be open to criticism.

The ruins of Zavelstein Castle, a former <a href="hill%20castle">hill castle</a>, stand at on a <a href="hill%20spur">hill spur</a> above the <a href="Teinach">Teinach</a> valley on the southeastern edge of the municipality of <a href="Bad%20Teinach-Zavelstein">Bad Teinach-Zavelstein</a> in the county of <a href="Landkreis%20Calw">Calw</a> in the south German state of <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>.

History.
Archaeological investigations revealed that the castle must have been built around the middle of the 13th century. The first written record of the castle dates to 1303, from which it is clear that a Herr Richelin, a knight in Zavelstein, had lived in the castle, probably from 1280. By 1311 Zavelstein surfaces in the documents as a <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a> castle and was thus owned by the <a href="House%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">counts of Württemberg</a>. Together with their lordship of the castles of <a href="Schloss%20Neuenb%C3%BCrg">Neuenbürg</a>, <a href="Calw%20Castle">Calw</a>, <a href="Fautsberg%20Castle">Fautsberg</a>, <a href="Wildberg%2C%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg%23Structures">Wildberg</a> and <a href="Hohennagold%20Castle">Nagold</a>, they were able to maintain their influence over the newly acquired territories in the northeastern <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>. 

In the 14th century, the castle was frequently let out as a <a href="fief">fief</a> or used as a security. In 1342, Paul of Giltlingen sold the fief of the castle for 1,530 pounds of <a href="Heller%20%28coin%29">heller</a>s to Count Götz of Tübingen. Three years later Zavelstein was transferred for a pledge of 5,000 pounds of hellers from Count <a href="Ulrich%20IV%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Ulrich IV</a> and <a href="Eberhard%20II%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Eberhard II of Württemberg</a> to Count Palatine William <a href="County%20Palatine%20of%20T%C3%BCbingen">of Tübingen</a>. Because William died one year later without issue, Zavelstein returned to Württemberg in accordance with the contract. The castle became a "<a href="Leibgedinge">Leibgedinge</a>" in 1365 for William's brother, Götz of Tubingen, but he gave it up just one year later.
Zavelstein Castle gained significance in 1367, when the Count of Württemberg Eberhard II, the Whiner ("der Greiner") and his son, <a href="Ulrich%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Ulrich</a>, were able to escape to the castle from an ambush in the Wildbad by the House of <a href="Martinsv%C3%B6gel">Martinsvögel</a>. Due to the poor financial situation of the House of Württemberg the fief of the Barony of Zavelstein was constantly extended.

From a 1396 deed, it is clear that the pledge to Gerhard of Straubenhardt had passed down to his legal successors, Straub of Straubenhardt and Schimpf <a href="House%20of%20G%C3%BCltlingen">Gültlingen</a>. It was not until 1468 that Burkhard von Ehingen was given an order to settle the income of the castle and town of Zavelstein for 2,600 guilders. The knights of Ehingen held ownership rights until 1552. During the Peasant Wars, the castle was damaged in 1525 but not occupied. Duke Christopher of Württemberg redeemed the pledge in 1552 from Hans of Ehingen

In 1554, Jordan of Braitenbach on Roßnitz was enfeoffed with the castle. From 1554 to 1589, he repaired the castle facilities for 3,500 guilders, as can be seen from the bills for construction work. After his death in 1593, his widow Agnes of Braitenbach presumably continued to live there. After her death in 1612, the fief was transferred by <a href="John%20Frederick%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">John Frederick of Württemberg</a> to "<a href="Freiherr">Freiherr</a>" Benjamin Buwinghausen of Wallmerode. In 1620 the "Freiherr" of Zavelstein bought it and began extensive building work that lasted until 1630. During this time, the castle was rebuilt into a "<a href="schloss">schloss</a>". In 1634, the castle was plundered after the <a href="Battle%20of%20N%C3%B6rdlingen">Battle of Nördlingen</a>. After the baron died of the plague in 1635 in <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, his son James Frederick Buwinghausen took possession of the property. He subsequently became well known as the "<a href="Vogt">Obervogt</a>" of <a href="Calw">Calw</a>, especially in connexion with witch trials. In 1686, Eberhard Frederick Buwinghausen took possession of the estate as well as his father's offices.

Following the destruction of <a href="Hirsau">Hirsau</a> and Calw, Zavelstein was destroyed in 1692 by French troops under <a href="Ez%C3%A9chiel%20du%20Mas%2C%20Comte%20de%20M%C3%A9lac">Melac</a>. Only a few parts of the castle remained habitable, but Zavelstein was abandoned by the Buwinghausens. Eberhard Frederick Buwinghausen sold the estate to Duke <a href="Eberhard%20Louis%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Eberhard Louis of Württemberg</a> in 1710 for 20,000 guilders. However, the castle was not rebuilt and remained a ruin. In 1844, the stairs of the "<a href="bergfried">bergfried</a>" were renewed and its has been used since as a <a href="viewing%20tower">viewing tower</a>. In 1991, archaeological investigations were carried out during reconstruction work.

Biography.
Born in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, to Brooks and Kathaniel Walker Scott, Scott attended Queens College from 1974 to 1976 and studied at <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York%20at%20Old%20Westbury">State University of New York at Old Westbury</a>, graduating in 1979.

He auditioned for Sun Ra in July 1979, having first heard the Arkestra at the Beacon Theatre in 1977–78, when, as Scott said in a 2011 interview, he "immediately decided that membership in the Arkestra would be my life's dream." He subsequently began recording and touring with the Sun Ra Arkestra.

Between 1981 and 1988, Scott worked with a variety of musicians including <a href="Olu%20Dara">Olu Dara</a>, Seleno Clarke, Bobby Forrester, <a href="Jack%20McDuff">Jack McDuff</a>, <a href="Andy%20Razaf">Andy Razaf</a>, Freddie Drew, <a href="Nat%20Williams">Nat Williams</a>, <a href="Don%20Pullen">Don Pullen</a> and <a href="John%20Hicks">John Hicks</a>, Larry "'88 keys" Keyes, Jimmy "Preacher" Robbins, <a href="Charles%20Earland">Charles Earland</a>, <a href="Victor%20Davis">Victor Davis</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Turrentine">Tommy Turrentine</a>, <a href="Jerry%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Jerry González</a>, Bucky Thorpe, Panama Wallace, Buddy Mack, Jann Parker, <a href="Leon%20Thomas">Leon Thomas</a>, and many others.

Reviewing a 2015 appearance by Scott at the <a href="100%20Club">100 Club</a> in London, Kevin Le Gendre wrote: "Although his main CV credit, mainstay of the Sun Ra Arkestra for the best part of four decades, may suggest that he comes from one of the most singular of locations on the landscape of African-American music, the saxophonist unveils a much wider set of references. In his tails and engaging stage presence we see a shade of Cab Calloway; in the unabashed romanticism of his singing, particularly on the second set highlight 'Don't Misunderstand' we feel the spirit of Nat 'King' Cole; and in the bulk of the material we hear extensions of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie’s bebop innovations... Scott, and this is the most impressive thing about the performance, provides an all too rare display of how all of the aforesaid disparate historic characters are part of a bigger, coherent story."

S. Talageri

S. Talageri, or Shrikant Gangadhar Talageri, born in 1958, is an author and scholar. He is known for his books on the Rig Veda, the Avesta and the history of India.

In his work "The Rig Veda", Talageri gives a critique of Witzel's interpretation of the structure and the history depicted by the Rig Veda. Witzel responded in a later review while the debate was reviewed by <a href="Koenraad%20Elst">Koenraad Elst</a> in his book "Update on the Aryan Invasion Debate" (1999; ). Talageri's first book (1993) was criticized by the archaeologist George Erdosy and, in his wake, by the Indologist Witzel in 1995. Talageri wrote a critique of a number of scholars such as Griffith, Pargiter, Tilak and Aurobindo in his book on the Rig Veda. In Chapter 9, he singled out Michael Witzel's (1995) interpretation of the structure and history of the Rig Veda. In this chapter, Talageri alleges "Professor Witzel inventing evidence, suppressing inconvenient data, following an inconsistent methodology, retrofitting data into pre-conceived notions, contradicting himself again and again, and using misleading language". Witzel later wrote a review of Talageri's book. He based it on Talageris' alleged ignorance of the long-established structure of the Rigveda (Oldenberg 1888, English 2003. Talageri also uses the purportedly late Vedic <a href="Anukramani">Anukramani</a> (a list of poets, deities and meters) in analyzing the text of the Rigveda that is, per current scholarly consensus, and challenged by Talageri, hundreds of years earlier. It should be noted that Talageri's central thesis is to recast the chronology of the Rg Vedic texts. His conclusions (revision of Aryan Invasion theory, etc.) follows from this alternative history. Talageri considers his evidence unaddressed by Witzel, and the debate seems to have taken on the aspect of two scholars talking past each other. The debate was reviewed by <a href="Koenraad%20Elst">Koenraad Elst</a> in his book "Update on the Aryan Invasion Debate" (1999; ), points out that the review added little new to the discourse, with Witzel mostly rehashing his original scholarship.

S. Anna Gordon

S. Anna Gordon (born January 9, 1832) was a physician and author of "Camping in Colorado with Suggestions to Gold Seekers, Tourists and Invalids" (1879).

Early life.
S. Anna Gordon was born in <a href="Charlemont%2C%20Massachusetts">Charlemont, Massachusetts</a>, on January 9, 1832. On her father's side she was a descendant of John Steele Sr (1591-1665), who established the town, now city, of <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>. Among the distinguished persons in her family lineage was <a href="Noah%20Webster">Noah Webster</a>, the son of Noah Webster Sr. and Mercy Steele, a descendant of Governor <a href="William%20Bradford%20%28Plymouth%20governor%29">William Bradford</a> of <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth Colony</a>. On her mother's side she is a descendant of William Ward, of <a href="Sudbury%2C%20Massachusetts">Sudbury, Massachusetts</a>, many of whose descendants won historic distinction as military men and statesmen. 

When Gordon was young, her parents moved to New York, where she was reared and took the first year of a college course of study, which was afterwards completed in Illinois. 

Gordon graduated in 1889 with honors from the <a href="Drexel%20University%20College%20of%20Medicine">Hahnemann Medical College</a> of Chicago.

Career.
Before marrying, S. Anna Gordon had charge of the ladies' department in <a href="Mount%20Morris%20College">Rock River Seminary</a>, and subsequently the same position was twice tendered her in <a href="Ripon%20College%20%28Wisconsin%29">Ripon College (Wisconsin)</a>. She was offered the posistion of principal of the newly formed <a href="Wisconsin%20State%20College%20of%20Milwaukee">State Normal school of Wisconsin</a>. She attended teachers' institutes, wherever held throughout the State, for the purpose of agitating the subject of a normal school, until the desire became an object accomplished. 

After her marriage Gordon immediately commenced the study of medicine with her husband, attended a partial course of lectures, and was called upon by the people to assist him in an overburdening practice. 

In 1859 and i860 the Gordons were connected with the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, taking meteorological notes and making collections for the same. 

Gordon filled an engagement of one year as associate editor on the "Central Wisconsin", and then joined her husband in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, where he was stationed most of the time during the Civil War. 

In Louisville Gordon gave considerable time to the study of art, the remaining time being devoted to the relief of the suffering soldiers around her. Situated near her husband's headquarters at one time was a camp of homeless southern refugees, overtaken by the smallpox. They could find no physician to serve them. Gordon's husband was prohibited both by want of time and the exposures it would bring to the soldiers. She learned of their pitiful condition and at once went to their relief and fought the scourge until it vanished. 

Gordon served her husband as hospital officer in different capacities as unavoidable circumstances created vacancies not readily supplied. 

Gordon was a weekly contributor to the literary columns of the Louisville "Sunday Journal" during the war. She has been a member of the <a href="Dante%20Society%20of%20America">Dante Society of America</a> since its organization, and in 1882 and 1883 was State editor for the Missouri <a href="Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union">Woman's Christian Temperance Union</a> on the Chicago "Signal". 

During a residence in <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, Colorado, Gordon was the first person to suggest the demand for the newsboys' home there, which she had the opportunity of aiding in establishing. She was also assistant superintendent of Chinese work in that city for some time. 

Gordon was the author of: "Music of Waters", "Missing Gems", "Pebbles", "Camping in Colorado with Suggestions to Gold Seekers, Tourists and Invalids" (1879, The Author's Publishing Company, 1st edition, 1882, W B Smith & Co., New York, 2nd edition), and several papers and poems that have entered into other collections. "Camping in Colorado" descrived her and her family's adventures as they camped in the Rocky Mountains near Denver: "At the gates of the park we discovered an open cabin. It was built of unhewn logs, and covered with earth. The windows were gone, and the paths that once led to it were overgrown with bramble. We learned that this had been the home of Mountain Jim, who, during his life, had been known as trapper, hunter, fishman, and more. The desolate cabin still serves as a monument to his memory; and it is pointed out to strangers, the thrilling of this strange life and tragic death are related; all of which have become historically associated with the park" --S. Anna Gordon.

In medicine Gordon was a homceopathist. 

Personal life.
S. Anna Gordon married in 1858, W. A. Gordon, M. D., of <a href="Wausau%2C%20Wisconsin">Wausau, Wisconsin</a>. After the Civil War they moved to <a href="Hannibal%2C%20Missouri">Hannibal, Missouri</a>.

Marie von Flotow

Marie von Flotow was a Russian courtier, the influential favorite of the Russian empress <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)</a>.

Marie von Flotow belonged to a rich German aristocratic family by the name von Gerschau. She served for a period in the household of <a href="Louise%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Louise of Hesse-Kassel</a>, before she was employed in the household of Louise's daughter Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark), who married the future tsar <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III of Russia</a> in 1866 and became empress in 1881.

Marie von Flotow was formally the <a href="lady%27s%20maid">lady's maid</a> of the empress, with the responsibility of her jewels and wardrobe and the payment of her bills. In addition to her formal position, however, she was also the favorite and confidante of Marie Feodorovna, which gave her a great deal of influence at the imperial court and gave her a position of "paramount influence". She kept this position also after Maria Feodorovna became a widow.

The influence of Marie von Flotow during the reign of tsar Nicholas II is described by <a href="Aleksandr%20Mosolov%20Methuen">Aleksandr Mosolov Methuen</a>: "Marie Feodorovna could not refuse anything to the members of her suite.. And Nicholas II agreed to everything that his mother asked. The consequence was that most of the appointments at Court were made through the channel of the Empress Dowager's Court. She had a Lady in Waiting, Mme Flotow. This lady was officially responsible for the care of her mistress's jewels and wardrobe; but she had succeeded in gaining a position of altogether extravagant influence. As soon as the name of Mme Flotow was to be found in the papers of an applicant it was a foregone conclusion that the Tsar would grant the request, even if at first he was for rejecting it. Somehow, I do not know how, Mme Flotow would know all about the Sovereign's decisions, at times well before the writer of these pages!"

Robinson Barekaldo

De Souza Jack Robinson Barekaldo (known simply as 'Bijan'), born October 1992, is a Brazilian footballer of mixed Iranian and Grenadine heritage. He is currently without a club.

Club career

Robinson Barekaldo began his career at Iranian second-tier club Aluminium Hormozgan in the 2006/2007 season, where his stellar performances for the club's under-18 side earned him a call-up to the senior team at the age of just 14. However, he did not make a single league appearance for the club. He signed a contract with Iran Pro League side Paykan FC in the summer of 2007. During his time at Aluminum Hormozgan, Barekaldo wore the no. 55 shirt. 

Barekaldo was a key figure in Paykan Under-18's team for the next two years. His performances drew attention from scouts from all over the world, and there were rumours he might feature for the first team. Barekaldo left Paykan FC in the summer of 2009, having not made a single league appearance for the club. Now aged 17, he signed a professional contract with Brazilian third-tier club Novo Hamburgo, where he was given the no. 55 shirt that had by now become his trademark. 

Barekaldo's first year in Brazil was blighted by injury. He suffered an ankle ligament injury that caused him to miss the 2009/2010 season in its entirety. At the start of the 2010/2011 season, Barekaldo suffered light injuries in a car accident, which caused him to miss a number of games. He featured prominently for Novo Hamburgo's reserve team in the 2010/2011. It was during this season that he came to wider attention as a result of having scored directly from a corner in a reserve match. Footage of the goal was uploaded to YouTube by a supporter who had captured it on his mobile phone. It was briefly a viral sensation before the clip was deleted for breaching copyright laws pertaining to the broadcast of third-tier Brazilian reserve league matches. In the summer of 2011 Barekaldo was linked with a transfer to Portuguese club Vitoria Setubal, but this did not materialise. 

In the first week of the 2011/2012 season, Barekaldo was on the verge of making his senior debut for Novo Hamburgo when he was unexpectedly signed by Arabian Gulf League club Hatta. It was at this point that Barekaldo was invited to play for the St Vincent & the Grenadines national team in a FIFA-approved friendly. Barekaldo declined the offer, as he held out hopes of appearing for Iran. Midway through the 2011/2012 season, Barekaldo was unexpectedly released by his club, for reasons which remain a mystery. He had not made a single senior appearance for the club. Now aged 19, Barekaldo returned to his native Iran and stayed fit by training with Aluminium Hormozgan. At the start of the 2012/2013 season, Barekaldo signed a two-year deal with Nigerian club Police Machine FC, where he was given the no. 55 shirt. He was on the verge of making his first appearance for the club when, in August 2012, he contracted ebola and was hospitalised. Fortunately, Barekaldo made a full recovery. However, he found it difficult to break into the first team, and was allowed to leave the club after just one year of his contract. 

At the start of the 2013/2014 season, Barekaldo signed a pay-as-you-play contract with Thai club TTM Thailand Tobacco Monopoly FC, where he was given the no. 55 shirt. He made several appearances for the club's reserve team, and became a cult figure among supporters for the eye-catching orange mohawk he sported at this time. Unfortunately he was unable to break into the first team and, at the start of the the 2014/15, he left the club, having failed to make a single senior appearance. That summer, Barekaldo was heavily linked with a number of top Iranian clubs, but a transfer did not materialise. He is believed to have had a trial with Chinese club Gangzhou Evergrande, but this cannot be verified. In the summer of 2016, Barekaldo almost signed for English non-league club Kingstonian, but the transfer fell through for work permit reasons. In the summer of 2017 Barekaldo was linked with several Indian Super League Clubs. 

Style of play 

Barekaldo is an attacking midfielder or trequarista, though in his early days in Iran he was known to play as a traditional striker.
Personal life

Barekaldo is single. He owns a dog called Kleberson, named after Brazil's 2002 World Cup-winning defensive midfielder.

Karrle Tu Bhi Mohabbat is a 2017 <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> <a href="web%20series">web series</a>, produced by <a href="Ekta%20Kapoor">Ekta Kapoor</a> for her <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> platform <a href="ALTBalaji">ALTBalaji</a>. It stars one of the most popular TV couples <a href="Ram%20Kapoor">Ram Kapoor</a> and <a href="Sakshi%20Tanwar">Sakshi Tanwar</a> as Protagonists. The web series is about two opposite people falling in love with each other.

The series is available for streaming on the <a href="ALTBalaji">ALT Balaji</a> App and its associated websites since its release date.

Plot.
Karan Khanna (<a href="Ram%20Kapoor">Ram Kapoor</a>) is a superstar who is recovering from getting rid of alcohol, who, along with his counsellor Tripurasundari Nagrajan (<a href="Sakshi%20Tanwar">Sakshi Tanwar</a>), takes a detoxification trip to Mahabaleshwar. The story takes a turn when he attends his estranged daughter's wedding with Tripurasundari Nagrajan and discovers why opposites truly attract. The show explores how their romance blossoms and thrills the audience with their contrasting lives.


Reception.
Bollywoodlife reviewed the show 4.5/5 and stated, "Karrle Tu Bhi Mohabbat is a love story of two middle-aged people who eventually fall in love with each other and make each other better human beings. Though it starts off on a dry note, the show gets more interesting with Ram Kapoor’s witty lines. You’ll get nostalgic seeing these two back onscreen with each other and will definitely want to watch their love grow. Ram and Sakshi’s chemistry is worth a watch and their equation with each other in the series will surely teach you a thing or two about relationships and how imperfectly perfectly two people can be for each other."

Bollywoodgram gave 4.5/5 stars and stated "The story is fast paced and there are no low points in the show, except one maybe. The awards show in the first episode seems pretty fabricated and causes one to lose connect with an otherwise engaging series. Both <a href="Sakshi%20Tanwar">Sakshi Tanwar</a> and <a href="Ram%20Kapoor">Ram Kapoor</a> easily slip into their roles and remind us of the larger than life chemistry they shared in the popular television series, <a href="Bade%20Achhe%20Lagte%20Hain">Bade Achhe Lagte Hain</a>."

Jami Kampung Baru Inpak Mosque

Masjid Jami Kampung Baru Inpak, also known as Masjid Kampung Baru or Bandengan Mosque is one of the oldest mosque in <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. It is located at Jalan Bandengan Selatan, Pekojan, <a href="Tambora%2C%20Jakarta">Tambora, Jakarta</a>, close to <a href="Masjid%20Al-Anshor">Masjid Al-Anshor</a>. It is one of the mosque that was built by the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> merchants from <a href="India">India</a>, who used to travel and live in <a href="Batavia">Batavia</a>. The mosque has been designated as a cultural heritage by the provincial government of DKI Jakarta.

History.
The traders and merchants from Arabia and India settled in this region of then <a href="Batavia">Batavia</a>. Traders from India built a mosque in the area to meet their need to perform worship in congregation. Jami Kampung Baru Mosque was built by Syeikh Abubakar who is one of the Muslim merchants from India and who lived in the area. Construction began in 1743 and completed in 1748.In a Dutch article in 1829 the New Kampong mosque is also called the "Moorsche Tempel" (Temple of the Moors). It is probably from this historical origin that the mosque was built by Muslim Moors, later the Moorish term is identified as Indian Muslims. Although Moorish terminology use to identify a Muslim ethnic group in North Africa (Morocco and its surroundings), who in his time succeeded in conquering Europe and establishing an empire of Islam in Andalusia (Spain).

Architecture.
At present the building is not in the original shape, except the remaining keranka central square, carved setandan grapes and some pillars on the windows. In the late 1980s, the old buildings in Pekojan area were dismantled for a flyover. Kampung Baru Mosque also suffered damage from the improvement effort regardless of historical values and architecture. The basic plan of the mosque is in the form of a square with a roof overlap (overlapping), the upper roof is a pyramid shape. The shape of this mosque resembles traditional <a href="Javanese">Javanese</a> building forms, where there are usually 4 pillars of soko guru in the middle of the building as a buffer of the pyramid-shaped roof.

The area of the mosque is about 1,050 square meters, the floor is covered with a white-colored head and over it spread a green colored mat and partly red colored bewarna. In the sky the mosque hangs an antic lamp that has been there since the mosque was standing. This mosque once had the most beautiful pulpit, made of carved wood. The pulpit has been replaced. The original pulpit is now stored in the <a href="Jakarta%20History%20Museum">Jakarta History Museum</a>.

<doc id="54864881" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54864881" title="Arlberg Schnellstraße">
Arlberg Schnellstraße

The Arlberg Schnellstraße (S16) is an expressway ("Schnellstraße") in <a href="Austria">Austria</a> that is part of the <a href="European%20route%20E60">E 60</a>. It runs along a length of 62.2 km between <a href="Zams">Zams</a> and <a href="Bludenz">Bludenz</a> and connects the <a href="Inn%20Valley%20Autobahn">Inn Valley Autobahn</a> (A12) in <a href="Tyrol%20%28state%29">Tyrol</a> with the <a href="Rheintal/Walgau%20Autobahn">Rheintal/Walgau Autobahn</a> (A14) in <a href="Vorarlberg">Vorarlberg</a>. The border between the two states is located in the <a href="Arlberg%20Road%20Tunnel">Arlberg Tunnel</a> (toll), which is 13,972 m long and is also the <a href="List%20of%20tunnels%20in%20Austria">longest road tunnel in Austria</a>. Overall, more than half of the route runs in long tunnels.

History.
After the  section from Bludenz to Braz opened from 1969 to 1972, the Arlberg Tunnel, opened in December of 1978, was the next completed part. Further construction took place over a number of years. Only in 2006 was the last gap closed with the <a href="Strenger%20Tunnel">Strenger Tunnel</a>.

Cross-section of the road.
In the course of the Arlberg Schnellstraße, the cross-section of the road is often changing. While on the eastern tunnel approach, with the exception of the <a href="Zammer%20Tunnel%20%28Schnellstra%C3%9Fe%29">Zammer-</a> and <a href="Perjentunnel">Perjentunnels</a>, the entire route is carried out at least with a <a href="2%2B1%20road">2 + 1 traffic route</a> (three lanes with alternating passing lanes), a large part of the western approach is only two lanes with an overtaking prohibition. However, since the speed limit of 80 km/h and the overtaking prohibition are frequently ignored in this area, serious accidents occur again and again. This makes the S 16 one of the most accident-rich roads in Austria and is therefore often locally referred to as the "death route." The <a href="ASFiNAG">ASFINAG</a> therefore sent a <a href="Dowsing">dowser</a> to "suppress" this area, since there are allegedly "earth rays" and "fields of force stones", which would supposedly lead to sudden blood pressure drops and microsleep in drivers. However, the effectiveness of this measure is controversial. 


Expansion projects.
The Perjentunnel will receive a second tube by 2018, after which the existing tube will be renovated by 2020. The route between the Perjentunnel and Zams is to be expanded to four lanes by 2025, so that the eastern approach will only have less than four lanes in the area between Flirsch and Pettneu. A four-lane expansion of the western approach, as planned in the meantime, was canceled due to low traffic load.

Germain Pinel

Germain Pinel (Paris, c.1600 – October 1661) was a French <a href="lute">lute</a>nist and composer.

Biography.
His father Pierre Pinel was himself a lutenist, like several other members of the family (especially his younger brother <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pinel">François Pinel</a>) and his three sons Jean-Baptiste, Jean and Séraphin.

Germain was quoted as master of <a href="lute">lute</a> in 1630. He entered the service of <a href="Marguerite%20of%20Lorraine">Marguerite of Lorraine</a> Duchess of Orléans in 1645. From 1647, he was called to teach the lute to the young <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a>, aged 9.

He was one of the musicians of the King's Chamber for the lute and <a href="theorbo">theorbo</a> from 1656 on. With wages of up to 2000 <a href="Livre%20tournois">livres tournois</a>, he was one of the leading musicians. His succession shows that he had a very comfortable lifestyle.

In 1658, his post passed to his son Séraphin, who, despite his promising debut, no longer appeared as a lutenist after his father's death in 1661.

Germain Pinel's music.
Over 80 pieces for the lute and an <a href="unmeasured%20prelude">unmeasured prelude</a> for theorbo attributed to Pinel have reached us. One-third of these works come from the manuscript Ms. Schwerin 641, written c. 1651. It was written with two hands, one of which could be that of Pinel himself.

Most of his compositions are dances: <a href="allemande">allemande</a>s, <a href="courante">courante</a>s, <a href="sarabande">sarabande</a>s and <a href="gigue">gigue</a>s.

He is quoted by the master of Mary Burwell, who said of him, after his death, that "his play was gay and melodious, he composed his plays with great ease." <a href="Ennemond%20Gaultier">Ennemond "Old" Gaultier</a> himself cited him as one of the masters of his time.

In 2014 the Franco-Portuguese luthist devoted a record to him for the Dutch label <a href="Brilliant%20Classics">Brilliant Classics</a>, entitled "les-rois-de-versailles".

Everything's 13

Everything's 13 is a United Kingdom based registered educational and humanitarian <a href="Charities">charity</a> founded by <a href="Jagraj%20Singh">Jagraj Singh</a> (1979-2017), CEO of <a href="Basics%20of%20Sikhi">Basics of Sikhi</a> (BoS), in 2011. . It operates in Europe, North America, India and Australia. They have produced an app, over 1000 videos, and translated their content into 20 languages. Its YouTube channel has over 16 million views. 

Name.
"Everything's 13" utilizes a phonetic trick to transliterate "Everything is Yours" from Punjabi to English. According to the foundation website:

"13 has special significance in Sikh philosophy. In Punjabi, it is pronounced as “Tera” which sounds the same as “Yours”. The Gurus and renowned Saints used “Yours” to refer to the Supreme Creator. Everythings 13 therefore translates to “Everything is yours God” 

Founder.
Singh attended secondary school in Hounslow, west London. An Oxford graduate in Philosophy, Politics and Eonomics, Jagraj is also an ex-British Army officer. Singh's work was acknowledged by Sikh leaders around the world and also by the British government, who awarded Everythings 13 with a Points of Light community award. He trained dozens of parchariks and had spoken at camps and events worldwide. Jagraj Singh had talked to London passerbyers, engaging them in spiritual conversation. Along with Basics of Sikhi, some of the other initiatives launched by him include the Amritsar Visitor Center, Sikh Press Association and the Mightly Khalsa project. Mighty Khalsa is a Sikh kids orientated educational books, games and apps project. The Sikh Press Association is a media facing project providing publicity for the Panth. The project runs positive PR campaigns to raise the profile of Sikhs in the mainstream.

In his final interview with BBC Radio London (94.9 FM), Bhai Jagraj Singh revealed that they raised £225,000 for a Sikh visitor centre in Amritsar, India. In a personal letter to Singh, British Prime Minister Theresa May said: "Your important work is doing much to positively engage both young Sikhs and the wider community with your faith. You are inspiring those of all faiths and none to make a difference with their lives."
He passed away on July 20, 2017 at the age of 38 due to complications of inoperable fourth stage liver cancer. He is survived by his children and wife, Sukhmani Kaur (who runs Mighty Khalsa and Kiddie Sangat).

They included a number of islands they would visit in the <a href="Dampier%20Archipelago">Dampier Archipelago</a>.

History of contact with whites.
It is believed that the first contact with whites occurred on 26 February 1818 during the explorer <a href="Philip%20Parker%20King">Philip Parker King</a>'s first voyage in the <a href="HMS%20Mermaid%20%281817%29">HMS Mermaid</a>, which took him to the north-western coast of Australia. King describes the scene:
As we advanced, three natives were seen in the water,apparently wading from an island in the centre of the strait towards Lewis Island: the course was immediately altered to intercept them, but as we approached, it was discovered that each native was seated on a log of wood, which he propelled through the water by paddling with his hands. Having hove to, close by them, they became much alarmed, and cried out in loud tones, which were increased when our boat was lowered and despatched after them; but it was not without the greatest difficulty that Mr. Bedwell succeeded in bringing one on board. On the boat's coming up with the nearest Indian, he left his log and, diving under the boat's bottom, swam astern; this he did whenever the boat approached him, and it was four or five minutes before he was caught, which was at last effected by seizing him by the hair, in the act of diving, and dragging him into the boat, against which he resisted stoutly, and, even when taken, it required two men to hold him to prevent his escape. During the interval of heaving to and bringing him on board, the cutter was anchored near the central island, where a tribe of natives were collected, consisting of about forty persons, of whom the greater number were women and children; the whole party appeared to be overcome with grief, particularly the women, who most loudly and vehemently expressed their sorrow by cries, and rolling on the ground, and covering their bodies with the sand.
Once on board, the captive, a six foot tall lad in his early twenties, <a href="scarification">scarified</a> with horizontal strips from his chest to his navel, but with no nose-piercing or tooth evulsion, was treated to sugared water, and, turning to the shore, cried out:"coma negra"!. He was allowed to return to his camp on his log - called a 'marine velocipede' whose construction from <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> roots was described in detail - with various gifts, such as a red cap, biscuits and an axe. On beaching, he was interrogated by his terrified companions, who held him at spear point, and then physically examined. A further bundle of gifts was delivered towards dusk.

Confederate Congressional elections, 1863

Elections to the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Congress">Confederate States Congress</a> were held from May to November 1863, during the first and last midterm of <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>' presidency. The number of Congressmen in the House of Representatives who openly opposed the policies of President Davis increased from 26 to 41 out of 106, while the number of antiadministration Senators went from 11 to 12. The proadministration Senators thus had a narrow majority of two with 14 out of the 26 seats in the Confederate Senate. The <a href="2nd%20Confederate%20States%20Congress">2nd Confederate States Congress</a> would be seated on May 2, 1864.

General election.
The Confederate government did not have formal parties, and candidates ran individual campaigns. Nonetheless, some voters cast their ballots according to past party affiliations such as <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> or <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a>. The lack of parties was popularly believed to be a source of strength, however historians believe that the lack of such organizations prevented Davis from distributing <a href="patronage">patronage</a> or commanding party loyalty from other <a href="elected%20officials">elected officials</a> to mobilize support for his policies. Despite this, historians have identified factions or proto-parties.
One was largely supportive of President Davis's policies, or proadministration, and the other was largely opposed to Davis' policies, or antiadministration. The antiadministration faction consisted of former <a href="Whigs">Whigs</a> as well as <a href="Fire-Eaters">Fire-Eaters</a> and other former <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a>. 

Public grievances with the administration included supply shortages, <a href="inflation">inflation</a>, and general financial mismanagement. Other issues that featured prominently in the elections were <a href="conscription">conscription</a> and <a href="taxation">taxation</a>. Antiadministration candidates decried perceived <a href="federal%20government">federal government</a> overreach, including Davis' decision to suspend <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a> and impose <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>. Proadministration officials attempted to appeal to the Confederate public's <a href="loyalty">loyalty</a> and foster a spirit of self-sacrifice for eventual <a href="independence">independence</a> of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>.

In the end, the proadministration faction sustained electoral losses but maintained their majorities in both chambers of the <a href="Confederate%20Congress">Confederate Congress</a>. Their strongest support came from <a href="Confederate%20Army">Confederate soldiers</a> and the <a href="Border%20States">Border States</a>. However, this was not without anti-incumbent sentiment. For example, nine of the ten members of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>'s Congressional delegation were defeated. In terms of policy, the overall sentiment of the antiadministration was in favor of the original <a href="secession">secession</a> and for continuing the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. Exceptions existed, as none of the newly elected Representatives from <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> had voted in favor of <a href="secession">secession</a>, while anti-secessionist former Whigs gained in <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. <a href="Williamson%20Robert%20Winfield%20Cobb">Williamson Robert Winfield Cobb</a> of <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> was so openly in favor of <a href="peace">peace</a> that he was not seated by the Confederate Congress. Overall, five candidates ran on a peace platform and won.

The elections were processed over six months due to the amount of Confederate territory occupied by the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>, in addition to all of the <a href="absentee%20ballots">absentee ballots</a> necessitated by the large <a href="refugee">refugee</a> population. <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, and <a href="Texas">Texas</a> sent 32 of the 41 antiadministration Congressmen to the House. The majority wielded by the Confederate Congress would not have been possible without the near unified support from the occupied districts. The results of the 1863 election indicating waning public confidence in the Davis administration, and enhanced the political strength of dissenters within the Confederacy.

Shah Jalal Mosque (Wales)

The Shah Jalal Mosque, officially the Shah Jalal Mosque & Islamic Cultural Centre is a listed place of worship in Cardiff, Wales. Originally built for Methodist Christians, it ceased as a church in the 1980s and is now a mosque.

History.
A Welsh Calvinistic Methodist presence in Cathays began in 1884, with the founding of "Capel Horeb", a small building on May Street. It owed its birth to the widening of Cardiff's boundaries in 1875, which had taken in more Welsh-language speakers in the areas around the city. In 1900, this building was closed and the congregation moved to a newer, more prominent location on nearby Crwys Road. The building is constructed in Pennant stone and Bath stone with dressings in yellow brick, and on completion, was named "Capel Heol y Crwys". The May Street building is now used by the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a>. In its early years, it was a very popular Welsh-speaking chapel, with regular congregations of 500, but as with many of Cardiff's suburban churches, its attendance declined in the late 20th Century, and maintenance costs became hard to meet. In 1988, the congregation moved into newer premises in Richmond Road, having acquired a building formerly used by Christian Scientists. It continues to operate at the location. In 1990, the old chapel underwent conversion into a mosque.

Recent Events.
The mosque became Grade II Listed on 21st August 1997.

Red Bull KTM Factory Racing is the official <a href="Factory-backed">factory team</a> of <a href="Red%20Bull">Red Bull</a> and <a href="KTM">KTM</a> in the <a href="Grand%20Prix%20motorcycle%20racing">MotoGP</a> World Championship.

History.
Development of the RC16.
Since <a href="KTM">KTM</a> have a dominant presence amongst most motorcycling motorsport, they wanted to tackle <a href="Grand%20Prix%20motorcycle%20racing">MotoGP</a> to show dominance in the highest form of motorcycle racing. 
In September of 2014, <a href="Pit%20Beirer">Pit Beirer</a> announced that KTM were to arrive in MotoGP at the start of <a href="2017%20MotoGP%20season">2017</a>, this was not easy as Beirer had to convince specialists engineers to come to KTM even though work on the project hadn't started.

A year and a half until their MotoGP debut, KTM tested their <a href="V4%20engine">V4 engine</a> for the first time, it was opted for the engine to be a V4 configuration (also known as a screamer engine) which was designed around the steel <a href="trellis%20frame">trellis frame</a> chassis that is iconic to KTM's brand and the only team to use this type of chassis.

In October 2015, the <a href="KTM%20RC16">KTM RC16</a> was tested on track for the first time at the <a href="Red%20Bull%20Ring">Red Bull Ring</a>, <a href="Alex%20Hofmann">Alex Hofmann</a> was the first test rider aboard the new bike. The team carried on with further testing of the bike at circuits such as <a href="Circuit%20Ricardo%20Tormo">Circuit Ricardo Tormo</a>, <a href="Circuito%20de%20Jerez">Circuito de Jerez</a>, <a href="Masaryk%20Circuit">Brno Circuit</a>, <a href="Misano%20World%20Circuit%20Marco%20Simoncelli">Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli</a> and <a href="Mugello%20Circuit">Mugello Circuit</a> whilst picking up valuable test riders, <a href="Mika%20Kallio">Mika Kallio</a>, <a href="Randy%20De%20Puniet">Randy De Puniet</a>, <a href="Karel%20Abraham">Karel Abraham</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Luthi">Thomas Luthi</a>.

Presentation and Wildcard.
The Red Bull KTM Factory Racing Team would present the KTM RC16 to the public for the first time before the start of the <a href="2016%20Austrian%20motorcycle%20Grand%20Prix">2016 Austrian GP</a> with test riders Kallio and Hofmann doing a couple of laps before announcing that Mika Kallio would have a wildcard entry for the <a href="2016%20Valencian%20Community%20motorcycle%20Grand%20Prix">2016 Valencian GP</a> aboard the RC16 making the official debut race for the machine and KTM into the MotoGP category.

From the 11th to 13th of November 2016, Mika Kallio would ride the KTM RC16 as a wildcard at the final race in Valencia. Kallio qualified in a respectable 20th place, ahead of full time riders <a href="Tito%20Rabat">Tito Rabat</a> and <a href="Yonny%20Hernandez">Yonny Hernandez</a>, After initially keeping up with pace during the opening stages of the race, the bike's rear wheel sensors had malfunctioned forcing Kallio to retire from the grand prix.

Final Testing.
<a href="Pol%20Espargar%C3%B3">Pol Espargaró</a> and <a href="Bradley%20Smith">Bradley Smith</a> immediately got onboard the RC15 during the first official winter test, just one day after the final grand prix of 2016 season at Valencia.This was the first time that the pair had ridden the KTM after coming from the <a href="Tech%203">Tech 3</a> team in which they had been team-mates for 3 years.

KTM would have a private test at the Jerez circuit towards the end of November. Due to Pol still being under contract with <a href="Yamaha%20Motor%20Racing">Yamaha</a> at the time, he was unable to test which meant that Mika Kallio would stand in for him. In January and Ferbruary, KTM took part in the official pre-season tests at <a href="Sepang%20International%20Circuit">Sepang International Circuit</a> and <a href="Phillip%20Island%20Grand%20Prix%20Circuit">Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit</a> as well as the final test at <a href="Losail%20International%20Circuit">Losail International Circuit</a> just two weeks before the first Grand Prix of <a href="2017%20MotoGP%20season">2017</a> that took place in March

The team unveil the bike at their headquarters at the end of February along with <a href="Ajo%20Motorsport">Red Bull KTM Ajo</a>'s <a href="Moto3">Moto3</a> title defender and their new <a href="Moto2">Moto2</a> KTM competitor.

Debut Season.
The Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team made their debut in the MotoGP category at the <a href="2017%20Qatar%20motorcycle%20Grand%20Prix">2017 Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix</a>. Despite Pol and Bradley qualifying in 22nd and 23rd, they were able to successfully complete KTM's first Grand Prix by finishing 16th and 17th just 6 seconds apart after overtaking <a href="Sam%20Lowes">Sam Lowes</a> during the race. The team would score their first points in only their second grand prix in Argentina by finishing 14th and 15th. Another milestone was achieved at 2017 French motorcycle Grand Prix as both KTMs would make it through to qualifying 2 automatically, Pol would qualify 8th and Bradley in 10th, Pol would finish in 12th place in the race which was the best result until Pol finished in 11th place in a chaotic <a href="2017%20Dutch%20TT">Dutch TT</a>, to add to another milestone, Pol was able to qualify 7th at the <a href="2017%20German%20motorcycle%20Grand%20Prix">2017 German motorcycle Grand Prix</a> in which Mika Kallio made his second appearance on the RC16 as a wildcard, Mika would finish 16th to <a href="Jack%20Miller%20%28motorcycle%20racer%29">Jack Miller</a> whilst Pol and Bradley collected more points.

Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa

The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (MOCAA or Zeitz MOCAA) is a contemporary art museum located at the <a href="Victoria%20%26amp%3B%20Alfred%20Waterfront">V&A Waterfront</a> in Cape Town, South Africa. Currently in its final stages of construction, it is set to become the largest museum of contemporary African art in the world. The museum's Executive Director and Chief Curator is Mark Coetzee, and the official opening is scheduled for the end of September 2017.

Inception & Development.
The not-for-profit museum was commissioned through a public/private partnership between the V&A Waterfront and German businessman, <a href="Jochen%20Zeitz">Jochen Zeitz</a>. The Waterfront invested over R500-million towards its construction and infrastructure development, and although not a shareholder, Zeitz provided his extensive art collection and will finance the running costs and budget for new acquisitions. Considered by many to be one of the world's leading collections of contemporary art from Africa and its diaspora, Zeitz's collection includes works by such eminent artists as <a href="Chris%20Ofili">Chris Ofili</a>, <a href="Kudzanai%20Chiurai">Kudzanai Chiurai</a>, <a href="Kehinde%20Wiley">Kehinde Wiley</a>, <a href="Glenn%20Ligon">Glenn Ligon</a>, <a href="Marlene%20Dumas">Marlene Dumas</a>, <a href="Wangechi%20Mutu">Wangechi Mutu</a>, and <a href="Julie%20Mehretu">Julie Mehretu</a>.

The Waterfront had been investigating a number of proposals regarding what to do with the historic Grain Silo since it was decommissioned in 2001. According to their CEO, David Green, the decision to transform and renovate the building for the new museum would "breathe life into the Silo district and act as a drawcard to a venture that is non-commercial in nature ... specifically for the enjoyment of all the continent’s citizens". While others have noted that the strategic partnership with Zeitz also serves to connect the existing properties of the Waterfronts's owners (Growthpoint Properties and the Government Employees Pension Fund) with the developing financial district in Cape Town's lower CBD. The conversion of the Silo building began in 2014 under the direction of London-based architect, <a href="Thomas%20Heatherwick">Thomas Heatherwick</a>.

Location & Architecture.
The museum is located in the <a href="Victoria%20%26amp%3B%20Alfred%20Waterfront">V&A Waterfront</a>, on the banks of <a href="Table%20Bay">Table Bay</a> overlooking the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The Waterfront is considered a prestigious retail and hospitality property, and already receives around 24-million visitors per year. The museum's immediate surroundings, the Silo District, is also scheduled for further development.

The museum building was constructed from the conversion of the 57m tall historic Grain Silo, originally built in 1921 and decommissioned in 2001. The architects, <a href="Thomas%20Heatherwick">Heatherwick Studio</a>, aimed to conserve and celebrate the original structure's industrial heritage, while simultaneously excavating large open spaces from the 42 densely-packed concrete cylinders from which it is was comprised. Using a variety of concrete-cutting techniques the interior of the building has been carved-out to create a number of galleries and a large central atrium. The remaining concrete shafts have been capped with strengthened glass in order to allow natural light to enter and create a "cathedral-like" interior. From the exterior, the most noticeable change to the original structure will be the addition of pillowed glass glazing panels into the building's upper floors.

Overall the the 9,500sqm complex consists of nine floors with 6,000sqm of dedicated exhibition space. Additionally there are 18 educational areas included on one floor, a sculpture garden on the lower part of the roof, as well as restaurants and a shop . The higher part of the building operates as The Silo Hotel, which opened its doors in March 2017.

HMS Ruby Prize (1694)

"Ruby Prize" was the French privateer "Entreprenante", commissioned in 1693 at Brest, that captured in 1694 and that the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> named "Ruby Prize" (or "Ruby's Prize"), and sold in 1698. Her new owners renamed her "Ruby" and she left <a href="the%20Downs">the Downs</a> in 1699 on a voyage to Persia for the EIC. She was lost with all hands later that year at <a href="Mayotte">Mayota</a>.

Naval career.
In 1693 French private parties acquired "Entreprenante" at Brest and commissioned her as a privateer of 44 guns.

HMS "Ruby" captured "Entreprenante" on 7 April 1694.

The Royal Navy purchased "Entreprenante" on 27 March 1695 and commissioned her as the <a href="fifth-rate">fifth-rate</a> "Ruby Prize" on 15 April 1695 under the command of Captain Thomas Elkins. 

"Ruby Prize" was among the vessels that sailed with Admiral <a href="Edward%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Orford">Russell</a> on 27 February 1696 from <a href="the%20Downs">the Downs</a>. The next day she was with him on the coast of France. At the time she had 156 men aboard. She was next mentioned in an order of 2 March 1696 that ordered the named vessels to sail to the <a href="Nore">Nore</a> and there to turn over their crews to man the "great ships' fitting out there.

In 1696 "Ruby Prize" was listed as a storeship at the <a href="Nore">Nore</a>. In 1696 Captain Samuel Vincent replaced Elkins, and within the year Captain John Herne replaced Vincent.
The Royal Navy sold "Ruby Prize" on 24 May 1698 for £501. Apparently it required an Act of Parliament to authorize her to have the "Freedom of trading as an English-built ship".

Merchantman.
Richard Wells, <a href="Rotherhithe">Rotherhithe</a>, purchased "Ruby Prize" and dropped the "Prize" from her name.

Captain John Barber sailed "Ruby" from <a href="the%20Downs">the Downs</a> on 28 April 1699, bound for Persia on a voyage for the EIC. "Ruby" foundered at Mayotte in 1699, with the loss of all hands.

Chan Chung Wing

Chan Chung Wing, also known as C.C. Wing, was the first <a href="Chinese%20American">Chinese American</a> lawyer in California (State Bar Number 2326). Wing was born in 1890 as the son of Chinese merchants in a Canton village. He graduated from the University of St. Ignatius College of Law (now known as the <a href="University%20of%20San%20Francisco%20School%20of%20Law">University of San Francisco School of Law</a>) in 1918 and started working as a lawyer in the San Francisco community.

Wing specialized in immigration law, working with hundreds of Chinese immigrants who sought to make a new life in the United States. Chinese immigrants who came to San Francisco were detained at <a href="Angel%20Island%20Immigration%20Station">Angel Island</a> for as much as two years, while immigration officials determined their eligibility for entry. Wing also brought more than 30 lawsuits against the San Francisco Police Department for the harassment of the Chinese. Because the <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act%20of%201882">Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882</a> was in effect, anti-Chinese sentiment was widespread. 

During the 1930s, Wing served as the first Chinese American head counsel for the Chinese branch of the foreign exchange department of the Bank of Italy. In the 1940s, Wing opened one of the first life insurance agencies in Chinatown. Throughout his professional life, Wing was an active member of the <a href="https%3A//www.usfca.edu/law/alumni">University of San Francisco Alumni Association,</a> and he inaugurated the C.C. Wing Classic Golf Tournament.

Wing died in 1983, but not before he saw one of his five children, Linda Chan, graduate from the University of San Francisco School of Law. 

Although other sources cite You Chung Hong as the first Chinese American lawyer in California, he did not pass the bar until 1923 (State Bar Number 4788).

Maas-Hoffman model

The Maas-Hoffman model is a mathematical tool to characterize the relation between crop production and <a href="soil%20salinity">soil salinity</a>. It describes the crop response by a broken line of which the first part is horizontal and the second is sloping downward. The "breakpoint" (Pb) or "threshold" is also called "tolerance" because up to that point the yield is unaffected by the salinity, so the salt is tolerated, while at greater salinity values the crops are affected negatively and the yield goes down.

Matehematically the two lines are represented by the equations:

Y = C                [X<Pb]<br>
Y = A.X + B       [X>Pb]

where Y = crop production or yield, C = maximum yield, X = soil salinity, A = slope (regression coefficient) of the descending line, and B = regression constant of that line.

In the example of the figure: C = 1.2, A = —0.10, Pb = 7.0

The value of Pb is to be found by <a href="regression%20analysis">regression analysis</a> and <a href="optimization">optimization</a> so that the <a href="goodness%20of%20fit">goodness of fit</a> of the data to the model is maximium.

Dr. Rashid Shaz

Rashid Shaz (; ) is an <a href="India">Indian</a> <a href="Islamic%20scholar">Islamic scholar</a>, Writer, Activist and Professor of english at AMU Aligarh. Prominent among his written works, Idrak e zawal e ummat, "lastam pokh", "kitabul urooj", "Muttahida islam ka Manshoor"

Brief Introduction.
H.E. Dr Rashid Shaz is an ISESCO Ambassador for Dialogue of Culture among Civilizations and a professor of English at the Aligarh Muslim University, India. Widely known as pioneer of the ‘New Dialogue’, Rashid Shaz has produced some ground breaking works on Islam from an interfaith point of view. His bookserves as an interfaith introduction to Islam in which he emphasises that the rabbania is the sum total of Islam, an ideological identity that embraces all the submitters to one God, especially the sublime souls among the people of the book. It was in this backdrop that in 2008 he released in Monaco an important founding document “Calling for a New Dialogue between Islam and Christianity”. Dr. Shaz has also revived and taken up further the long frozen debate on shibh-ahle-kitab. In his magnum opus ادراک اسباب تراجع الامۃ(۲ مجلد) he takes up the issue from the point where Al-Baironi and Shahrastani had left. In 2004, he motivated many enlightened intellectuals in Abrahamic traditions to debate the common issues on futureislam.com.

Appreciation and Activism.
He has been in the public arena for almost two decades. In 1992 while Oslo Peace Accord was in the air, he went on a peace mission to London and Washington DC to convey to the policy makers in these capitals about the Muslim sentiments on Jerusalem. In 1994 Dr. Shaz launched from New Delhi a weekly newspaper Milli Times International that ceased publishing in the year 2001. The year 2004 witnessed the birth of yet another journal FutureIslam.com , this time an electronic one and in four major languages; English, Urdu, Arabic and Indonesian. In 2005, under the aegis of futureislam.com he organized a major event in London on “Muslim Ummah: What Shall We do Now?”. Some of his books have been ground breaking and pioneered a new thinking as the Islamabad based journal of Ijtihad has projected him among a few living voices of modern ilm al-kalam and some scholars at the Imam university have projected him as pioneer of a neo-rationalist school in Islam. He rejects both the nomenclatures, though. FutureIslam.com, the journal that he edits and which is being revived after the suspension of three years, is regarded today as one of the most respectable forums of civilizational dialogues and Reform Islam as acknowledged by Amirpur & Amman in their German book Der Islam am Wendepunkt: Liberale und konservative Reformer einer Weltreligion, 2006, Verlag Herder, Germany. Recently, Robert Reilly, an American thinker, has written a whole new book The Closing of the Muslim Mind to support his contention. He writes: “in ‘Reinventing the Muslim Mind’, a contemporary Indian leader of reformist thought, Rashid Shaz states: "those eager to make a new beginning must accept beforehand that the traditional mind will lead them to nowhere…This book, then, is an effort to understand the journey that Sunni Islam took to nowhere.’’

It was released on August 10, 2017 via <a href="Warp%20Records">Warp Records</a>.

The soundtrack received positive reviews from critics, and won the Soundtrack Award at the 2017 <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. It includes a collaboration with singer <a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a>.

Background.
Lopatin had previously contributed scoring work to <a href="Sofia%20Coppola">Sofia Coppola</a>'s 2013 film "<a href="The%20Bling%20Ring">The Bling Ring</a>" (in collaboration with <a href="Brian%20Reitzell">Brian Reitzell</a>) and <a href="Ariel%20Kleiman">Ariel Kleiman</a>'s 2015 film "<a href="Partisan%20%28film%29">Partisan</a>". He became interested in working with the <a href="Safdie%20brothers">Safdie brothers</a> when they sent him a <a href="mood%20board">mood board</a> that featured images from "completely unrelated stuff, like a picture of <a href="SpongeBob%20SquarePants%20%28character%29">SpongeBob</a> and then weird <a href="heist%20film">heist imagery</a>." The Safdie brothers were previously fans of the Oneohtrix Point Never track "Behind the Bank." Josh Safdie explained that "I had always imagined Dan’s work, especially his earlier work, as soundtracks to movies that never existed." 

During recording, the brothers invoked the work German electronic group <a href="Tangerine%20Dream">Tangerine Dream</a> but also encouraged Lopatin to experiment and make the music "more fucked up," including influences from <a href="prog%20rock">prog rock</a>, which helped him to avoid "mimetically revert[ing] to <a href="Edgar%20Froese">Edgar Froese</a>—it's just in my DNA." He reached out to <a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a> to record for the movie's ending after his manager told him to "think big." Lopatin also described the recording as an update of his earlier <a href="analog%20synthesizer">synthesizer</a>-based work, stating that "I wanted to make something that sounded like "Good Time" back when I was doing the early stuff, but I didn’t quite know how yet." The Sadie brothers characterized it as if "OPN took everything he learned on ""<a href="R%20Plus%20Seven">R Plus Seven</a>", "<a href="Replica%20%28Oneohtrix%20Point%20Never%20album%29">Replica</a>", "<a href="Garden%20of%20Delete">Garden of Delete</a>" and did a sequel to "<a href="Rifts%20%28Oneohtrix%20Point%20Never%20album%29">Rifts</a>.""

Critical reception.
Following the film's premier at <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>, Lopatin's score won the festival's Soundtrack Award. It was later released as an album via <a href="Warp%20Records">Warp Records</a>. The album has received generally positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 79 out of 100 at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. 

Ashley Hampson of "<a href="Exclaim%21">Exclaim!</a>" wrote that "there's no doubt "Good Time" OST absolutely sounds like a movie score, but every single track here stands on its own, providing an intensely emotional punch to the gut." Sean O'Neal of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" called it "a masterful job of homage, and—as with "<a href="Thief%20%28film%29">Thief</a>" and "<a href="Drive%20%282011%20film%29">Drive</a>" before it—all those pulsating synths and cavernous low tones give the film much of its swagger." "<a href="Q%20Magazine">Q</a>" stated that "its tight-wound <a href="electronica">electronica</a> is perfect for anyone wanting a visual-free sensation of mounting suspense in the comfort of their own home." Ben Beaumont-Thomas of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" noted the inspiration of composers such as <a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>, <a href="Brad%20Fiedel">Brad Fiedel</a>, and <a href="Vangelis">Vangelis</a> but stated that "the sheer density and erratic energy is all Lopatin’s own." He described Iggy Pop's guest appearance as one of the singer's "great late-period triumphs."

Hedi (Policy)

Hedi was an economic policy of the imperial China. It was the state purchase of food supplies from farmers. As a means to control the price of grains and foods, it is an early example <a href="Government%20procurement">Government procurement</a>.

The policy was adopted in the year of <a href="488">488</a> by <a href="Emperor%20Xiaowen%20of%20Northern%20Wei">Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei</a> as a counter measure of <a href="drought">drought</a>. The state purchases food supplies and stock them. When drought attacks, the stocked foods were sold in order to prevent <a href="famine">famine</a>. Later, the purchased foods were also used as rations for the frontier force of <a href="Northern%20Wei%20dynasty">Northern Wei dynasty</a>. 

The policy had always kept the price of state purchased foods higher than the market price of these foods. However, during the reign of <a href="Emperor%20Dezong%20of%20Tang">Emperor Dezong of Tang</a>, the imperial court purchased foods with a price that was lower than the market price. Chancellor <a href="Lu%20Zhi%20%28Tang%20dynasty%29">Lu Zhi</a> critically pointed out that, when purchasing food with such low price, the government was turning the policy of Hedi into a type of tax which aggravated the burden of tax payers(since they had to "sell" their harvests with a price that would never benefit them).

During the <a href="Song-Yuan%20wars">Mongol invasion of Song dynasty</a>, Song army had to constantly engage the Mongols. The cost of war was extremely high and the imperial court began to forcefully purchase food supplies from farmers. The official price by then was considerably lower than the market price. Government officials also acknowledged the fact that the policy had become pure robbery. Since the forced purchase of harvests did not compensate sellers, the policy discouraged the development of agriculture. Between 1159 and 1259, the anual amount of forced purchase of food supplies from farmers had increased from 2,300,000 <a href="Picul">Picul</a> to 5,600,000 picul. In Yuan dynasty, most of the cases of Hedi were not voluntary. The policy of Hedi continued to exist in <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming</a> and <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing</a> dynasty until the fall of the last dynasty in 1911. 

The abuse of Hedi did not originate from the late Song dynasty. Recorded abuse of Hedi date back as early as the year of <a href="787">787</a>. In <a href="1114">1114</a> and <a href="1126">1126</a> two different cases of abuse were reported. Local government officials reportedly lowered the price of purchase or collected additional tax without any authorization. 

Despite of the later abuses, Hedi did provide farmers benefits. The policy was especially effective in a surplus of food supplies which causes the price of grains to drop. With the state purchase of excessive food supplies, farmers do not need to sell them in a low price in years of surplus

Death of Emelie Meng

Emelie Meng was an 17-year old Danish girl living in Denmark. The killing and disappearance of Emilie Meng was a crime that took place in 2016. The case got media attention and an investigation of both police and civilians. Emilie Meng was placed on the poster with the enlightenment of the whole country.

Emilie Anine Skovgaard Meng (born Korsør July 31, 1998, died on July 10, 2016 or shortly after the age of 17 years and 11 months) disappeared on 10 July 2016 in Korsør after a city trip in Slagelse with his girlfriends. They arrived around kl. 4 in the morning at Korsør station and Emilie went home alone on foot.

Many volunteers helped the police to look for Emilie Meng. There were several inquiries to the police that led to three suspects, including a 33-year-old truck driver and a 67-year-old, who got his house run five times, but later turned out they had nothing to do with the case. After four months the police worked with 3 theories:

She has chosen to live somewhere else for a while
She has been exposed to an accident in one form or another
She has been exposed to a crime
Found dead, investigated as a crime.
Emilie Meng was found dead at Regnemarks Bakker, Køge Municipality near Borup on December 24, 2016. The police seized and investigated the site. The police announced at a press conference the following evening that Emilie Meng had been exposed to a very serious crime. The police investigate evidence and mobile traffic from the area where Emilie Meng disappeared and where she was found.

On Monday, December 26, 2016, a memorial ceremony was held at Korsør Station, where several hundred people were present, among them the mayor of Slagelse Municipality, Sten Knuth (V).

Brenda Walsh (character)

Brenda Walsh, portrayed by <a href="Shannon%20Doherty">Shannon Doherty</a>, is a fictional <a href="Character%20%28arts%29">character</a> who was the female lead of "<a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%2090210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a>" for the majority of the show's duration.

Conception.
Brenda and her brother, <a href="Brandon%20Walsh">Brandon Walsh</a>, were living in Minnesota until their father, Jim Walsh, was promoted and forced to travel to Beverly Hills in 1990. The series initially focused on their stories with A new cultural life shock and their relationship with their new friends in Beverly Hills, Kelly Taylor, Dylan McKay, Donna Martin, Andrea Zuckerman, David Silver and Steve Sanders.

Season 1.
The key development of his character came during a series of episodes involving a forbidden story with Brandon's solitary friend, Dylan McKay, who had long had the attention of Brenda's best friend, Kelly. Brenda and Dylan went out together for two years and their relationship quickly became serious. After a frantic dispute with her father, Dylan was consoled and shared a passionate kiss with Brenda. This scene has become one of the most mythical of the series. However, Brenda's father was immediately against this relationship, due to the bad reputation of Dylan's father.

After two months of relationship, Dylan wanted to have sex, but Brenda was not ready. During a trip to Palm Springs, Brenda went to meet Dylan in a hotel room, but sees him with another girl and jumped to the conclusion that they had made love. Brenda and Dylan argued but quickly reconciled. As a result, Dylan agreed to wait until Brenda was ready. It is during the year-end ball that Brenda will lose her virginity. Soon after, Brenda became worried about being pregnant. It turned out that it was a false alarm, but Brenda separated from Dylan by saying that she was not ready for regular sexual intercourse.

Season 2.
Despite the breakup, Brenda was hurt by seeing Dylan go out with other girls. Brenda's feelings for Dylan eventually led the couple back together. Their relationship grew stronger when Brenda met Dylan's mother, Iris, with whom she tied up.

The couple faced another hurdle when Brenda wanted to publish an article about the alarm of her pregnancy but Dylan objected, arguing that it was very personal. Typical of their relationship, Brenda and Dylan were once again reconciled after another dispute. In addition, Brenda was the victim of an armed robbery at the Peach Pit. This scene shocked her a lot and led her to see a psychologist, Dylan helped her a lot when she began to have nightmares about this event. Things get more serious when Brenda spends a lot of time with Dylan without worrying about the limitations imposed by her parents. The latter invited her to a trip to Mexico and Brenda agrees, despite the formal prohibition of her father. The trip will be punctuated by a dispute and a passage at the customs where Brenda will realize that she does not have her passport and is therefore forced to phone her parents. When Brenda's parents are aware of her trip to Mexico with Dylan, the girl's father formally banned her from seeing him again. But she refuses to break and hides her relationship with Dylan.

Season 3.
Early in the summer, Jim, who had recognized the futility of his quarrel with Dylan, offered another option: let Brenda go to Paris for a French immersion program in place of Kelly (who had dropped out of the program for Helping her mother with her younger sister) giving Jim, Brenda & Dylan, a necessary setback to the situation. In Paris, Brenda pretends to be a French guide with a cute young man from Wisconsin, Rick. However, a rapprochement is made between Kelly & Dylan on the other side of the ocean. Rick and Brenda come out briefly together after seeing each other in a video store. They split up after Brenda realized that he had more in common with her father than with her.
The love triangle that followed Brenda's return quickly became a milestone in the series that helped increase her popularity and gave rise to the rumors of rivalry announced between Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth. The final confrontation between Brenda, Dylan and Kelly - in which he informs Brenda that he has chosen his best friend - was listed by Entertainment Weekly as one of the greatest moments of television.

Season 4.
Brenda, still distressed by the fact that Dylan chose Kelly, began the fourth season in Minnesota, where she had decided to enter university. However, hearing about the break between Dylan and Kelly and realizing that she and her old friends from Minnesota have little in common, she decides to return to Beverly Hills and continue her studies at University of California. After her return, she met a rich young man named Stuart (whom Dylan knew of as a drug dealer in the past), and soon fell in love with him. The couple get engaged even in the first few weeks of their encounter and choose Las Vegas, forcing Dylan and his friends to come and try to stop them. They succeed by using reverse psychology, pretending that they are in favor of a marriage between the two young people. Brenda's life also took a few shots during the season. When Donna and Brenda find a puppy on the street, they learn that he escaped from an animal testing laboratory and are helpless when the puppy dies. Brenda then falls into a group of animal rights activists and participates with them in the ransacking of a number of laboratories until she is arrested (Donna decides at the last minute not to join the group). After his arrest, the only person in the group who supported him was Dylan; David Silver questioned her judgment, Andrea was angry that she had damaged laboratories that did not test animals and Kelly told her that Dylan was no longer her boyfriend and that Brenda could not go and look for help whenever she had a problem. It turned out that one of the activists was an FBI agent who offered Brenda a deal not to jail because she had not supported vandalism.

As a result, all Brenda's friends apologized for their behavior towards her. During the fourth season, Brenda is interested in the comedy but it also led to problems: she spoiled her first audition and then went to the director of the play to try again and convince him. She then got the role, but a student made a rumor saying that she had slept to have the role. Unfortunately, this student is the girlfriend of Steve Sanders and the latter believed the rumors, others refusing more or less to believe the denials of Brenda. Steve understood his mistake when the student asked him to attack Brenda to make him miss rehearsals. A little later, Steve's friend tried to commit suicide, but Brenda and Steve joined forces to save her and Steve was finally compensated by following Brenda's debut on stage. The director's praise led her to accept the latter at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in London for a year. After Kelly and Dylan last broke, Brenda finally learned that a story was possible between Kelly and Brandon and expressed her blessing. She later spent her last night with Dylan, telling her she would not be gone forever. The couple will reconcile briefly in the final scene of the fourth season, though (because of Shannen Doherty's departure) Brenda's character was removed from the script and she never returned to Beverly Hills.

Conflicts with Beverly Hills 90210.
Shannon Doherty was notorious for being late and being in conflict with staff. <a href="Tiffani-Amber%20Thiessen">Tiffani-Amber Thiessen</a> replaced Brenda Walsh as a character called <a href="Valerie%20Malone">Valerie Malone</a>.

After the departure.
Despite the fact that Brenda never appeared on the screen, she was nonetheless present during occasional discussions during the following six seasons of the series. The most significant among them is his reconciliation with Dylan, who was going to move in with her. It is assumed that they were together for most episodes of the seventh and eighth seasons of the series, as during an episode of season 8 where it is learned that Dylan's half-sister was saved from A life of prostitution and then left to live with Dylan and Brenda in London and Kelly and Brandon mentioned going to visit them for part of their honeymoon. Later, when Dylan returned in season 9, he told his friends that he and Brenda had separated two years earlier. However, it frees Dylan to resume his relationship with Kelly.

In Season 5, Dylan rages against Valerie, the Walsh cousin, blaming her for wanting to imitate Brenda and not having the guts to confront the Walsh parents, as Brenda was able to do before. She will also send an announcement to Dylan at the latter's wedding. Or, in the last episode of the series illustrating the marriage of Donna and David, it is alluded to a party that Brenda had organized when they were still in high school.

(90210).
14 years after her departure, Brenda is back in Beverly Hills. On the advice of Kelly to the new principal, Brenda, become actress, is led to direct the musical of the high school. She will have to deal with the drug problems of the high school girl who plays the lead role in the show and will help her get out of it, which will follow a mutual attachment of the latter. She will also spend a lot of time with Kelly although at times, they will recover some tensions due among others to Dylan. Kelly also learns later that Brenda has slept with Ryan, the high school English teacher, while Kelly has a lot of affection for him. But they will always be reconciled. We also learn that Brenda can not have children, who can count on the support of her friend Kelly. She will go to China and adopt a little girl.

Reception.
The character had a mixed reception from fans and critics as some view the character as a <a href="bitch">bitch</a>.

<doc id="54867378" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54867378" title="Coinage Act of 1853">
Coinage Act of 1853

The Coinage Act of 1853, <a href="http%3A//memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage%3FcollId%3Dllsl%26amp%3BfileName%3D010/llsl010.db%26amp%3BrecNum%3D181">10 Stat. 160</a>, was a piece of legislation passed by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> which lowered the silver content of the silver half dime, dime, quarter dollar, and half dollar. Although intending to stabilize the country's silver shortage, it, in effect, pushed the United States closer to abandoning <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a> entirely and adopting the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>.

Smaller silver denominations in the United States were disappearing as the bullion value of silver far exceeded the face value of U.S. silver coinage. In response, Congress debated a bill which would overvalue most forms of silver coinage and authorize the <a href="U.S.%20Mint">U.S. Mint</a> to purchase bullion for the new coins. The legislation lowered the silver content of most silver coins by seven percent and was signed into law on February 21, 1853. 

The 1853 act increased the circulation of small coinage, ending the United States' silver shortage crisis, and provided an adequate supply of <a href="United_States_Seated_Liberty_coinage">silver coinage</a> for the first time in the nation's history. However, by the time of the outbreak of the <a href="United%20States%20civil%20war">Civil War</a>, most metallic coinage became hoarded and the country largely switched to <a href="Greenback">Greenbacks</a>. It would be in <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">1873</a> when the debate between silver and gold was finally resolved, with all pretenses of bimetallism replaced in favor of the gold standard. 

Background.
Since 1792, both silver and gold were <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> in the United States and citizens could deposit either of the metals in <a href="bullion">bullion</a> form to the <a href="U.S.%20Mint">U.S. Mint</a>, which would then give the depositor gold or silver coins based on a legally defined weight ratio of gold and silver, respectively, to dollars. This <a href="bimetallism">bimetallic</a> standard was prone to instability, as the value of gold and silver bullion could float on the world market, making U.S. gold and silver coins either over-valued or under-valued depending on the circumstances. This resulted in most U.S. gold and silver being exported to be sold as bullion and most coinage circulated in the country was foreign in origin. 

<a href="President%20Jackson">President Jackson</a> intended to increase the circulation of both gold and silver by slightly overvaluing gold in 1834, matching 16 ounces of silver in value to an ounce of gold. The <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201834">1834 Coinage Act</a> was initially successful, as the Mint ratio of 16:1 remained fortuitously close to the world price ratio of gold to silver, limiting the advantage speculators would get from melting down silver coinage and selling it as bullion overseas while incentivizing depositors to turn their gold bullion into coins. The United States experienced a net in-flow of gold and silver throughout the early 1840s, and small silver coinage became the major medium of exchange in smaller business transactions.

Coin shortage.
However, by 1847, the world ratio of silver ounces to gold had declined to 15.66:1, setting on a collision course with the Mint's legal ratio. In 1849, this ratio was worsened dramatically with the onset of the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> and the discovery of <a href="Australian_gold_rushes%23February_1851">new gold deposits in Australia</a> in 1851. These new gold discoveries more than quadrupled annual gold production from an average of 36 million dollars in the 1840s to 155 million dollars by 1853.

As gold flooded the monetary markets of the world, its commodity price declined due to its higher supply. This, in turn, caused the price of silver relative to gold to skyrocket. American silver became a premium. With the bullion value of silver far exceeding the <a href="face%20value">face value</a> of U.S. silver coins, melting became rampant as speculators could sell off their silver coins as bullion for its more profitable world market value. Small silver coinage, which retail businesses and consumers relied upon for minor transactions, soon began to disappear, forcing some businesses to pay premium values just to obtain change.

Inception.
Throughout the early 1850s, Congress debated numerous proposals which would <a href="debase">debase</a> silver coinage to overvalue silver and stem the out-flow of the metal from the United States. But there was significant resistance among some congressmen to any attempt to tamper with the value of money, despite the fact that Congress in 1834 had already established a precedent by effectively debasing gold coinage to improve its circulation.
Intentions of the bill's authors.
By December 1851, the Treasury Department submitted a report which indicated that the disappearance of U.S. currency had reached a critical point, and put forth recommendations to reduce the silver content in all forms of silver coinage. Following the recommendations of the Treasury, a bill passed through the <a href="Senate%20Finance%20Committee">Senate Finance Committee</a> in March 1852 which would reduce nearly all U.S. fractions by around 7 percent, but--contrary to the Treasury's report--left the silver dollar unchanged. This was to make explicit, in the words of the Committee chair <a href="Robert%20M.%20T.%20Hunter">Robert M. T. Hunter</a>, that the Committee had apprehension towards tampering with what they viewed as money's inherent value, and only intended the bill to be a temporary measure to restore some circulation of silver to the country. The bill would not be a drastic change, but would only mandate the smallest deviation possible necessary to "accomplish the object of retaining a specie currency for small transactions". Still contending with the objections of some senators, Senate Bill No. 271 passed the Senate and moved to consideration in the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> in December 1852.

Passage through the House.
Senate No. 271 ran into numerous obstacles in the House. Then Tennessee representative and future president <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> was one of many vociferous opponents of the proposal to debase silver, calling the idea of Congress fixing the value of currency an exercise in the "merest quackery--the veriest charlatanism". Additionally, the bill was encumbered by numerous House amendments led by a cadre of congressmen who wished to see the United States switch entirely to the gold standard. The most important amendment, authored by Representative <a href="Cyrus%20L.%20Dunham">Cyrus Dunham</a>, would have removed <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> status from any new silver coins in private transactions, so as to eliminate silver as a medium of exchange. Dunham's amended version of the bill ran into heavy opposition, however, both from proponents of bimetallism that wanted to see the Senate No. 271 pass unaltered and those congressmen fiercely opposed to any change to the status quo. Finally, on February 15, 1853, the bill was passed through the House in exactly the same form that it left the Senate months earlier, and was signed into law six days later. 

Provisions.
The Coinage Act of February 21, 1853 lowered the weight (i.e. the silver content) of all silver coinage except for the silver dollar by approximately 7 percent. The Act also fixed the legal tender status of silver to transactions worth a maximum of five dollars. It also authorized the <a href="U.S.%20Mint">U.S. Mint</a> to purchase silver bullion using the Mint's bullion fund to create the new coins, and only sell the silver coins to the public in exchange for gold. Finally, the Act forbade private depositors from having their bullion struck into half dime, dime, quarter dollar, and half dollar denominations. 

In essence, the Act turned silver into a <a href="Fiat%20money">fiduciary currency</a>, transforming the value of silver coins from something goods and services were sold "for" into a medium "by which" goods and services were exchanged. 

The silver dollar, which was left untouched by the alteration, has been theorized as the Senate Finance Committee's way of signaling that Congress still held to a de jure bimetallic standard even as the Act eroded against traditional conceptions of silver as a currency.

Design of new coins.
Mint officials decided that the new, lower-weight coins should have distinct markings to distinguish them from earlier, full-weight coins. But the necessity of minting as many of the new coins as quickly as possible, to meet the demand of the silver coin shortage, led officials to decide upon simply stamping arrows on either side of the date on the coin and adding a halo of rays on the reverse side of the quarter and half-dollar. Even this caused issues, as the rays complicated and slowed down <a href="Coining%20%28mint%29">die production</a> to an unacceptable degree. The rays were removed from the quarter and half-dollar before the end of 1853, although the arrows were kept on new denominations for several more years.

Aftermath.
Controversy arose due to Mint officials' maladministration of the law. The Act only allowed the Mint to purchase silver bullion from the Mint's bullion fund to create the new coins. However, Mint Director <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a> purchased silver bullion from private owners using the new, under-weight silver coins. Even when the market price of silver bullion had fallen, Snowden continued this practice and effectively allowed for free coinage of silver coins as the Act had neglected to set a ceiling limit on the amount of bullion the Mint could purchase. As the silver coins had a legal tender limit of $5, a glut arose of the lightweight silver coins on the market in the late 1850s. Treasury Secretary <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28Kentucky%29">James Guthrie</a> briefly suspended the coinage of quarters and half dollars as a result of the surplus, but never investigated the Mint policy responsible for creating the oversupply. The nation's silver redundancy lasted until 1862, when the pinch of the Civil War caused coins to disappear from circulation. 

Ultimately, the Act achieved what it set out to do and cured the nation's silver shortage. By reducing silver, small coinage reached a level where it could once again circulate in private transactions. The net outflow of silver slowed as the new coins were no longer worth their weight in silver, and were worth more for their face value within the United States than as bullion abroad. 

The Act was the beginning of an economic debate between gold and silver which last until the late 19th century, but the fundamental discussion about the role of fiduciary currency would only truly be resolved in 1970 when the U.S. dollar was removed from its peg to the gold standard.

Société Mokta El Hadid

The Société Mokta El Hadid was an iron ore mining company in Algeria, and later in other West African countries.
From around 1865 until 1927 it was the largest mining company in Algeria, delivering ore of exceptional quality for processing in France.
In 1878 the original Mokta El Hadid mine near Bône (now <a href="Annaba">Annaba</a>) was said to be capable of supporting 25% of Europe's steel production.
Before this mine was exhausted the company opened additional mines in Algeria.
Later it extended its operations to countries such as Tunisia, Morocco, Niger, Côte-d'Ivoire and Madagascar, and mined manganese, chromium and uranium.
In October 1970 the Société le Nickel, soon to become the <a href="Im%C3%A9tal">Imétal</a> holding company, took over the Mokta company.
The company was later renamed Compagnie française de Mokta (CFM), specializing in uranium mining.

First discovery.
The mine is about from the port of <a href="B%C3%B4ne">Bône</a> in the Mokta hill beside at the foot of a mountain chain that runs from south to north, then turns east to Bône.
The name "Mokta-el-Hadid" (the iron pass) indicates that the presence of iron has long been known, but there is no sign that it was worked before the first small-scale attempts in 1840.
The geologist Henri Fournel discovered the deposits of <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a> in 1843.

The businessman <a href="Paulin%20Talabot">Paulin Talabot</a> had a "Mediterranean dream" involving "the exploitation of the mines of the Bône region, which would feed his coal mines in <a href="La%20Grand-Combe">the Grand-Combe</a> by means of rapid transport in his ships of the <a href="Compagnie%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20Transatlantique">Compagnie Générale Transatlantique</a>, relayed by his Algerian railroad cars and those of the <a href="Chemins%20de%20fer%20de%20Paris%20%C3%A0%20Lyon%20et%20%C3%A0%20la%20M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e">PLM</a>."
Before Fournel's survey was complete, in 1845 the Talabots or their associates had obtained three of the four concessions in the Bône region.
Algeria in the 19th century did not have coking coal, so did not process its iron ore.
Instead, the ore was shipped to the coast and sold to a shipper, who in turn sold it to European steel mills for about twice the price.
Talabot thought of building an ironworks at Bône, but abandoned the idea in 1848 part due to the danger of attack by the Algerians and in part to a threatened boycott of Algerian iron ore by the Schneiders of <a href="Le%20Creusot">Le Creusot</a>.

A report by Fournel to the Académie des sciences on 14 May 1848 said, "to the north of Lake F'Zara there is a whole mountain, the Mokta-el-Hadid (the quarry of iron) which emerges from the gneisses and literally presents from foot to top, that is to say over a height of more than one hundred meters, a mass of pure oxidized iron, with no admixture of rock. To the east of this deposit, which few deposits known elsewhere could parallel, the oxidized iron pierces several other points."
Talabot asked the geologist Émilien Dumas to assess the deposit.
He contacted the polytechnician and engineer of mines Alphonse Parran to form the new company and start exploitation.

Due to shortage of both labour and capital, little progress was made and in 1849 the government revoked the three Talabot concessions.
In 1852 they were restored after <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> had taken power.
In 1857 the Mokta el Hadid mine was found, and the Talabots gained the concession.
The ore was in a vein long and wide.
The magnetite ore was 70% pure iron.
This ore, free of sulfur and phosphorus, was much more suitable for the <a href="Bessemer%20process">Bessemer</a> and <a href="Martin%20process">Martin</a> processes than the poorer ores high in phosphorus that are typical of France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany.

Plans for a merger with the steelworks at <a href="Alais">Alais</a> in the <a href="Gard">Gard</a> were drawn up, possibly part of a larger merger with the mines of the Grand-Combe, but stalled.
In 1863 the Société de Mokta el Hadid was established definitively.
Plans were drawn up to combine the Mokta el Hadid mines with the <a href="Firminy">Firminy</a>, Loire, steelworks, the <a href="Gard">Gard</a> coal mines and the Saut-du-Tarn steelworks near <a href="Albi">Albi</a>, Tarn.
20 million francs of capital would be needed, including 8 million of fresh capital for upgrades at the various sites.
These plans also dragged out.

Mokta el Hadid mine.
Extensive construction was undertaken at Bône in 1856–69 to build an sheltered port facility to handle the ore from Mokta el Hadid.
A short railway line was built from the mine at Ain Mokra to the Bône docks.
The line was opened in 1864, the first railway line in Algeria.
Full-scale production began in 1865.
Before the mine was opened Bône had 10,000 inhabitants. 
By 1924 there were 41,000 and the port was being used to export phosphates, lead and zinc ore.
The arrival in large volumes of Algerian ores from Mokta-el-Hadid upset the supply chain in France.
The success at the Firminy plant in making steel rails using only ore from the Algerian mines was a major argument for installation of furnaces based on the <a href="Martin%20process">Martin process</a> at <a href="Le%20Creusot">Le Creusot</a>.
In 1865 <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Schneider">Eugène Schneider</a> had reached an agreement with Paulin Talabot to obtain a large supply of Algerian ore, making it possible to start intensive steel production.
In 1865 Napoleon III visited Algeria, including a trip to the mine and the city of Bône.
A photograph survives of the emperor and his entourage taking refreshment under a tent at the mine site.
Paulin Talabot founded the Société General Algérienne (SGA) in 1865 to promote economic growth in the colony of Algeria, which created five villages for French colonists.
It was granted of land in exchange for a 100 million franc loan to Napoleon III, which was spent on Algerian public works.
After experiencing some financial difficulties the SGA was reorganized as the Compagnie Algérienne in 1877.

In 1865 the mine produced 22,000 tons, rising to 255,000 tons in 1869.
The abundant ore was extracted from underground galleries and shipped from Bône to the main French steelworks.
In 1870 Algeria as a whole exported 84,710 tons of iron ore.
In the 1870s 2/3 of all miners in Algeria were working the Mokta-el-Hadid mine.
In 1874 the Mokta el Hadid mine alone shipped 430,000 tons of ore, containing 260,000 tons of iron.
At this time Britain was producing a total of 500,000 tons of steel.
The mine was said to be capable of supporting 25% of Europe's steel production.
In 1875–76 the Bou Djima River, which was carrying silt into the port, was diverted to the <a href="Seybouse%20River">Seybouse River</a>.
The railway could now be extended to the port, considerably reducing transport costs.

Alphonse Parran remained head of the company until 1900.
Philippe de Cerner took over management of the Mokta-el-Hadid mine in 1875.
Output from the 14 iron ore mines in Algeria rose to 511,000 tons in 1876, then started to decline.
In 1879 the country exported 400,000 tons, of which 320,000 tons came from Mokta-el-Hadid.
Very little of the ore was smelted before export.
The port of Bône shipped only 148,695 tons of ore in 1893.
After 1903 the company ceded its rights to the the Lake of Fetzara to the SGA colony, which took over the work and completed it in 1935.
Mining at Mokta el Hadid ended in 1904.

Lake of Fetzara.
The mine is beside the <a href="Lake%20of%20Fetzara">Lake of Fetzara</a>.
When it started operation the lake's surface elevation would have reached in winter, with an area of .
The lake was bordered with reeds and rushes, used for nesting by migratory birds, and was rich in fish.
The lake was considered a source of fever, and a drainage channel flowing into the <a href="Oued%20Meboudja">Oued Meboudja</a> was proposed, but although the SGA had rights to the northern and eastern shores of the lake it did nothing.

In the 1870s the company planted many eucalyptus trees around the Lake of Fetzara.
A report published in 1901 said, "The example of Lake Fetzara has been much quoted; its marshy miasma infected the large mining works of Mokta-el-Hadid, decimated the staff, and rendered existence in this locality insupportable. Now, thanks to well developed forests of Eucalyptus, it presents all the conditions of a tolerable hygiene." The report then noted that the improvement could also be attributed in part to better medical attention and the fact that most of the staff commuted to work from Bône. 
The trees were all killed by salt water seeping from the lake.
In 1877 the Mokta El Hadid company gained permission to drain the lake in exchange for free transfer of the reclaimed land.
A channel led from the center of the lake, crossed the western flank and led to the Meboudja.
The surface elevation had dropped to by 1880, but the lake remained swampy in summer.

Other operations.
As of 1878 the company had also opened the Korezza, Bou-Hamra and Marouaina mines.
Before the Mokta deposits started showing signs of running out Alphonse Parran obtained the deposit of Rar El Baroud near <a href="B%C3%A9ni%20Saf">Béni Saf</a> in 1879.
The ore in the Béni Saf region near Montagnac (now named <a href="Remchi">Remchi</a>) is <a href="hematite">hematite</a> with 2% manganese.
Between 1867 and 1947 the region produced 30 million metric tons of ore.
Alphonse Parran was also involved in the <a href="Kryvyi%20Rih">Kryvyi Rih</a> iron ore mine in Russia in 1881 and the <a href="Compagnie%20des%20phosphates%20de%20Gafsa">Gafsa phosphate deposits</a> in Tunisia in 1886.
In Tunisia as of 1893 the company owned concessions at Ras Radjid, Bou lanague, Dj Bellif and Ganara in the Kroumine between <a href="Tabarka">Tabarka</a> and <a href="Cap%20Serrat">Cap Serrat</a>.
The ores, which had not yet been worked, were brown and red hematites with an average of 50% iron.

By 1895 the company had bought all the iron ore beds in the Ouelhasses Cheragas ore district of Algeria apart from Boukourdan. 
These included the Das rih and Bar el Baroud beds of Béni Saf, and the Ten Kreut, Djed el Haouraia and Sidi-safi groups of ore beds.
Only the Bar el Baroud was being worked, using open-cut mining to extract ore with at least 55% iron.
The port of Béni Saf was operated privately by the company, which had built it and had a 99-year lease.
Estimated output was 291,547 metric tons in 1892 and 203,338 tons in 1893.
Destinations, in order, were England, the Netherlands, France, the US and Belgium.
The company obtained the <a href="Boukhadra">Boukhadra</a> deposits near the Tunisian border in 1902.

In the period from 1900 to 1930 the company was among the powerful capitalist groups in the French colonial empire that provided exceptional rates of profit.
Alphonse Parran was succeeded as head of the company in 1900 by Édouard de Billy (1866–1919).
Billy was replaced in 1918 by Charles-Émile Heurteau (1878–1961), who took the simple title of Director while Léon de Nervo (1873–1973), the heir of Paulin Talabot, took the title of Managing Director.
Léon de Nervo was also president of the Société Commerciale de Navigation, which operated three 6,800 ton cargo vessels that carried North African iron ore to European ports and to the US.
Heurteau left in the 1920s to take a position as Managing Director at the Marles coal mines.
André Duby joined as chief engineer of technical services in 1927, then became co-director with Léon de Nervo, and sole director in the 1940s.
From 1901 the company began using Moroccan workers in its Béni Saf mines.
In 1905 the small Mokta railway was connected to the departmental network, connecting the port of Bone to the Jemmapes (<a href="Azzaba%2C%20Algeria">Azzaba</a>) region, and now extended as far as Saint-Charles (<a href="Ramdane%20Djamel">Ramdane Djamel</a>).
Philippe de Cerner, the company manager in Bône, had convinced the government to extend the railway west from Ain Mokra to connect with the main line to Philippeville (<a href="Skikda">Skikda</a>), and then persuaded the government to assume responsibility for running the line in the public interest.
Philippe de Cerner was appointed director of the new line from 1908 until his retirement in 1917.
In 1912 the Compagnie des minérais de fer magnétique de Mokta-el-Hadid had a capital of 20 million and made a profit of 4.5 million.
When World War I began Mokta-el Hadid was one of only two privately owned French colonial companies other than banks and railways with capital of over 20 million francs, the other being the Société Le Nickel in New Caledonia.

In 1917 the Société Mokta El Hadid and the Société des Hauts Fourneaux de Rouen agreed to form a joint venture to exploit the Boukhadra deposits, which was supported by the minister <a href="Albert%20Thomas%20%28minister%29">Albert Thomas</a>.
However, the administration of governor <a href="Charles%20Lutaud">Charles Lutaud</a> submitted an alternative proposal to the government that required the company to build blast furnaces in Bône and to pay higher royalties to Algeria.
The agreement and specifications for this project were signed early in 1918, with 85% of the capital supplied by Mokta and Hauts Fourneaux de Rouen, and 15% by <a href="Denain-Anzin">Denain-Anzin</a> and a consortium of Algerian banks.
Two blast furnaces would be built with combined annual capacity of 80,000 tons.
However, after <a href="Charles%20Jonnart">Charles Jonnart</a> returned to Algeria as governor the project was delayed and eventually cancelled.

In May 1919 the company's miners went on strike in solidarity with strikers in other industries, but the strike quickly fizzled out.
Mokta el Hadid was the largest mining company in Algeria until 1927, when it was overtaken by the Societe de l'Ouenza.
The Mokta el Hadid iron ore mining company was responsible for creation of SACEM in 1929.
SACEM (Société anonyme chérifienne d'études minières), based in Casablanca, Morocco, was founded to exploit the Imini manganese mines.
The ratio of Société Mokta El Hadid share prices to earnings fluctuated from 3.0 in 1929 up to 11.0 in 1933, falling back to 1.8 by 1937.

Post-World War II.
After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> (1939–45) the Mokta El Hadid iron ore belonged to the <a href="Mirabaud%20Group">Mirabaud Group</a>.
As of 1950 the company was capitalized at 5.1 billion francs, one of the top 2 on the <a href="Paris%20Bourse">Paris Bourse</a>.
In 1951 the Société de l'Ouenza produced 60% of Algerian iron, 85% in Ouenza and 15% in Bou-Kadra.
Mokta-el-Hadid was the second iron ore mining company in Algeria, with many subsidiaries and several concessions, including in Morocco.
<a href="Henri%20Lafond">Henri Lafond</a> was head of the Banque de l'Union Parisienne from 1951, which controlled Mokta El Hadid, and was also head of SACEM.
Lafond headed the Mokta company until his death in 1963.
On 24 April 1953 a joint corporation was established to mine a deposit estimated at 50 million tons of manganese ore in Gabon owned by the Bureau of Mines of Overseas France (21%), Eastern Tjbangi Mining Company (15%), Mokta el Hadid group (15%) and the <a href="U.S.%20Steel">U.S. Steel</a> (49%).
A railway had first to be built to the coast, so full production was not expected until at least 1960.
The <a href="Compagnie%20mini%C3%A8re%20de%20l%27Ogoou%C3%A9">Compagnie minière de l'Ogooué</a> (Comilog) had initial capital of CFA 150 million.
The first ore was shipped from <a href="Moanda">Moanda</a> on 2 October 1962.

In 1957, Georges Perrineau was appointed a director of the Mokta company and a member of the Executive Committee. 
In 1962 he became vice-president and, at the end of 1962 replaced Henri Lafond as president of the SACEM subsidiary that exploited the Imini manganese deposits in Morocco.
Henri Lafond was assassinated in Paris on 6 March 1963, apparently by an OAS member because he refused to support the OAS with the companies in his group.
He was succeeded as head of the Mokta company by Perrineau, who also became head of the Compagnie des Mines de Huaron, in which Mokta had a large stake. Perrineau was president of Mokta until 1970.
In 1965 Perrineau presided over the company's centenary celebrations in Côte-d'Ivoire, which were attended by President <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Houphou%C3%ABt-Boigny">Félix Houphouët-Boigny</a>.

In 1965 the company took a minority stake in the company formed to exploit chromium ore in Madagascar, directed by Ugine.
In July 1967 France and Niger made agreements that included recognition of a uranium mining concession in Niger to be capitalized 45% by the Atomic Energy Commission, 40% by the private French companies Mokta El Hadid and French Uranium-ore, and 15% by the state of Niger.
The exploitation company was Somaïr.
Also in 1967 the merger activity between Suez and the Banque de l'Union parisienne caused Suez to become a direct shareholder in Mokta, and also in Huaron and Comuf.
In 1968 Mokta joined forces with <a href="Pechiney">Pechiney</a> to form the Péchiney Mokta mining company, which would manage various uranium operations and fund research activity, particularly in <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, Canada.

In October 1970 the Société le Nickel, soon after to become the Imetal holding company, took over the Mokta company through a share swap.
Perrineau remained a director and advisor.
In 1980 Imetal absorbed Mokta, which was renamed Compagnie française de Mokta (CFM).
As of 1991 the Compagnie française de Mokta was a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="COGEMA">COGEMA</a> (Compagnie générale des matières nucléaires), a French company involved in mining and processing uranium.

The building was designed as the headquarters of the 4th Battalion the <a href="Green%20Howards">Green Howards</a> and was completed in 1911. The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. In 1938 the battalion headquarters moved to Lytton Street in <a href="Middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a>, but shortly after the end of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, elements of B Company, 4th Battalion The Green Howards returned to the Thirsk Road drill hall.

After the 4th battalion amalgamated with the 5th Battalion to form the 4th/5th Battalion, The Green Howards in 1961, the presence at the drill hall was disbanded. However, in 1993 a platoon sized detachment from C Company of that regiment was reformed at the drill hall. Following the amalgamations that led to the formation of the <a href="Yorkshire%20Regiment">Yorkshire Regiment</a> in 2006, it was a detachment from B Company of the 4th Battalion of the new regiment that maintained the presence.

Pavona maldivensis

Pavona maldivensis is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="Colony%20%28biology%29">colonial</a> <a href="Scleractinia">stony coral</a> in the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Agariciidae">Agariciidae</a>. It is found on shallow reef slopes, particularly those with strong wave action, and on vertical surfaces, in tropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

Description.
"P. maldivensis" can be encrusting or massive, or a mixture of the two, and can form clumps over a metre in diameter, although colonies smaller than across are more usual. In areas with strong water movement they tend to form cylindrical, finger-like growths while elsewhere they may form horizontal plates, often with "leafy" edges. The <a href="corallite">corallite</a>s (stony cups in which the polyps sit) are circular and of irregular sizes, and have individual but indistinct stony walls. This coral is usually some shade of greyish-brown or green but can be bright orange.

Distribution and habitat.
"P. maldivensis" has a wide distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. Its range extends from the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a> and <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, through the southwestern and central <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, northern Australia, southern Japan and the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>, to the western, central and eastern <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>.

Ecology.
"P. maldivensis" is a <a href="Zooxanthellae">zooxanthellate</a> species of coral; this means that its tissues contain symbiotic single celled algae which provide part of its nutritional requirements. These contain <a href="chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a> and tend to be some shade of brown or green, but in this coral there is an additional <a href="Photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> pigment, <a href="phycoerythrin">phycoerythrin</a>. In daylight, this absorbs light at one wavelength and transmits it at another, giving a bright orange <a href="fluorescence">fluorescence</a>.

In aquaria.
"P. maldivensis" and other species in this genus are kept in <a href="reef%20aquarium">reef aquarium</a>s where they are said to be easy small stony corals for beginners to care for.

The ruins of Liebeneck Castle were once a <a href="high%20mediaeval">high mediaeval</a> <a href="spur%20castle">spur castle</a> in the southwestern part of the <a href="Heckeng%C3%A4u">Heckengäu</a>, a forested region southeast of the village of <a href="W%C3%BCrm%20%28Pforzheim%29">Würm</a>, in the county of <a href="Pforzheim">Pforzheim</a> in the south German state of <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>.

Location.
The castle ruins are situated on heights above the <a href="W%C3%BCrm%20%28Nagold%29">River Würm</a> with a view over the Würm valley. They lie in a "<a href="Bannwald">Bannwald</a>", a protected forest, at 415 metres above <a href="Normalnull">sea level</a>. The ruins of Liebeneck cannot be reached by car; only forest tracks such as the "<a href="Ostweg">Ostweg</a>" lead to it.

History.
The original castle was probably built in the 12th century. It is first mentioned in 1236 on the occasion of the transfer of the castle and village of <a href="W%C3%BCrm%20%28Pforzheim%29">Würm</a> from the lords of Weißenstein at Kräheneck to Margrave Rudolph of Baden. The castle was intended to guard the <a href="road%20toll%20%28historical%29">rafting toll station</a> by the river.. Later the castle was an inherited fief of the lords of <a href="House%20of%20Wei%C3%9Fenstein">Weißenstein</a> before ending up in the possession of the lords of <a href="Leutrum%20von%20Ertingen">Leutrum von Ertingen</a>.

In 1692, during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Palatine%20Succession">Orleans War</a>, the castle was razed.
In 1828 it was transferred to the state of Baden. The site was then deliberately destroyed so that "no riff-raff will find shelter there" (""Gesindel dort keinen Unterschlupf findet""). From 1968 to 1977 the 30-metre-high "<a href="bergfried">bergfried</a>" was renovated.

Site.
Of the original castle, the "bergfried" and several walls surrounding the castle courtyard survive. The double, pentagonal <a href="enceinte">enceinte</a> with its foreworks and <a href="zwinger%20%28architecture%29">zwingers</a> are a feature of this <a href="heritage%20site">heritage site</a>.

<doc id="54869020" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54869020" title="Arnaq">
Arnaq

Arnaq or Egnock ( – November 1577) was a <a href="Canada">Canada</a> Native American woman captured by Sir <a href="Martin%20Frobisher">Martin Frobisher</a> on his second journey to find the <a href="North%20West%20passage">North West passage</a>. She and her daughter Nutaaq were amongst the first Native Americans to visit Britain. They arrived and died the same year.

Life.
Arnaq was born in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> in the sixteenth century. The name used for her by her captors is very similar to the Inuit word for "woman", so her real name is unknown.

She and Nutaaq were amongst four Inuit brought to Britain against their will by Frobisher. Kalicho died of wounds received by the British. After he had been given a post-mortem by Dr. <a href="Edward%20Dodding">Edward Dodding</a>, Arnaq was obliged to witness his burial at <a href="St%20Stephen%27s%20Church%2C%20Bristol">St Stephen's Church</a> in Bristol on 8 November 1577. Dodding commented on what he saw as her stoicism at Kalicho's fate. Dodding's motives for making Arnaq witness the funeral was because he wanted to ensure that Arnaq did not think that the British were cannibals. Dodding showed Arnaq dead human bones to illustrate his point.

Shortly after the funeral, Arnaq, became ill from what is thought to be <a href="measles">measles</a>. She died within days and was buried on the 12 November at St Stephen's church. Kalicho and Arnaq were called Collichang and Egnock respectively in the church's burial records. Arnaq's death left Nutaaq an orphan. Nutaaq was given a nurse and taken to London for a prospective audience with Queen Elizabeth. Nutaaq also died, probably from measles. He was buried without record at <a href="St%20Olave%20Hart%20Street">St Olave Hart Street</a> church.

Legacy.
Arnaq and her daughter were not the first to visit people from the Americas to visit Europe. Its is estimated that 200 may have visited France in the sixteenth century. However Britain was behind in transatlantic journeys and only a small number of Americans had visited before Arnaq had arrived. Despite not living long, Arnaq, Nutaaq and Kalicho did become well known due to the pictures drawn of them. The most noted of these are by <a href="John%20White%20%28colonist%20and%20artist%29">John White</a> who may have been on Frobisher's 1577 voyage. Another two pictures were commissioned by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth">Queen Elizabeth</a> who was disappointed to have not seen Frobishers Inuit. Studies of the portraits show that Arnaq had facial tattoos and details can be noted of the parka she wore.
