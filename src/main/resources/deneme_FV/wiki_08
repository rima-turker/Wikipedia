Gnaeus Domitius Lucanus

Gnaeus Domitius Lucanus was a <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> <a href="Roman%20senate">senator</a> and military commander active in the first century AD. His full name is Gnaeus Domitius Afer Titius Marcellus Curvius Lucanus. He was <a href="Roman%20consul">suffect consul</a> sometime between 76 and 78.

Lucanus was the son of Sextus Curvius Tullus of <a href="Gallia%20Narbonensis">Gallia Narbonensis</a>, and a woman whose name likely was Titia Marcellia. <a href="Pliny%20the%20Younger">Pliny the Younger</a> explains that their father had been prosecuted by the orator <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Afer">Gnaeus Domitius Afer</a> and was successful in stripping the elder Tullus of his citizenship and wealth; however Afer than made both Lucanus and his brother <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Tullus">Gnaeus Domitius Tullus</a> his heirs through <a href="adoption%20in%20ancient%20Rome">testamentary heirs</a>, leaving them his fortune on the condition they took his family name as theirs.

Career.
His "<a href="cursus%20honorum">cursus honorum</a>" is recorded in two inscriptions, and provides an outline of his life. He started his senatorial career likely in his teens as a member of the "quattuorviri viarum curandarum", one of the four boards of the "<a href="vigintiviri">vigintiviri</a>", a minor "collegia" young senators serve in at the start of their careers. This was followed by service as a <a href="military%20tribune">military tribune</a> in <a href="Legio%20V%20Alaudae">Legio V Alaudae</a>, the same legion his brother Tullus served in. Lucanus then proceeded through the ranks of republican magistracies, first as <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a> assisting the <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a>ar governor of <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Africa</a>, then as <a href="plebeian%20tribune">plebeian tribune</a> and <a href="praetor">praetor</a>, after which he and his brother were appointed "<a href="legatus">legatus</a>", or commander, of <a href="Legio%20III%20Augusta">Legio III Augusta</a>, a posting that included governing the province of <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a>, from the year 70 to 73; <a href="Werner%20Eck">Werner Eck</a> suggests Lucanus handled the civilian responsibilities while Tullus commanded the legion. After this, he and his brother were <a href="adlecti">adlected</a> into the <a href="Patrician%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">Patrician</a> class by the emperors <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a> and <a href="Titus">Titus</a> in 72/73. The exact reason for their promotion is not recorded, but during their <a href="Roman%20censor">censorship</a> Vespasian and Titus promoted a number of people either to the Senate or as Patricians for their support during the <a href="Year%20of%20Four%20Emperors">Year of Four Emperors</a>.

Following his "adlectio", Lucanus served as prefect over a <a href="vexillatio">vexillatio</a>n of soldiers who campaigned against German tribes, and for his success he received "<a href="dona%20militaria">dona militaria</a>", or military awards, appropriate to his rank. This was followed by his admission into the "<a href="epulones">septemviri Epulonum Fetales</a>", one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods. Then he was appointed proconsular governor of Africa, assisted by his brother Tullus as his "legatus" in 84/85.

Family.
If that Lucanus and Tullus held the same office at the same time was not sufficient evidence that these brothers were very close, then Pliny's letter written following Tullus' death from years of living as an invalid, where he provides a clear example of their loyalty to each other would provide it.

Lucanus married the daughter of <a href="Titus%20Curtilius%20Mancia">Titus Curtilius Mancia</a>, suffect consul in 55; her name is not recorded. With her Lucanus had a daughter, Domitia Lucilla. However Mancia developed a hatred for Lucanus, and offered to make Lucilla his heir only if Lucanus released her from his power as <a href="paterfamilias">paterfamilias</a>; this would prevent Lucanus from benefiting from the inheritance. This Lucanus did, only to have his brother and her uncle Tullus then adopt her.

Domitia Lucilla would later marry <a href="Publius%20Calvisius%20Tullus%20Ruso">Publius Calvisius Tullus Ruso</a>, and their daughter <a href="Domitia%20Lucilla">Domitia Lucilla</a> was the mother of the emperor <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>.

Ross Francis Gollan (2 October 1902 – 11 November 1961) was an Australian journalist who was known for his work as a <a href="political%20reporter">political reporter</a> for "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>". He worked for the paper from 1923 until his death, and was a member of the <a href="Canberra%20Press%20Gallery">Canberra Press Gallery</a> from 1940 to 1946.

Early years.
Gollan was born in <a href="Bowral%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bowral, New South Wales</a>, to Nellie (née Sullivan) and Colin Gollan. He attended <a href="Sydney%20Boys%20High%20School">Sydney Boys High School</a>, where he was a prefect, rugby player, and editor of the school magazine. Gollan went on to the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>, graduating with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> in 1923 and a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a> in 1925. He edited "<a href="Hermes%20%28publication%29">Hermes</a>", the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney%20Union">University of Sydney Union</a>'s journal.

Career.
Gollan joined "The Sydney Morning Herald" as a cadet in 1923. He transferred to <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a> in 1928, where he covered (among other things) the frequent industrial disputes in the <a href="Hunter%20Region">Hunter Region</a>'s coal industry. Gollan was sent to <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> in 1940 to report on <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">federal parliament</a>.

Gollan was recalled to Sydney in 1946, and was assigned various managerial and administrative positions. He returned to writing in 1960, authoring a <a href="gossip%20column">gossip column</a>, "Sydney Spectator".

The 1879 series like <a href="Ord%C3%B3%C3%B1ez%20guns">Ordóñez guns</a> of the same period were <a href="Glossary%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">breech loading</a>, <a href="black%20powder">black powder</a>, <a href="Built-up%20gun">built up guns</a>, with steel A tube and <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> reinforcing <a href="hoop%20gun">hoops</a>. The 1883 series was a step forward in that they were breech loading, built up guns, with <a href="Forging">forged steel</a> A tube and forged steel reinforcing hoops. The Hontoria 1883 series ranged in size from to and were 35 calibers in length. They were produced by the <a href="Arsenal%20de%20la%20Carraca">Arsenal de la Carraca</a> in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cadiz</a> and the Royal Ordnance Works at Trubia in <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a>.

Igor V. Komarov was awarded the title of Professor in 2007.

Contribution to research.
The areas of scientific interests of Igor V. Komarov are <a href="medicinal%20chemistry">medicinal chemistry</a> and <a href="Organic%20synthesis">synthesis</a> of model compounds, which can be used to obtain new knowledge in <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, <a href="stereochemistry">stereochemistry</a>, <a href="theoretical%20chemistry">theoretical chemistry</a>, <a href="catalysis">catalysis</a>. Igor has over 100 <a href="Peer%20review">peer reviewed</a> <a href="Academic%20publishing">research papers</a>, <a href="h-index">h-index</a> 22, has guided 6 <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">PhD students</a> to date. Igor's scientific group puts the main focus on developing of novel synthetic methods and design of theoretically interesting molecules, part of which were created and synthesized in tight collaboration with Prof. Anthony J. <a href="http%3A//www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/ajk1">Kirby</a> from <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">the University of Cambridge</a> (United Kingdom). One of such collaborative projects was synthesis, study of stereochemistry and <a href="Chemical%20property">chemical properties</a> of 1-aza-2-adamantanone and its derivatives. A trimethyl-substituted derivative ("the most twisted amide", "Kirby's amide") was designed in the Prof. Kirby's laboratory and synthesized by Igor in 1997 during his postdoctoral stay in Cambridge. In 2014, a <a href="Parent">parent molecule</a> was made in Igor's group in collaboration with Prof. Kirby. The compound modelled the transition state of "cis"-"trans" isomerization of <a href="Amide">amides</a> and allowed obtaining fundamental <a href="knowledge">knowledge</a> about the <a href="Peptide%20bond">amide bond</a>.

Igor V. Komarov started his <a href="research">research</a> in the area of <a href="synthetic%20organic%20chemistry">synthetic organic chemistry</a> at the beginning of 1990th, working on <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> of <a href="Aromaticity">aromatic</a> <a href="Heterocyclic%20compound">heterocyclic compounds</a> by <a href="Phosphorus%20acid">phosphorus(V) acid</a> halides. At that time, convenient phosphorylation methods were developed, which now find use, for example, for synthesis of <a href="Materials%20science">materials</a> applicable for <a href="uranium">uranium</a> <a href="Extraction%20%28chemistry%29">extraction</a>. Later, working in Rostock, Igor V. Komarov changed the direction of his research and got interested in <a href="Homogeneous%20catalysis">homogenous</a> <a href="Enantioselective%20synthesis">asymmetric catalysis</a>. The study of catalysis was carried out using model compounds: functionalized <a href="camphor">camphor</a>- and <a href="tartaric%20acid">tartaric acid</a>-derived <a href="Chirality%20%28chemistry%29">chiral</a> <a href="Ligand">ligands</a> were synthesized such as <a href="Phosphine">monophosphines</a>, <a href="diphosphines">diphosphines</a>, and then <a href="Rhodium">Rhodium</a>(I) <a href="Coordination%20complex">complexes</a> with them. The complexes were used for asymmetric <a href="Hydrogenation">homogenous hydrogenation</a> of <a href="Prochirality">prochiral</a> <a href="Substrate%20%28chemistry%29">substrates</a>, and the obtained results allowed elucidating the effects of oxo- and oxy-<a href="Functional%20group">functional groups</a> in ligands on efficiency and <a href="Functional%20selectivity">selectivity</a> of the catalysts. These works led to introduction of efficient catalysts to synthetic practice, like catASium, some of them bearing a camphor-derived ligand ROCKYPhos  (named after the cities <a href="Rostock">ROstok</a> and <a href="Kiev">KYiv</a>).

Although Igor's interest to the synthesis of chiral ligands has not been faded, he changed the general direction of his research once more, and now he works in the area of <a href="drug%20design">drug design</a>. One of the main design principle is restriction of <a href="Conformation%20%28chemistry%29">conformational mobility</a> of the <a href="Drug%20discovery">drug candidate</a> <a href="Molecule">molecules</a>. Prof. Komarov's research group developed many approaches to synthesis of conformationally restricted <a href="Amine">amines</a> and <a href="Amino%20acid">amino acids</a> - the <a href="Building%20block%20%28chemistry%29">building blocks</a> for drug design. Numerous conformationally restricted <a href="Organofluorine%20chemistry">fluorine</a>-containing amino acids were also designed and synthesized, with a purpose of using them as labels to study <a href="Peptide">peptides</a> in <a href="Lipid%20bilayer">lipid bilayers</a> by <a href="Solid-state%20NMR">solid-state NMR spectroscopy</a>.

Igor V. Komarov's group made a contribution to design and synthesis of light-controllable biologically active compounds - <a href="Photoactivated%20peptide">photocontrollable peptides</a> - potential candidates for <a href="photopharmacology">photopharmacology</a> drugs. Photopharmacology drugs can be <a href="Drug%20administration">administered</a> in the inactive, <a href="non-toxic">non-toxic</a> form, and then activated ("switched on") by <a href="light">light</a> only when and where required to treat localized <a href="Lesion">lesions</a> (e.g.in <a href="Neoplasm">solid tumors</a>). The activation by light can be done with very high spatiotemporal precision in the lesion site, leaving the rest of the <a href="patient">patient</a> body unaffected. After the treatment, the photopharmacology drugs can be inactivated ("switched off") by light in order to diminish <a href="Side%20effect">side-effects</a> and <a href="Environmental%20protection">environmental burden</a>.

Another research direction in the Igor V. Komarov's scientific group is navigation of <a href="chemical%20space">chemical space</a>. A method of structural comparison for organic molecules was developed which employed exit vector plot analysis. <a href="Enumeration">Enumeration</a> of molecules (exhaustive generation of all theoretically possible structures) was carried out for some classes of organic compounds, for example, for conformationally restricted <a href="Diamine">diamines</a>.

In the area of <a href="nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, Igor V. Komarov's research group studied <a href="Cell-penetrating%20peptide">cell-penetrating peptides</a> as carriers for carbon-based <a href="Fluorescence">fluorescent</a> <a href="Nanoparticle">nanoparticles</a>, shuttling them inside <a href="Eucaryotic%20cells">eukaryotic cells</a> with the purpose of <a href="Microscopy">bioimaging</a>.

Igor V. Komarov has a Ukrainian patent, 2 international patents, is a co-authors of <a href="Textbook">text-books</a> on NMR spectroscopy.

Augustinerkirche, Mainz

The church of St. Augustin known in German as Augustinerkirche, was the <a href="Minster%20%28church%29">minster</a> of the <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Augustine">Augustine friars</a> in the city centre of <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a>. Today it is the seminary church of the Catholic theological seminary of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Mainz">Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz</a>.

History.
The church was built from 1768 to 1771 on the site of a Gothic church building on the Augustinian Street, dating to 1260. The builders were Augustinian hermits, who had already built the predecessor building and whose fraternity endured from 1260 to the Imperial <a href="Reichsdeputationshauptschluss">Reichsdeputationshauptschluss</a> of 1803. The name of the <a href="Master%20builder">master mason</a> is not known.

After the secularization of the monastery in 1803, the building ensemble became a seminary comprising a church of the diocese of the newly created bishopric in 1805. The church was not destroyed in World War II.

Architecture.
Despite its late origins, the exterior of the church is very much associated with the <a href="Baroque%20architecture">baroque style</a>. Due to the surrounding property with the <a href="convent">convent</a> and seminar buildings and other houses, it is only possible to see the church with its mighty towerless façade that overlooks the other buildings of the old town. Above the portal rises a group of personalities created for the church by Nikolaus Binterim. It is essentially the coronation of Mary, <a href="Queen%20of%20Heaven">Queen of Heaven</a>, flanked by <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, patron saint and ruler of the Augustinian order, and his mother <a href="Monica%20of%20Hippo">Monica of Hippo</a>. In the south and east of the church are the former convent buildings and rooms of the seminar, which were built between 1737 and 1753. The wing of the monastery complex has a beautiful portal with figures, which also come from Nikolas Binterim, after the façade of the church itself. The interior of the church tends to <a href="rococo">rococo</a>, which is expressed by a fusion of <a href="nave">nave</a> and <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a> a concept that is increasingly found in the Rococo stylistic.

Interior.
The altars are according to the Rococo style, but the late construction of the church is illustrated here in that the echoes of <a href="Classicism">Classicism</a> can be found. The furnishing makes a very rich impression through the large altars and the ceiling paintings created by <a href="Johann%20Baptist%20Enderle">Johann Baptist Enderle</a> in 1772.

In the church a <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary, mother of Jesus</a> sculpture of 1420 is displayed, which was transferred to the Augustin church in 1807 from the demolished Gothic ″Liebfrauenkirche″ (<a href="St.%20Maria%20ad%20Gradus">St. Maria ad Gradus</a>), located beneath <a href="Mainz%20Cathedral">Mainz Cathedral</a>.
Pipe organ.
As one of the few examples of a baroque <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a> one of the famous organ manufacturer family <a href="Stumm">Stumm</a> is placed in the Augustinian church, since 1773 the organ has been preserved to a large extent original. The instrument has 31 registers on two manuals and pedal. The play-and register <a href="tracker%20action">tracker action</a>s are mechanical.

Gnaeus Domitius Tullus

Gnaeus Domitius Tullus was a <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> <a href="Roman%20senate">senator</a> and military commander active in the first century AD. His full name is Gnaeus Domitius Curvius Tullus. He was twice <a href="Roman%20consul">suffect consul</a>: the first time between 76 and 78; the second time for the "<a href="nundinium">nundinium</a>" of 13-31 January 98 as the colleague of <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a>.

Tullus was the son of Sextus Curvius Tullus of <a href="Gallia%20Narbonensis">Gallia Narbonensis</a>, and a woman whose name likely was Titia Marcellia. <a href="Pliny%20the%20Younger">Pliny the Younger</a> explains that their father had been prosecuted by the orator <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Afer">Gnaeus Domitius Afer</a> and was successful in stripping the elder Tullus of his citizenship and wealth; however Afer than made both Tullus and his brother <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Lucanus">Gnaeus Domitius Lucanus</a> his heirs through <a href="adoption%20in%20ancient%20Rome">testamentary heirs</a>, leaving them his fortune on the condition they took his family name as theirs.

Career.
His "<a href="cursus%20honorum">cursus honorum</a>" is recorded in two inscriptions, and provides an outline of his life. Tullus started his senatorial career likely in his teens as a member of the "decemviri stlitibus iudicandis", one of the four boards of the "<a href="vigintiviri">vigintiviri</a>", a minor "collegia" young senators serve in at the start of their careers. This was followed by service as a <a href="military%20tribune">military tribune</a> in <a href="Legio%20V%20Alaudae">Legio V Alaudae</a>, the same legion his brother Tullus served in. Lucanus then proceeded through the ranks of republican magistracies, first as <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a> assisting an unnamed emperor (likely <a href="Nero">Nero</a> whose name was commonly omitted from inscriptions due to "<a href="damnatio%20memoriae">damnatio memoriae</a>"), then as <a href="plebeian%20tribune">plebeian tribune</a> and <a href="praetor">praetor</a>, after which he and his brother were appointed "<a href="legatus">legatus</a>", or commander, of <a href="Legio%20III%20Augusta">Legio III Augusta</a>, a posting that included governing the province of <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a>, from the year 70 to 73; <a href="Werner%20Eck">Werner Eck</a> suggests Lucanus handled the civilian responsibilities while Tullus commanded the legion. After this, he and his brother were <a href="adlecti">adlected</a> into the <a href="Patrician%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">Patrician</a> class by the emperors <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a> and <a href="Titus">Titus</a> in 72/73. The exact reason for their promotion is not recorded, but during their <a href="Roman%20censor">censorship</a> Vespasian and Titus promoted a number of people either to the Senate or as Patricians for their support during the <a href="Year%20of%20Four%20Emperors">Year of Four Emperors</a>.

Following his "adlectio", Tullus served as prefect over a <a href="vexillatio">vexillatio</a>n of soldiers who campaigned against German tribes, and for his success he received the "<a href="dona%20militaria">dona militaria</a>", or military awards, appropriate to his rank. This was followed by his admission into the "<a href="epulones">septemviri Epulonum Fetales</a>", one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods. Then he served for a year as "legatus" to his brother Lucanus, <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a>ar governor of <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Africa</a> (84/85), before serving as proconsular governor of Africa himself in 85/86.

Tullus' active life left him "gnarled and crippled in every limb", to quote Pliny, who notes that Tullus was so enfeebled "he could change his posture only with the help of others" and needed help to wash and brush his teeth. "He was often heard to say," Pliny continues, "when he was complaining about the indignities of his weakened state, that every day he licked the fingers of his slaves."

Family.
If that Lucanus and Tullus held the same office at the same time was not sufficient evidence that these brothers were very close, then Pliny's letter written following Tullus' death, where he provides a clear example of their loyalty to each other would provide it.

Lucanus married the daughter of <a href="Titus%20Curtilius%20Mancia">Titus Curtilius Mancia</a>, suffect consul in 55; with her Lucanus had a daughter, Domitia Lucilla. However Mancia developed a hatred for Lucanus, and offered to make Lucilla his heir only if Lucanus released her from his power as <a href="paterfamilias">paterfamilias</a>; this would prevent Lucanus from benefiting from the inheritance. This Lucanus did, only to have Tullus then adopt her.

From Pliny's letter, it is unclear whether Tullus had any children of his own. He mentions he had married a woman, "with a distinguished pedigree and an honest character" while he was old and crippled and enfeebled with his illness, and that she had been married before but was a widow, and had children from her previous marriage. He praises her perseverance for remaining by his side despite his condition, yet Pliny does not tell us her name.

Therefore he moved to <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a> to study painting and advertizing at the <a href="Columbus%20College%20of%20Art%20and%20Design">Columbus College of Art and Design</a> (1981-1986). 

Miller's first significant urban renewal project was the Artist Village, where he occupied an artist studio. As part of his "urban beautification" work he painted murals on exterior walls of the Artist Village complex, as well as other buildings in the neighbourhood.

Social Impact.
Miller's first project, PAWZ, provides art programs and positive role models to more than 1000 inner city children per year.

The synodic act of the heretic of Armenin, the martyr Martin

The Synodic Act of the Heretic of Armenin [Armenia], The Martyr Martin (<a href="Church%20Slavonic%20language">Church Slavonic</a>: Собо́рное дҍѧ́нїе на єретика́ армѧни́на, на мни́ха марти́на) is a forged work created at the very beginning of the 18th century by <a href="Dimitry%20of%20Rostov">Dimitry Rostovsky</a> against the <a href="Old%20Ritualism">Old Rite</a> shortly before his death, and was actively used by the missionaries of the  in <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> who were attempting to convert the <a href="Old%20Believers">Old Believers</a>. The main character of the Synodic Act of the Heretic of Armenia is Martin Armenin or Martin the Armenian - a <a href="heretic">heretic</a> and a <a href="monk">monk</a>. Martin Armenin was included as the name of a true person in many authoritative historical monographs and in the liturgical text in the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>.

Today, the Russian Orthodox Church recognizes that the work is a forgery, as stated by Patriarch Kirill in the Russian Orthodox Encyclopedia.

Background Information and Reasons for Creating the Forgery.
In the middle of the 17th century, reforms began in the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Church</a> by <a href="Patriarch%20Nikon%20of%20Moscow">Patriarch Nikon</a>, rituals were unified by Greek models. To this end, the Russian ancient rites were declared heretical, and their followers were proclaimed heretics and anathematized. (Some then-saints were included in these anathemas, such as <a href="Anna%20of%20Kashin">Saint Anna of Kashin</a>, whom had been previously glorified.)

Even before the start of the reform,  had a debate with the Greeks regarding how to fold the fingers while making the sign of the cross. The Greeks reproached Arseny, claiming that the Russians were baptized like Armenians, to which Arseny (correctly) replied that the Armenians preserved the ancient tradition. At the Moscow Local Council in 1656, the Patriarch of Antioch, <a href="Macarios%20III%20Zaim">Macarius</a> (who would later unsuccessfully attempt to unite his church with Rome), announced those <a href="baptizing">baptizing</a> in this way were "arrogant imitators", and the bishops signed this decision. <a href="Boris%20Uspensky">B.A. Uspensky</a> explains this by the fact that Armenians, like the Russians, were baptized in the 17th century with a double finger sign of the cross, unlike all the other monophysites. In his opinion, the Armenians had adopted the two-finger sign of the cross earlier from the Greeks.

After the church anathemas (the Synod of 1656 and the <a href="Great%20Moscow%20Synod">Great Moscow Synod</a>), and the unsuccessful but brutal repressions of those who continued using the Old Rite - consisting of torture and murder - a new direction was chosen to fight the Old Rite: the taxation of the Old Believers with a double tax and the use of falsifications. Following this decision, the future Russian Orthodox saint Dimitry of Rostov created the Synodic Act.

The Forgery.
Less than a year before his death, during the reign of <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter I</a>, Dimitry of Rostov created the forged anti-<a href="Old%20Ritualism">Old Rite</a> work "The Synodic Act on the Heretic of Armenien, the Martyr Martin". The document claims that a monk and heretic named Martin, an Armenian, arrived in Russia from Constantinople in 1149, and pretending to be a Greek and a relative of the patriarch Luke Chrysosterg, began to preach in Russia heresy. This heresy consisted of a combination of Armenian and Latin heresies (and according to the "Acts", Martin learned this heresy Rome itself). Subsequently, adopted by the Russians, the heresy consisted of making the sign of the cross with two fingers, saying the Jesus Prayer instead of the name of the Trinity while making the sign of the cross, and using two alleluias instead of three alleluias. Especially for his heresy of making the sign of the cross with two fingers, he was condemned at the Council of Kiev in 1160, under the <a href="Rostislav%20I%20of%20Kiev">Grand Duke Rostislav Mstislavich</a> and Metropolitan Constantine. Later, he was condemned at the Council of Constantinople during the following year, 1161, under <a href="Luke%20Chrysoberges">Patriarch Luke Chrysoberges</a>, from which the document claims to originate. Subsequently, Martin was burned.

Promotion of the Forgery by the Russian Orthodox Church.
A book with a story about the alleged heretic Martin was printed with the blessing of the Most Holy Synod repeatedly, in 1721, 1726, 1752, and - finally - in 1913. In addition, <a href="Dimitry%20of%20Rostov">Dimitry of Rostov</a> was canonized, and at the end of the 18th century he was written by an akathist which included a section about the mythical heretic Martin. The akathist was written by a priest of the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Christ%20the%20Saviour">Moscow Cathedral of Christ the Savior</a>, John Alexeyev. The text of the akathist was studied at three meetings of the Holy Synod in 1800 (July 2, July 13 and August 8). The synod then approved the text of the akathist and gave him the blessing to print it, which was done, and it is still the akathist used for him today.

A rough translation of the akathist to <a href="Dimitry%20of%20Rostov">Dimitry of Rostov</a>, fourth kontakion:The storm of heresies, from the underworld through Aria in Greece, was revived in the latter days by the machinations of Martin Armenin; and through the [Old Believers] in the Fatherland, still attempts to silence and destroy the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. You, the good shepherd, for the love of your sheep, you drove away these soul-destroying wolves, you tamed the storm of insanity, and you taught the faithful to say to the Trinitarian God: Alleluia.The Troparion in Tone VIII hints at his work against the Old Believers as well:O lover of Orthodoxy and uprooter of schism, healer of Russia and new advocate before God, by thy writings thou didst heal the minds of the foolish. O blessed Demetrius, thou harp of the Spirit, entreat Christ God, that our souls may be saved.In addition, the mythical heretic Martin and his condemnation by the invented Kiev Synod were taught as a real event in the higher spiritual educational institutions, including the theological academy, where the priesthood and bishops were being prepared, and the priests from the pulpit preached throughout the Synodal period as though Martin was a true historical figure. The name of Martin can be found in a large number of authors of the synodal period, including but not limited to: <a href="Arsenius%20%28Matseyevich%29">Saint Metropolitan Arsenius (Matseyevich)</a>, <a href="Simon%2C%20Metropolitan%20of%20Moscow">Metropolitan Simon of Moscow</a>, <a href="Nikephoros%20Theotokis">Archbishop Nikephoros Theotokis</a>, the Optina elder <a href="https%3A//oca.org/saints/lives/2017/05/09/148995-venerable-joseph-of-optina">Saint Joseph of Optina</a>, Archimandrite Jerome (Alyakrinsky), <a href="Theophan%20the%20Recluse">Saint Theophan the Recluse</a>, <a href="Macarius%20Bulgakov">Metropolitan Macarius (Bulgakov)</a>, and <a href="Ignatius%20Bryanchaninov">Saint Ignatius (Bryanchaninov)</a>.

A number of secular historians, such as <a href="Sergey%20Solovyov">Sergey Solovyov</a>, also wrote about Martin Armenin as a real historical person.

The Committee to Defend the President was first established as the hybrid Stop Hillary PAC in 2013. The PAC changed its name to the Committee to Defend the President in 2017. <a href="Ted%20Harvey">Ted Harvey</a>, a Republican official, chairs the Committee.

Leadership.
Harvey, a former member of the <a href="Colorado%20Senate">Colorado Senate</a>, is the chairman of the Committee to Defend the President. A former staffer in the <a href="Reagan%20White%20House">Reagan White House</a>, Harvey is a vocal critic of “the Left and their media allies” for, in his view, unfairly attacking the president. He claims <a href="Donald%20Trump">President Donald Trump</a> is facing an “unprecedented onslaught of liberal intolerance and hate.”

Political Activity.
In 2016, Stop Hillary PAC’s primary objective was to oppose <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> in her bid for the presidency. The PAC was highly critical of Clinton’s handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks. The PAC ran a TV advertisement featuring former <a href="J.%20Christopher%20Stevens">Ambassador Christopher Stevens</a>’ grave.

The Committee’s current mission is to defend President Trump from “attacks from the radical left” as he “sets about undoing the progressive policies that are destroying our nation,” and work to re-elect the president in 2020. It runs ads, conducts polls, publishes opinion editorials, and mobilizes grassroots activists.

In January 2017, the Committee ran a TV ad urging viewers to call a toll-free number and pledge their support “to defend Donald Trump.” It has also run ads touting President Trump’s accomplishments in his first 100 days, including nominating judge <a href="Neil%20Gorsuch">Neil Gorsuch</a> to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>.

Funding.
The Committee receives most of its funding from small-dollar donors. During the first half of 2017, it raised more than $3 million, the most among pro-Trump super PACs.

Real Madrid Rugby

Real Madrid Rugby was the <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> section of <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid C.F.</a>. Established in 1924, the squad achieved several regional and national titles before the section was closed in 1948.

Although the section is currently extinct, there were some attempts to re-introduce the practise of rugby, but they were not finally carried out, including an unsuccessful agreement with rugby club <a href="CRC%20Madrid">CRC Madrid</a> to have a team representing them at <a href="Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Honor%20de%20Rugby">División de Honor</a>, the first division of Spanish rugby. 

History.
The rugby section of Real Madrid was established by some young members of the club, with former <a href="association%20football">footballer</a> Eulogio Aranguren among them. On Jan 10, 1925, the squad played its first match v. <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20Rugby">Atlético Madrid</a> in the Stadium Metropolitano, which was won by Real Madrid by 27–0. During its first years of existence, Real Madrid Rugby played in different venues, such as Chamartín, El Estadio, El Campo de Los Suizos and Canillejas.
On January 25, 1925, Real Madrid played Infantry Academy of Toledo at <a href="Estadio%20Chamart%C3%ADn">Estadio Chamartín</a>, with a new win for Real Madrid by 23–9. After the match, the team was also awarded its first trophy. 

At regional level, Real Madrid Rugby won four consecutive Campeonato Regional Centro, during the first years of the 1930s.

In 1934 Real Madrid won its first national title, the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey%20de%20Rugby">Copa del Rey de Rugby</a>, after defeating Universitario de Valencia by 14–6. It would be its only title in that competition. Some of the most notable players of that final were <a href="fly-half">fly-half</a> Carlos García San Miguel and Ramón Resines.

After a hiatus due to <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> (1936–39), the rugby section of Real Madrid finally disappeared in 1948. In an attempt to bring the sport back to the club, in 2008 Real Madrid made arrangements with rugby club <a href="CRC%20Madrid">CRC Madrid</a> (also known as CRC Pozuelo) to be represented in the Spanish premier league, <a href="Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Honor%20de%20Rugby">División de Honor</a>. When the agreement was about to be signed, president of Real Madrid <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Calder%C3%B3n">Ramón Calderón</a>, who had been the main architect of the return of rugby to the club, resigned from his role following allegations of vote-rigging for the confirmation for the financial budget. Real Madrid exploided into a crisis that suspended many projects and operations in the club, including the rugby section.

With the coming of <a href="Florentino%20P%C3%A9rez">Florentino Pérez</a> to the club for a second term, past negotiations were not resumed. Therefore, rugby section has remained inactive since then.

After that, <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20de%20Madrid">Atlético de Madrid</a> made a deal with CRC Madrid to have a rugby team in the División de Honor. The CRC squad agreed to use the name, shield and colors of Atlético Madrid during the time the agreement was in force.

Clauneck

Clauneck (also called Claunt) is a <a href="goetic">goetic</a> <a href="Demon">daemon</a> appearing in the grimoires "<a href="Solomon">The Secrets of Solomon</a> (The Secrets of Solomon is a 16th or 17th century diabolical text. It contains an early version of many of the demons listed in <a href="Grimorium%20Verum">Grimorium Verum</a>. This <a href="grimoire">grimoire</a> is in the tradition of <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>)", "<a href="Grimorium%20Verum">Grimorium Verum</a>"and "<a href="Dictionnaire%20Infernal">Dictionnaire Infernal</a>." One of the eighteen <a href="wikt%3Aservitor">Servitor</a>s of Syrach, <a href="Clauneck">Clauneck</a> is well loved by <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, and he is summoned because he has the ability to bestow wealth, either by bringing money over a great distance or by assisting in the discovery of hidden treasure. Clauneck is the <a href="demon">demon</a> of wealth, known to be obedient to his summoners, but only to those who show him the proper respect.

The <a href="Grimorium%20Verum">Grimorium Verum</a> says this about Clauneck, he “has power over, goods, money, and finances”, “can bestow great <a href="wealth">wealth</a>”, and finally, “he is much loved by <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>”. Clauneck “much loved by Lucifer” is an agent thereof, and so entrusted with accessing <a href="Astral%20plane">astral</a> bank vault. Clauneck is who a myriad of modern day <a href="Hermeticism">Hermetic occultists</a> demand or beg money from, and while rightly so this is where their understanding of Clauneck’s vast dominion begins and ends.

In the <a href="Grimorium%20Verum">Grimorium Verum</a> <a href="Clauneck">Clauneck</a> is first or “numero uno” in the ordering of the eighteen servitor spirits. Clauneck’s numbering demonstrates his supremacy within the legion’s <a href="hierarchy">hierarchy</a>, and denotes the respect held for him by <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>. However even more importantly the number one is the first indication of value by which all value is essentially an addition or subtraction of “1” or a sum totals of “1s”. 

It is through Clauneck that the tradition contained within the <a href="Grimorium%20Verum">Grimorium Verum</a> can go from “0” or un-manifested to “1” meaning manifested, or a no-thing to a some-thing. A brief dissection of Clauneck’s <a href="Sigil%20%28magic%29">sigil</a> helps glean insight into his nature. The sigil of Clauneck is an amalgamation of the brain, eye, and heart with a hint of the male phallus (the function is the same in respect to female <a href="Sex%20organ">genitalia</a>). The brain, eye, heart and phallus are four <a href="Weighing%20scale">weighing scales</a> by which merit is assessed. 

1. The brain with <a href="knowledge">knowledge</a> and <a href="experience">experience</a>.

2. The eye deciphering ascetic and contour.

3. The heart through <a href="Emotion">emotional reactions</a>. 

4. The phallus by way of <a href="sex">sex</a>ual charge or interest. 

<a href="Clauneck">Clauneck’s</a> <a href="wikt%3Asigil">sigil</a> illustrates how we weigh the merit of whom and what we interact with. As a spirit of acquisition, <a href="commerce">commerce</a>, and wealth, Clauneck is “<a href="free%20market">free market</a>” in the most extreme sense. Just like the “market” Clauneck has no <a href="moral">moral</a> objections, and will offer advice on trafficking humans as dispassionately as he would if queried on the selling of cupcakes. Clauneck cares nothing for the product it’s self, but instead its worth. As off-putting as this seems it terms of unnerving frankness and uncorrupted honesty, Clauneck is priceless in his <a href="unbiased">unbiased</a> <a href="counsel">counsel</a>.

All initiates of the <a href="Goetia">Goetic</a> tradition must willingly stand on Clauneck’s “<a href="auction%20block">auction block</a>”. What transpires is a mentally arduous and physically excruciating <a href="ritual">ritual</a> in which Clauneck evaluates the potential of the subject. A rough but fair rendering is issued and the seeker is left to consider his or her options. Those truly desiring strength will heed the <a href="verdict">verdict</a> and commit themselves to the labors handed down to remedy the discovered short comings. Those who ignore Clauneck’s ruling possibly find themselves bought and sold. The <a href="Mysticism">mystic</a> or <a href="magician%20%28paranormal%29">magician</a> would <a href="Invocation">invoke</a> Clauneck to make a full <a href="wikt%3Aassessment">assessment</a> of their own strengths and weaknesses. There is no other <a href="Goetia">Goetic</a> spirit who can tell you with such exactitude what you ought to either ditch or apply ample spit and polish in order to better sell yourself to potential employers, friends or lovers than Clauneck. 

<a href="Clauneck">Clauneck</a> is conjured with regularity to promote <a href="health">health</a>, wealth and <a href="Well-being">wellbeing</a>. Clauneck falls under the planet <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a> with <a href="Virgo%20%28astrology%29">Virgo</a> as his <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a> sign (27°), which stands for extremity. Clauneck is a day demon, there is no seal of Clauneck because Clauneck is not one of the 72 demons summoned by King Solomon. <a href="Clauneck">Clauneck</a> works under <a href="Goetic%20demons%20in%20popular%20culture">Duke Syrach</a>.

History.
HostGallo was founded in October 2002 by Brent Oxley, who was then a student at <a href="Florida%20Atlantic%20University">Florida Atlantic University</a>. By 2006, HostGallo had passed the 200,000 mark in registered domains.

In 2007, the company moved from the original office in <a href="Boca%20Raton%2C%20Florida">Boca Raton, Florida</a> to a new 20,000 square building in Houston, Texas.

In 2008, <a href="Inc.%20Magazine">Inc. Magazine</a> ranked HostGallo in its list of fastest growing companies at 21 in the United States and 1 in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, Texas area The same year, HostGallo decided to make their hosting service <a href="green%20hosting">green hosting</a> by working with Integrated Ecosystem Market Services. In 2008, HostGallo prepared for competition companies touting themselves as providing "unlimited" hosting services. Founder Brent Oxley was adamant about being able to back up an "unlimited" option prior to offering service named as such and increased staffing. He suggested that this move increased sales by at least 30%.

In 2010 an office was added in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a> In 2011, HostGallo started operations in <a href="India">India</a> with a its office in <a href="Nashik">Nashik</a>, <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> and a data centre.

On 21 June 2012, CEO and founder Brent Oxley announced the sale of HostGallo to <a href="Endurance%20International%20Group">Endurance International Group</a>, advised employees and users not to worry in part because Oxley would still own the buildings HostGallo used. He said he wanted to travel the world before he had children. He was also candid about the failures in creating stable billing and register portions of HostGallo, and hoped that Endurance might fix those. HostGallo was sold to Endurance International Group for $225 million. .

As of 2013, HostGallo hosts over 9 million domains and has over 400,000 customers.

Incidents.
2012 social engineering attack.
In May 2012, the <a href="computer%20hacker">computer hacker</a> group <a href="UGNazi">UGNazi</a> claimed responsibility for hacking the <a href="web%20server">web server</a> of the <a href="Web%20hosting%20service">web host</a> billing software developer WHMCS in an apparent <a href="Social%20engineering%20%28security%29">social engineering attack</a> involving HostGallo. A member of the group Cosmo called WHMCS's hosting provider impersonating a senior employee. They were subsequently granted <a href="Superuser">root access</a> to WHMCS's web server after providing information for identity verification. UGNazi later leaked publicly WHMCS's <a href="SQL">SQL</a> database containing user information and 500,000 customer credit cards, website files, and <a href="cPanel">cPanel</a> configuration. After this issue WHMCS emailed members to change their passwords.

2013 service outages.
Since its acquisition by Endurance International, HostGallo has suffered an increased incidence of server outages and downtime. Notably, on August 2, 2013 and December 31, 2013, Endurance International Group’s data center in Provo, Utah, experienced network outages that affected thousands of customers of <a href="Bluehost">Bluehost</a>, HostGallo, HostMonster and JustHost.

Spring 2014 blackouts.
During the afternoon of April 16, 2014, the data center in Provo, Utah experienced a networking issue that affected customers of HostGallo, HostMonster & Bluehost. The issue was fully rectified only after 24 hours on April 17, 2014 11.35 AM. There was another outage on May 19, 2014 that took nearly 9 hours to completely resolve. This problem occurred in the same data center.

October 2014 outage.
During the morning of October 29, 2014 HostGallo suffered another major outage that affected their reseller accounts. The company did not immediately announce the cause of the outage, though they stated, on Facebook and their forum, that an OS upgrade was the cause of the issue. (They made the reseller sections of their forum inaccessible to the public, visible only to registered users.) The server-level problems were resolved on November 2, 2014, almost five days after the outage began. On November 4, 2014, users were still reporting widespread account-level database problems.

December 2016 outage.
During the afternoon and evening of December 9, 2016, HostGallo experienced a major outage. In their Twitter account, they said: "We are seeing problems w/ network flapping which could be caused by denial of service or other network issues in our switching fabric. We are methodically isolating the issue while making sure we don't deteriorate the network further. It's a large network and we are working on it in sections. Our best team is working through this at our data center and it is our goal to have this resolved very soon. In other words, we know this is frustrating and we are on it! Again, our sincere apologies for this inconvenience.".

Elle Royal

Danielle Prendergast (born September 8, 1989), better known by her stage name Elle Royal (formerly known as Patwa), is an independent Hip-Hop artist hailing from <a href="The%20Bronx%2C%20New%20York">The Bronx, New York</a>. Her breakthrough came in 2010 when her video "What Can I Say" went viral after <a href="WorldStarHipHop">WorldStarHipHop</a> featured her as the “Female Artist of the Week”. Elle Royal later released the mixtape One Gyal Army under Patwa in 2010, followed by the singles “Jammin”, “Lights”, and “Statements” in 2015 under her current stage name, Elle Royal.

Biography.
Elle Royal (formerly Patwa) was born in New York and raised in the Wakefield area of the Bronx, and later, Lawrenceville, Georgia. Both of her parents are from Kingston, Jamaica. Growing up, Elle lived in a multi-family home shared with many cousins, one of which had a studio in his home. It was here that Elle constructed her first rhyme at 14. From there, Elle began writing and recording music in a studio she built in her room. During High School, Elle self-recorded her first mixtape “One Gyal Army” and later released its first single “What Can I Say” in 2010. 

Name Change.
Elle describes her career as Patwa as a time when she was making music for the intent of acquiring commercial success. As she grew older her desire to shed light on topics of importance grew also. It was her belief that females were losing their power and self-worth in a male-dominated society. In an effort to promote higher consciousness and self-esteem among women, Patwa changed her name to Elle Royal and her focus to inspire and empower females. In 2015 she signed and collaborated with female singers, rappers, models and dancers under a new label she founded. She then changed her name to Elle Royal to reflect her new purpose of empowering women. As she explains, “Elle” comes from her first name, Danielle and “Royal” comes from “having the status of a King or Queen”. 

Education.
Elle attended Georgia State University in Atlanta Georgia and graduated Cum Laude with a Bachelor’s degree in Journalism and Political Science. She’s stated she’s worked as a Paralegal throughout her time pursuing music and would be a lawyer if she did not pursue music.  

Social Activism.
Elle Royal is very passionate about her support of young women. She has marched at several events for women’s causes and supports many female platforms. In addition, Elle founded her own female empowered label whose purpose is to ensure young women's voices are heard and reflected throughout the mainstream. Elle's label pushes for women to take control of their self-image, self-respect and to be more confident and aware of their power in society.

Musical style and influences.
Elle has always gravitated towards 90s hip-hop citing hip-hop’s “<a href="Golden%20Era">Golden Era</a>” as her favorite time in music. She also grew up influenced by 90s R&B and Reggae. Using her raspy delivery, Elle fuses all three styles into a blend she identifies as Reggae Soul. Her rapping style has been compared to that of Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Foxy Brown, Lady Saw, Jay Z, AZ, Max B and Shyne. She is influenced by culture, everyday struggle, and other strong women.

Metropolis of Ancyra

The Metropolis of Ancyra () was a Christian (<a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> after the <a href="East%E2%80%93West%20Schism">East–West Schism</a>) bishopric in Ancyra (modern <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>) and <a href="metropolitan%20see">metropolitan see</a> of <a href="Galatia%20Prima">Galatia Prima</a>. The see survived the <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turkish</a> conquest at the end of the 11th century, and remained active until the end of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and the <a href="population%20exchange%20between%20Greece%20and%20Turkey">population exchange between Greece and Turkey</a> in 1923.

History.
Early Christianity.
The city of <a href="Ancyra">Ancyra</a> had been the political centre of the <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a> of <a href="Galatia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Galatia</a> since its establishment in 25 BC. The arrival of Christianity in Ancyra is probably to be dated to the time of the <a href="Apostles">Apostles</a> in the mid-1st century AD, but is attested in the sources only much later. Modern historians suggest that Apostles <a href="Apostle%20peter">Peter</a> and <a href="Apostle%20Andrew">Andrew</a> in person preached in the city, and founded the local Church, with a certain Cresces, a disciple of the <a href="Apostle%20Paul">Apostle Paul</a>, who lived between 56 and 117 AD, as the city's first bishop. The existence of a Christian Church in Ancyra is not attested until around 180, and the earliest attested bishop, however, is Theodore, who became a <a href="martyr">martyr</a> during one of the anti-Christian persecutions of the 3rd century. Other important early Christian martyrs, who developed a considerable local cult, were <a href="Plato%20of%20Ancyra">Plato of Ancyra</a> and <a href="Clement%20of%20Ancyra">Clement of Ancyra</a>.
The city is well known during the 4th century as a centre of Christian activity: Bishop <a href="Marcellus%20of%20Ancyra">Marcellus of Ancyra</a> and <a href="Basil%20of%20Ancyra">Basil of Ancyra</a> were active in the theological controversies of their day, and the city was the site of no less than three church synods in <a href="Synod%20of%20Ancyra">314</a>, in <a href="Synod%20of%20Ancyra%20%28358%29">358</a>, and in <a href="Synod%20of%20Ancyra%20%28375%29">375</a>, the latter two in favour of <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a>. Emperor <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian</a> () visited the city during his ill-fated Persian campaign in 362, and reportedly ordered the execution of the martyrs Basil and Gemellus; a third condemned, Busiris, was spared his life.

Byzantine period.
When the province of Galatia was divided sometime in 396/99, Ancyra remained the civil capital of Galatia Prima, as well as becoming its ecclesiastical centre (<a href="metropolitan%20see">metropolitan see</a>). Nevertheless, the official titelature of the Metropolitans of Ancyra remained ""<a href="hypertimos">hypertimos</a>" and <a href="exarch">exarch</a> of all Galatia" throughout the see's existence. Its original <a href="suffragan%20sees">suffragan sees</a> in the "<a href="Notitiae%20Episcopatuum">Notitiae Episcopatuum</a>" were <a href="Aspona">Aspona</a>, <a href="Juliopolis">Juliopolis</a>, <a href="Kinna%20%28Galatia%29">Kinna</a>, <a href="Anastasiopolis%20in%20Galatia">Lagania (Anastasiopolis)</a>, <a href="Mnizus">Mnizus</a>, and <a href="Tavium">Tabia</a>. To them were added <a href="Verinopolis">Verinopolis</a> in the 7th century, and <a href="Kalymne">Kalymne</a> in the 9th century. Among the metropolitan sees subject to the <a href="Patriarchate%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarchate of Constantinople</a>, Ancyra occupied a high place, coming fourth after <a href="Caesarea%20in%20Cappadocia">Caesarea in Cappadocia</a>, <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, and <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Heraclea">Heraclea in Thrace</a>. 

Some information about the ecclesiastical affairs of the city during the early 5th century is found in the works of <a href="Palladius%20of%20Galatia">Palladius of Galatia</a> and <a href="Nilus%20of%20Galatia">Nilus of Galatia</a>. Two <a href="convents">convents</a> for women are attested in the 6th century (one dedicated to the <a href="Theotokos">Theotokos</a> Beeia and the Monastery of Petrin), and a male monastery called Attaline is attested in the 7th century. Despite the reduction of the town's size to a small fortified core after the Persian conquest in 622, Ancyra remained an important centre in subsequent centuries, as the capital of the <a href="Opsician%20Theme">Opsician Theme</a> from the mid-7th to the late 8th century, and of the <a href="Bucellarian%20Theme">Bucellarian Theme</a> thereafter.

Under <a href="Constantine%20X%20Doukas">Constantine X Doukas</a> (), the suffragan bishopric of Basilaion (Juliopolis) was raised to metropolitan rank to honour its incumbent, but although the elevation was intended to be temporary, after the latter died, his successors continued to claim metropolitan status. This led to a dispute between Emperor <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> () and Metropolitan Niketas of Ancyra, which ended with Basilaion retaining its new status. Apart from Basilaion/Juliopolis, the sees of Aspona and Verinopolis also appear to have been temporarily lost to Ancyra.

Turkish rule and Ottoman period.
The city fell to the <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turks</a> in the decade after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert</a> (1071), and remained under Turkish rule thereafter, with the exception of a brief period of restored Byzantine control after 1101. The Turkish conquest meant the isolation of Ancyra, at least until the Ottoman period, from the <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and the Patriarchate, and began a prolonged period of decline of the local Christian population. As a result, it is often unclear whether the metropolitans from the 12th century onwards resided in their see; until the early 17th century, there are many documented cases of the administration of the see being given to other metropolises. Nevertheless, the Metropolis of Ancyra continued to exist until the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20population%20exchange">Greco-Turkish population exchange</a> of 1923. 

In the second half of the 12th century the see of Ancyra was temporarily united to that of <a href="Nazianzus">Nazianzus</a>, while in 1173, the patriarchal synod allowed the incumbent metropolitan to transfer to the see of <a href="Kerasus">Kerasus</a>, which was still in Byzantine hands. A Christian population in the city is attested during the reign of <a href="Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos">Andronikos II Palaiologos</a> () in the story of the <a href="neomartyr">neomartyr</a> Niketas, who was <a href="lector">lector</a> at a church in Ancyra. At the same time, however, the sources register complaints that the Metropolitan had abandoned his see, and in 1310/14 the territory of Ancyra was transferred to the <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Gangra">Metropolis of Gangra</a>, while the incumbent received the sees of <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Philippi%2C%20Neapolis%20and%20Thasos">Philippi</a> and <a href="Chrysopolis%20%28Thrace%29">Chrysopolis</a> in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> as compensation. During the second half of the 14th century, the "Notitiae" 19 and 20 record that the Metropolis of Ancyra had been awarded to the <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Thessalonica">Metropolitan of Thessalonica</a>, but in 1395–1406 there was again a Metropolitan of Ancyra, <a href="Macarius%20of%20Ancyra">Macarius</a>, a distinguished theologian who accompanied Emperor <a href="Manuel%20II%20Palaiologos">Manuel II Palaiologos</a> in his voyage to Western Europe. After 1406 Ancyra was again awarded to Gangra, but in 1438 the see is held by the <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Cyzicus">Metropolitan of Cyzicus</a>; a Metropolitan of Ancyra Constantine is attested , but in councils held in Constantinople (now under <a href="Ottoman%20rule">Ottoman rule</a>) in 1471/72 and 1483/84, Ancyra was represented (and possibly again held) by Thessalonica; in between, however, in 1475, an incumbent metropolitan is attested as attending the ordination of Patriarch <a href="Raphael%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Raphael I of Constantinople</a>. The situation is further confused by the reference to an active metropolis in patriarchal ordinances of 1483 and 1525. The situation is clearer beginning with the metropolitanate of Parthenius (1602–1631), who appears to have resided in his see, and engaged himself in trying to restore its flock and finances, that had suffered greatly as a result of the <a href="Celali%20rebellions">Celali rebellions</a> in the previous decades. Parthenius' successors were most likely likewise residents of Ankara. However, accurate information on the incumbents is only available from the middle of the 19th century on. 

The local Christian population declined quickly during the first centuries after the Turkish conquest. In the Ottoman tax registers of 1488/89, in the entirety of the <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Ankara">Sanjak of Ankara</a>, a total of 822 households owing the "<a href="jizya">jizya</a>" (the per capital tax on non-Muslims) are recorded. In 1522, the number of Christian households is estimated at 277, and the respective population at 1,500, as against 15,000 Muslims and around 200 Jews. The registers also indicate that Armenian names, and hence followers of the <a href="Armenian%20Church">Armenian Church</a>, predominated among the local Christian population. The existence of Greek Orthodox population alongside Armenians and Jews is confirmed by the German traveller Dernschwam in 1553. This reflects a situation that was still apparent in the 1880s, when the French ethnologist Vital Cuinet estimated the Christian population of the <a href="Ankara%20Vilayet">Ankara Vilayet</a> at 34,009 <a href="Greek%20Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a>, 83,063 Armenians of the Armenian Church, and smaller Armenian Catholic and Protestant communities. The numerical weakness of the flock was one reason for the frequent absence of a residential Metropolitan in the 15th–16th centuries. More importantly, the Christian population that remained was dispersed and isolated in small communities, with low social, educational, and financial standing, who suffered further decline during the Celali rebellions. In order to counterbalance this, on the suggestion of Metropolitan Parthenius, in 1610 a number of towns (Tilhissar, <a href="%C4%B0nebolu">İnebolu</a>, and <a href="Tosya">Tosya</a>) were transferred from the Metropolis of Gangra; the latter never acquiesced to this, however, and within the next few decades secured their return.
The Metropolis of Ancyra retained its traditional high rank among the metropolises of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, at least until 1715, when it is still recorded in the fourth place in the "Syntagmation" of <a href="Chrysanthos%20of%20Jerusalem">Chrysanthos of Jerusalem</a>. In the list of Patriarch <a href="Seraphim%20II%20of%20Constantinople">Seraphim II of Constantinople</a> in 1759, however, it was demoted to 31st place; it fell further to 32nd by 1855, but rose again to 29th by 1901. Nevertheless, the same period saw a considerable turnaround in the fortunes of the local Greek population. The powerful <a href="%C3%87apanoglu">Çapanoglu</a> family restored order and prosperity in the area in the 18th century, and the upturn in trade benefited the local Christian population, which was also increased by the immigration of <a href="Cappadocian%20Greeks">Cappadocian Greeks</a> from the area of Caesarea (<a href="Kayseri">Kayseri</a>) and of <a href="Pontic%20Greeks">Pontic Greeks</a>, seeking employment in the <a href="Ak%20Da%C4%9F">Ak Dağ</a> mines. As a result of the Cappadocian immigration, however, it is likely that the Orthodox of the sanjaks of <a href="Yozgat">Yozgat</a>, <a href="%C3%87orum">Çorum</a> and <a href="Kir%C5%9Fehir">Kirşehir</a>, which along with the Sanjak of Ankara constituted the Ankara Vilayet, were under the jurisdiction of the <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Caesarea">Metropolis of Caesarea</a> rather than Ancyra. 

In the late 19th century, the Metropolis of Ancyra comprised the Sanjak of Ankara in the Ankara Vilayet and the "<a href="kaza">kaza</a>s" of <a href="K%C3%BCtahya">Kütahya</a> and <a href="Eskisehir">Eskisehir</a> in the <a href="H%C3%BCdavendig%C3%A2r%20Vilayet">Hüdavendigâr Vilayet</a>. Its actual size however was even smaller, as Orthodox communities resided only in eight settlements: Ankara, the town of Haymana, and the villages of Dikmen and Köceren in the Sanjak of Ankara, and Kütahya, Eskisehir, and the villages of İspir and Köçoğlu near the latter. At the beginning of the 20th century, the annual income of the metropolis was estimated at 200,000 <a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20piastre">piastres</a>, and according to the registers of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, comprised a flock of 10,598 in 1913/14, of which 2,251 in Ankara (up from 1,637 in 1881), 4,398 in Kütahya (4,050 in the 1880s), 407 in Haymana (23 in 1881), 2,952 or 1,941 in Eskisehir (1,147 in the 1880s), and the rest in the smaller settlements. This reflects the important role played to the metropolis' numerical strength by the communities further west, around Kütahya and Eskisehir, which had been incorporated into it at some unknown point. The Metropolis of Ancyra still remained one of the smaller metropolises in Asia Minor during the late Ottoman period; only the metropolises of <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Kydoniae">Kydoniai</a> were smaller still. The local Christians were mostly Turcophone (<a href="Karamanlides">Karamanlides</a>). Only the higher clergy, government officials, and headmasters of schools were Greek-speakers. At the same time, however, there was no presence of Catholic converts among the local Greek population, although the foundation of Greek schools in the 1870s and 1880s increased the knowledge of Greek.

Following the population exchange, and the departure of all Christians in the region, the last incumbent, Metropolitan Constantine (1922–1934), resided in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>.

Resurrection (documentary)

Resurrection is a 2016 documentary film by <a href="Eugenio%20Polgovsky">Eugenio Polgovsky</a> about the extremely polluted environment around the waterfall of <a href="El%20Salto%20de%20Juanacatl%C3%A1n">El Salto de Juanacatlán</a>, in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>.

Synopsis.
The place that used to be known as the "Mexican Niagara", a natural paradise shaped by the <a href="Grande_de_Santiago_River">Santiago river</a> and the waterfall of "El Salto de Juanacatlán" is now a poisonous place for the community that lives in its bank. With the establishment of an industrial corridor near the city of <a href="Guadalajara">Guadalajara</a> in the 70's, the waters became toxic and destructive. Today the Santiago river is one of the most polluted ones in Mexico. While authorities keep ignoring the problem and locals are dying silently and suffering from diseases like cancer, renal insufficiency, skin diseases and infections among other health problems, Polgovsky focuses on a local family that fights to survive in the ruins of their town.

Release.
Resurrection had its international premiere at the 33th edition of FIFE (Paris International Environmental Film Festival) where it won the Special Jury Award. In Mexico, the film was screened in the Guanajuato International Film Festival and the Morelia International Film Festival where it received the Ambulante Special Award in the Mexican Feature-Length Documentary section.

Althea (1801 ship)

Althea was launched at Calcutta in 1801. She made one voyage to Britain for the British <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>. The French captured her in the Indian Ocean in in 1804 and then kept her at <a href="Isle%20de%20France%20%28Mauritius%29">Île de France</a> where she served as a prison ship. When the British captured Île de France in 1810 they recovered "Althea". (However, it is probable that they recovered her in between, and lost her again.) She then resumed her mercantile career until she wrecked in 1812.

Career.
Captain Arundel Roberts sailed "Althea" from Calcutta on 24 January 1802, bound for London. She passed <a href="Sagar%20Island">Saugor</a> on 15 April and reached <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> on 24 July. "Althea" arrived at Deptford on 15 October.

"Althea" was admitted to the Registry of Great Britain on 25 November 1802.

Capture (1804) and recapture (1810).
On 6 April 1804 "Althea", which was coming from Bengal, was near Ceylon when she parted from her convoy in a gale. On 17 April the French frigates and captured "Althea" in the Indian Ocean (). Captain Miller engaged "Atalante", which came up first, but when "Belle Poule" came up on hsi other side he decided to <a href="striking%20the%20colours">strike</a>. One problem Miller faced was that the frigates were firing their long 18-pounder guns from a range that "Althea"s <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s could not reach. Althea reached Port Napoleon, Île de France, on 8 May. She and her cargo were immediately condemned in prize.

"Althea" had been insured for £400,000. "Althea" was sailing under charter to the EIC, which valued the cargo it lost at £6,698. 

In a process that is currently obscure, the British appear to have recovered "Althea". In March 1806, Captain William Richardson, in "Althea", took on water at <a href="Tioman%20Island">Pulo Timoan</a>, and also took a number of navigational bearings. (). On 20 July as "Althea" was returning to Bengal from China, she was pushed towards the Matelotas (). In August she was at <a href="Selayar%20Islands">Salayer Island</a>. In April 1807, as "Althea" was sailing from <a href="British%20Bencoolen">Bencoolen</a> to Bengal, the Portuguese cook killed a "mussulman boy, of about five or six years of age, by running an iron instrument" up the boy's rectum. The court acquitted the cook of murder, but convicted him of manslaughter. Between August and October 1807, privateers from Mauritius captured "Althea", "Gilwell", "Elizabeth", "Trafalgar", "Mangles", "Susanna", "Caroline", "Succedany", "Maria", "Eliza", "Udny", "Highland Chief", "Resource", "Louisa", and "Mersosa". The prizes were worth about 3 million rupees. "Lloyd's List" reported on 16 April 1808 that the country ships "Eliza", Resources", Gilwell", "Loi'a", and "Althea" had been taken in the Bay of Bengal. On 1 November 1807 at <a href="Port%20Louis">Port Napoleon</a>, Richardson, C. Bean, late master of "Gilwell", R. Dickie, late master of "Elizabeth", and some others wrote a letter to <a href="L%C3%A9onard-Bernard%20Motard">Léonard Motard</a>, captain of , for his kind and courteous treatment of them while they were his prisoners.

This would suggest tha tit was "Sémillante", rather than a privateer, that captured "Althea" and Richardson. "Althea" was then laid up at Mauritius as a prison ship.

On 3 December 1810 the British <a href="Invasion%20of%20Isle%20de%20France">captured Île de France</a>. Among the vessels the Royal Navy found at Port Napoleon was "L'Althea, of 1000 Tons".

Fate.
"Althea" was lost upon Fultah Point, on the <a href="Hooghli%20River">Hooghli River</a>, in July 1812.

Victor Andres Garcia Belaunde Velarde

Victor Andrés García-Belaunde Velarde (born 1977) is a Peruvian educator, psychologist and ethicist. He is a prominent advocate for secular rationalism in Peru, an otherwise highly traditional and religious country, and is active across various media. He currently leads the "Manzana Escéptica", a program for the popularization of science in La Mula TV, and is a panelist on Guía Escéptica, Peru’s first podcast on skepticism, rationality and science. He is a professor at San Ignacio de Loyola University and at Universidad Científica del Sur in Lima, Peru, where he researches and teaches in Ethics, Philosophy of Science, Epistemology and Theory of Science, and Deontology, respectively.

Education

García-Belaunde graduated Cum Laude in Psychology from Universidad de Lima. He obtained two Masters, the first in History of Philosophy at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, and the second in Professional and Applied Ethics at the Australian National University, where he graduated with Distinction for his thesis on the moral viability of genetic engineering in humans.

Other notable public activities

Garcia-Belaunde is co-founder and executive director of the Secular Humanist Society of Peru. He has also published several articles on human nature and science communication from a psychological and philosophical perspective. He has been a panelist on educational programs for Radio Union, Radio Miraflores and RPP. Previously, he was a regular panelist on Radio Canto Grande 'Para-normales de la noche', the first radio program to raise awareness of skepticism in Peru. 

He was awarded with the Go Harlem Brudtland Award for his work on "Manzana Escéptica", which deals with the discussion of ideas considered to be true for most, but false for science.

He also has published the book "Crítica de las interacciones del alma: Una aproximación aristotélica y cartesiana a partir de la ciencia normal" in which criticizes the animistic explanations of Aristotelian hilmorphism and the Cartesian dualism from a naturalistic perspective. In the first chapter he explores the Aristotelian writings on the soul and the Aristotelian interactions of the soul with matter. In the second chapter he contrasts the functioning of the Aristotelian agent and patient intellect with the findings of cognitive psychology and cybernetic systems. In the third chapter he examines the Aristotelian postulates about incontinence and then addresses the problems concerning power and action in moral decisions. The fourth chapter deals with the Cartesian interactions of the soul with the body. There the validity of the relations between the soul, the passions and the animal spirits will be questioned. The fifth chapter maintains that it is not necessary to create an immaterial entity to explain the psychic phenomena. It also discusses body-body interactions, eliminating the intermediate entity (soul). Finally, he briefly recounts the evolution of material interactions (body-body) to consciousness according to normal science

Madeline Jones Procter

Madeline Jane Jones Procter, (January 10, 1894, <a href="Bethlehem%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</a> – May 7, 1975, <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>) was the sole assistant to <a href="Anna%20Jarvis">Anna Jarvis</a>, the founder of the <a href="Mother%E2%80%99s%20Day">Mother’s Day</a> holiday in the United States.

Early life and family background.
Madeline Jane Jones was born to William Henry Jones, III and Clara Elizabeth Burkhardt Jones on January 10, 1894 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Madeline had one brother, Ben Jr. The family moved to Philadelphia where Madeline met Anna Jarvis in 1909(1).

Movement towards Mother’s Day.
In 1909, Madeline applied for a secretarial job at Quaker Cab Company, which was owned by Anna Jarvis’s brother, Claude Jarvis. (1)(2)
“He wasn’t in so Anna came out to see what I wanted. It was the day before 
Mother’s Day. She told me she liked my looks and wanted me to work for her instead of working for her brother. She handed me a washtub of red and white carnations and she took one. The carnations were chosen because it was inexpensive-only 3 cents in those days. We went out on the street corner of 13th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia and gave them out, urging people to wear a red carnation if their mother was living and a white carnation if she was not and to write their mothers even if she lived in the same town.” (2) Madeline Jones and Anna Jarvis distributed the carnations free of charge to anyone who would take one. (1)(3) Madeline left school to become Anna Jarvis’s constant companion and sole co-worker and assisted Anna in letter writing and phone calls to civic groups, governors, legislators, ministers, editors, businessmen and every type of organization imaginable. They also planned celebrations to honor mothers throughout the country. (2)(9) Their chief goal was for everyone to write his or her mother for mother’s day and to wear a carnation. (2) 
At first Madeline and Anna were met with as much ridicule as acceptance,
but they never gave up their cause taking their campaign to other metropolitan cities including New York, Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco. (1) (3)
In 1912, West Virginia made Mother’s Day a statewide holiday. Pennsylvania followed suit the next year. (2)
Also in 1912 a delegate from Andrews <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in <a href="Grafton%2C%20West%20Virginia">Grafton, West Virginia</a> introduced a resolution recognizing Anna Jarvis as the founder of Mother’s Day and the second Sunday in May was designated at Mother’s Day in the church at the General Conference meeting in Minneapolis, Minn.(2)(4)
The two tireless workers rallied enough support to inspire <a href="President%20Woodrow%20Wilson">President Woodrow Wilson</a> to sign a joint resolution lauding mothers as “the greatest source of the country’s strength and inspiration. (3)(5) 
President Wilson then declared the second Sunday in May as the official day for honoring mothers. (1)
Mother’s Day was officially established as an American holiday in 1914. (1)(2)
The President’s proclamation was the culmination of years of crusading on the part of Anna Jarvis and Madeline Jones.

Commercialization.
It did not take long after President Wilson’s decree for mother’s day to become commercialized. People bought fancy cards instead of writing letters and florists made profits over the flowers that marked the day. (7)
Anna Jarvis grew bitter. (8) She deplored any form of commercialization of the holiday. (6) 
“What Miss Jarvis had in mind was a handwritten love letter to your mother, not the printed card.” (2) Madeline recalled seeing a “Mother’s Day Cocktail” soon after the holiday was proclaimed and said that“once we went into Wannamaker’s tea room and found a Mother’s Day Salad on the menu. Anna ordered it and when it came, she dumped it on the table and walked out.” (2)(7)(1) “Not long before Jarvis died in 1948, Jarvis complained to a reporter, “I wish I had never started the whole damn thing”. (2) 
Anna Jarvis died an embittered woman because of the commercial turn Mother’s Day had taken. (1) She also died penniless because she spent her money campaigning for Mother’s Day. 
Mother’s Day Concept
Although the two women remained close lifelong friends, their lives hardly paralleled. Anna Jarvis came to condemn Mother’s Day for the commercialism it produced and died penniless, childless and bitter.(5) Madeline Jones tolerated its commercial success. “It is the thought that counts” and if the thought includes a gift, why that’s all right, too.”(7)
Madeline Jones remained faithful to the holiday’s concept and led an abundant life blessed with many descendants.(9) 
“The world has changed. I don’t object to cards and gifts. Mother’s like to get gifts and children hate to write.”(2) My son was at <a href="Virginia%20Episcopal%20School">Virginia Episcopal School</a>, he use to send me red roses on Mother’s Day. Then I’d get the bill. But I didn’t mind because I knew he didn’t have any money.”(1)

Life-long companions.
In 1919. Madeline reluctantly parted company with Anna when she married Dr. Ivan M. Procter, a Marine Officer in the Medical Corps in WWII. (8) 
Madeline moved with her husband to his native home, Raleigh, North Carolina, where he set up his private practice and became North Carolina’s first board certified obstetrician and gynecologist and the first to use radium in the treatment of cervical cancer.(5) 
Madeline’s marriage and move to North Carolina was not the end of her devotion to Miss Jarvis or the idea of Mother’s Day.(1) Madeline had four children to whom they recall her as “a wonderful mother”.(9) She named her oldest son, Reginald Jarvis, for Anna Jarvis’ only brother. Her second daughter was born on Mother’s day in 1929. Her daughter wasn’t due for more than two weeks but Madeline took castor oil to induce labor on that day. (5) Her four children, are Reginald Jarvis, named for Anna Jarvis’s only brother, Doris, Marriott, born on Mother’s Day and Nancy.(1) Every year Madeline visited all her children’s schools to tell the story about the celebrations’ founding.(1)

Family life.
Madeline’s Cameron Park home in Raleigh was a comfortable place for her four children and sixteen grand children. She was fun loving and related well to her grandchildren and their friends “who absolutely adored her”. (7) 
.Madeline cooked a Sunday feast for her entire family every week until three years before she died. (8) She was always “ soft spoken and somewhat sentimental and was especially fond of small children, birds, flowers. (7) She was firm on her ideas on child-rearing”. (7) Several of her grand children wrote a poem labeling their grandmother “ A great and groovy grandma with rebellion in her heart”. (5) Her daughter Marriott wrote a poem calling her mother “ a giver, a doer, an angel, a saint, whose laughter rings clearly, but never complaint.” “My mother was such a loving person and so uncritical. She loved the day and always saw something beautiful in it. Our friends adored her. She was the original ‘hippy’ and never put on airs-she was very down to earth”. (1) Madeline was an intuitive person. She was an unusual woman who was more connected to God not to have been a church person than anyone I’ve ever known. Her relationship with Him was personal and complete”(7).
When Madeline died more than 100 teenagers showed up at the graveside at the historical Oakwood Cemetery which was a real statement of the love they felt for her (7). On her tombstone her children had these words carved “She Blessed Us”.

Mothering.
Madeline was long on love and short on discipline. She was “so totally family-oriented. That is why Mother’s Day was important to her…but every day was Mother’s Day to her.”(7)
“If Madeline were alive today, she would still be urging people to write letters to their mom. She would tell us not to worry about the housework and go out and have a good time because the housework will be here when you get back. Enjoy your children. Go take them to the park. Go take them to feed the ducks. Don’t worry about cleaning out the closet”. (7)
Madeline’s Mother

Madeline remembered her own mother as “the most wonderful person in the world”(1) “Though she was paralyzed and bedridden the last six years of her life, she was always thinking of others. She gave her wheelchair away to a crippled woman who lived across the street. She sang all the time and was always sorry for everybody else.” (1)

L. Fidelia Woolley Gillette

Reverend Lucia Fidelia Woolley Gillette (April 8, 1827 – October 14, 1905) was among the first women ordained Universalist minister in the United States and the first woman ordained of any denomination in Canada.

Early life.
Lucia Fidelia Woolley was born in <a href="Nelson%2C%20New%20York">Nelson, New York</a>, on April 8, 1827. She was the daughter of Rev. Edward Mott Woolley and Laura Smith, and the oldest of a family of seven children. Her ancestry was English and French.

When Woolley was still a child the family moved often in the New York State: on her grandparents' farm in <a href="Cazenovia%2C%20New%20York">Cazenovia, New York</a>, in <a href="Munnsville%2C%20New%20York">Munnsville, New York</a>, where her father opened a leather shop, and in 1841 in <a href="Bridgewater%2C%20New%20York">Bridgewater, New York</a>, where her father was an Universalist minister.

Woolley was an extremely timid and sensitive child, but an enthusiast about her studies. Her father expected her, when she was a mere girl, to read books upon abstruse subjects and to be able to talk about them with himself and his friends, but the distinguishing characteristic of her childhood was spontaneous sympathy for every living thing and all her life it had made her the helper of the helpless and the friend "of such as are in bunds".

Woolley attended the <a href="Cazenovia%20Seminary">Cazenovia Seminary</a> and the Bridgewater Academy.

Career.
L. Fidelia Woolley Gillette's literary work started when she was 16 years old under the pen-names "Lyra" and "Carrie Russell", "Ruth Dinsmore" and her own name. Her poems and prose articles appeared in various papers and magazines.

In 1847, Woolley's father moved to a small farm near <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Michigan">Birmingham, Michigan</a>, ministering at Pontiac and Birmingham, and Wolley took a teaching position.

On August 21, 1873, Gillette obtained a license to preach and was ordained in 1877. She was among the first women ordained Universalist minister, <a href="Augusta%20Jane%20Chapin">Augusta Jane Chapin</a> being the first on December 7, 1864, in <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing, Michigan</a>. In 1888 Gillette was the first woman ordained to preach of any denomination in Canada: she was ministering at the Universalist Church of Bloomfield, <a href="Prince%20Edward%20County%2C%20Ontario">Prince Edward County, Ontario</a>.

Gillette's published works are: "Pebbles From the Shore" (1879), "Floating Leaves" (1881), "Editorials and Other Waifs" (1889) and a memoir of her father, "Memoir of Rev. Edward Mott Woolley" (1855), who was a popular minister in the Universalist Church. There was a faint suggestion of the dramatic in Gillette's style of speaking that gave it charm; the elegance of her language, the richness of her imagery, the striking and original character of her illustrations was as refreshing as they were entertaining.

Gillette's missionary and pastoral work lasted several years. She wrote hymns, like: "Be True, Boys!", "The Beautiful World", "Come to My Kingdom", "I Will Not Forget, Our Father Is True" and "Jesus Leads Me Every Day".

Gillette lectured on women's issues, religious and literary issues, and campaigned for woman's suffrage. Gillette's lectures received high praise. In 1874 Gillette was selected to represent the Michigan State Woman Suffrage Association in Lansing. In October 1874, Gillette opened and closed the 6th annual meeting of the National Woman Suffrage Association in Detroit. She was the women's rights editor for the Rochester Era.

Personal life.
On December 23, 1850, Fidelia Woolley married Hartson Gillette (1816–1886) and they had one daughter, Florence Lillian Gillette Flett (1851–1900), actress, dramatist and poet.

In the 1860s, Gillette moved with her family to <a href="Rochester%2C%20Michigan">Rochester, Michigan</a>, where her husband ran the Rochester mill. In February 1864 Hartson Gillette enlisted in the <a href="22nd%20Michigan%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">22nd Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>. In Rochester, Gillette helped founding the Rochester Woman's Club.

In 1873, Gillette's daughter, Florence, joined a theater company based in Chicago and later married Eugene Russell Soggs, an actor, on February 25, 1875. She married again, on July 9, 1889, to George A. Flett, a bookkeeper, and actor. She died on June 10, 1900, after five years of <a href="paresis">paresis</a>, and her dying wish was to be buried in Southern California, which her mother accomplished: she is buried at Pomona, California. Florence Gillette was a protege of <a href="Charlotte%20Saunders%20Cushman">Charlotte Saunders Cushman</a> and co-worker of <a href="George%20Vanderhof">George Vanderhof</a> and <a href="Edwin%20Booth">Edwin Booth</a>.

This list is based on one published by the National Park Service (NPS). As of November 2011, the checklist contained 387 species. Since the NPS list was published, seven species have been added through eBird.

This list is presented in the <a href="taxonomic%20sequence">taxonomic sequence</a> of the "Check-list of North American Birds", 7th edition through the 58th Supplement, published by the <a href="American%20Ornithological%20Society">American Ornithological Society</a> (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the "Check-list".

This list contains 394 species. Unless otherwise noted, all are considered to occur regularly in Channel Islands National Park as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. The tags below are used to designate the abundance of some species. The NPS checklist reports abundance separately for each island; here the tag for maximum abundance is used even if a species is less abundant on some islands.

<doc id="54830228" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54830228" title="Greenwich Judgement">
Greenwich Judgement

The Greenwich Judgement of 1990 declared as unlawful a decision by Greenwich <a href="Local%20Education%20Authority">Local Education Authority</a> (LEA) to give priority in school admissions to its own residents over residents from neighbouring LEAs, clarifying that applicants must be treated equally, whether they reside inside or outside the authority. Greenwich's policy on admissions had been formed in the context of the dissolution of the <a href="Inner%20London%20Education%20Authority">Inner London Education Authority</a>, and was similar to established LEA policies used in other parts of the country. However, following complaints from parents and school leaders in neighbouring Lewisham, the policy was judged to be in breach of section 6(5) of the <a href="Education_Act%23United_Kingdom">Education Act 1980</a>. This set a precedent in UK law, establishing that <a href="state%20school">maintained schools</a> may not give admissions priority to children for the sole reason that they live within the LEA's administrative boundaries. The judgement was later codified in section 86(8)(a) of the <a href="School%20Standards%20and%20Framework%20Act%201998">School Standards and Framework Act 1998</a> and also in the National Admissions Code. 

The Greenwich Judgement has been associated with a decline in the use of <a href="Catchment%20area">catchment areas</a> as a means of managing school admissions, and an associated increase in cross-border mobility. 

The Rotherham Judgement (1997) later established that the principle of admission authorities operating catchment areas as part of their over-subscription criteria in allocating school places was lawful provided that in so doing authorities are not in breach of the Greenwich judgement. Parental preference was confirmed to have primacy, so that applicants from outside of a school's catchment area, who express a preference for that school, should be prioritised over applicants within the catchment area who express no preference. 

Despite the Greenwich Judgement, catchment areas can be wholly contained within administrative boundaries, and even coincide with administrative boundaries, provided the area is clearly defined and there is some additional justification for the choice of area that is considered reasonable, such as distance from the school or ease of access. It is common for catchment area boundaries to be aligned with well defined geographical features such as postcode areas and roads, and these sometimes coincide with administrative boundaries. Some <a href="faith%20schools">faith schools</a> have catchment areas that are aligned with diocesan boundaries or deaneries which follow the Local Authority's boundaries, and these have been deemed not in breach of the Greenwich Judgement provided that faith criteria are also applied. Some <a href="Grammar%20schools">Grammar schools</a> also align their catchments with administrative boundaries. Catchment area boundaries, in common with other over-subscription criteria used in admissions policies, must not unfairly disadvantage children from particular social or racial groups.

Opposition.
Some Local Authorities have found that the increase in cross-border movement associated with the Greenwich Judgement makes it more difficult for them to fulfil their statutory duty to ensure all children within their area are offered a school place. It also removed from LEAs one means of helping local families to secure places at local schools of their choice. The <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a> have attempted to persuade the UK Parliament that the Greenwich Judgement should be repealed, due to perceived negative effects on school admissions patterns in some Local Authorities. The Royal London Borough of Kingston upon Thames has also attempted to overturn the judgement via the Local Government Association. Bromley LEA challenged the Greenwich judgement in the High Court and House of Lords but was unsuccessful.

Laure Gaudreault

Laure Gaudreault (October 25, 1889–January 19, 1975) was a Canadian teacher, <a href="Trade%20union">trade unionist</a>, and journalist. She worked to improve working conditions and wages, and later, retirement rights, for rural women teachers.

Biography.
Laure Gaudreault was born on October 25, 1889 in <a href="La%20Malbaie">La Malbaie</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, Canada. Her mother educated her at home, and when she was 15 years old she earned her teaching certificate. The next year, she attended l'École Normale Laval in Quebec City. Gaudreault began teaching at the <a href="One-room%20school">country schools</a> in <a href="Charlevoix">Charlevoix</a> when she was 16. After a few years of teaching, she joined the <a href="Ursulines%20of%20Quebec">Ursulines of Quebec</a>, but left two years after joining because of health problems. Before returning to teaching, she began writing for the local publications about subjects including poor working conditions for rural female educators.

In 1936, Gaudreault returned to teaching, and noticed that conditions hadn't changed. This same year, the government issued a <a href="Incomes%20policy">wage freeze</a> for rural teachers. Gaudreault organized the other teachers in her region to form its first teacher's union, the Association des institutrices rurales de la province de Québec (Association of Rural Teachers of the Province of Quebec). Over the next year, over thirteen regional women's teachers unions were created. In 1937 she created the Fédération des institutrices rurales de la province de Québec (Federation of Rural Teachers of the Province of Quebec), and delegates from the regional teacher's unions appointed her as president. This made her the first paid secular trade unionist in Quebec. To ensure the regional associations would communicate, she created "La Petite feuille", a periodical that continued to be published for nine years. After nine years, the Federation of Rural Teachers was replaced by the Corporation des instituteurs et institutrices de la province de Québec (Corporation of Teachers of the Province of Quebec), and "La Petite feuille" was replaced by a publication titled "l'Enseignement". In 1945, the Federation succeeded in achieving an annual minimum wage of $600 for teachers. This was increased to $1,500 in 1959.

In 1945, Gaudreault helped to create the Corporation générale des instituteurs et institutrices de la province de Québec (General Corporation of Teachers of the Province of Quebec), a group that combined the teacher's unions in the region.

In 1961, Gaudreault turned her focus to retirement rights for rural teachers and created the Association des instituteurs et institutrices catholiques retraités du Québec (Quebec Association of Retired Catholic Teachers), which later became AREQ (Association des retraitées et retraités de l'enseignement du Québec; the Association of Retired Teachers of Quebec). Gaudreault worked until her retirement in 1974. She died in January 19, 1975 in <a href="Clermont%2C%20Quebec%20%28township%29">Clermont</a>, Quebec.

I was convinced that anyone who saw me would instantly know that I was on my way to the office of Dr. Sigmund Freud – on a mission that would hardly have pleased the Nazis."

Birmingham Banking Company

The Birmingham Banking Company operated in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20West%20Midlands">Birmingham, West Midlands</a> from 1829 to 1889, and as The Metropolitan and Birmingham Bank from 1889 to 1892, the Metropolitan, Birmingham and South Wales Bank from 1892 to 1893, and the Metropolitan Bank (of England and Wales) from 1893 to 1914.

History.
This joint-stock bank was established on 30 September 1829 in Birmingham. It was based upon the business of the Birmingham private bankers Gibbins & Lovell, established in 1825 by Joseph Gibbins and Edward Bourne Lovell, and initially traded from their premises in New Street. The bank built itself a headquarters in Birmingham at the junction of Waterloo Street and <a href="Bennetts%20Hill">Bennetts Hill</a> which was constructed in 1830 to the designs of the architects <a href="Thomas%20Rickman">Thomas Rickman</a> and <a href="Henry%20Hutchinson">Henry Hutchinson</a>. They moved into this new building in 1831. It was altered in 1868 by <a href="Yeoville%20Thomason">Yeoville Thomason</a>.

The firm grew rapidly and by the mid 1830s it was one of Birmingham's strongest banks.

During the <a href="Panic%20of%201866">financial crisis of 1866</a> the bank suffered severe liquidity problems and failed on 14 July 1866 with liabilities of £1.8m () against a capital of £280,000 (). It was the largest bank to fail during the banking crisis of the mid 1860s. It was restructured and reopened in August 1866.

It amalgamated with the Royal Exchange Bank (formerly the Metropolitan Bank) in 1889 to form The Metropolitan and Birmingham Bank. This amalgamation enabled the Birmingham company to facilitate its London business as the Royal Exchange Bank had a seat in the clearing house, and until this time the Birmingham bank had paid fees of several thousand pounds a year for cashing their cheques in the <a href="London%20Clearing%20House">London Clearing House</a>. The nominal capital of the bank increased at this time from £3.5m to £5.0m (equivalent to £ million in ).

On the acquisition of the South Wales Union in 1892 in was renamed the Metropolitan, Birmingham and South Wales Bank and on the acquisition of the National Bank of Wales in 1893 it changed its name again to the Metropolitan Bank (of England and Wales).

The Metropolitan Bank (of England and Wales) was acquired by the <a href="Midland%20Bank">Midland Bank</a> in 1914. The branch on <a href="Bennetts%20Hill">Bennetts Hill</a> closed in 2002.

Elizabeth Bender Roe Cloud

Elizabeth Bender Roe Cloud (April 2, 1887–September 16, 1965) was an <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a> activist and educator. A product of the Native American Boarding School System, she graduated with teaching credentials from the <a href="Hampton%20Institute">Hampton Institute</a> and taught from 1908 though 1916. She then joined her husband and helped administer the American Indian Institute of Wichita, Kansas for twenty-five years. In the 1940s, she founded the Oregon Trails Women's Club with tribe members from the <a href="Umatilla%20Indian%20Reservation">Umatilla Indian Reservation</a>. She served as the National Chair of Indian Welfare for the <a href="General%20Federation%20of%20Women%27s%20Clubs">General Federation of Women's Clubs</a> for eight years, the first American Indian to hold the post. Roe Cloud received the National Mother of the Year award in 1950 and in 1952, she was honored as the "Outstanding Indian" of the year by the <a href="American%20Indian%20Exposition">American Indian Exposition</a> of <a href="Anadarko%2C%20Oklahoma">Anadarko, Oklahoma</a>. She is noted for having used her influence as an educated indigenous woman to advocate for Native American self-determination.

Early life.
Elizabeth Georgiana Bender (native name: Equay Zaince) was born on April 2, 1887 on the <a href="White%20Earth%20Indian%20Reservation">White Earth Indian Reservation</a> in northwestern <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> to Pay show de o quay (Mary née Razor or Razier), of the Mississippi Chippewa band and Albertus Bliss Bender, a German immigrant. Her father was a logger and after he and Mary married, he lived on her allotment, continued to log, and also hunted and fished. Bender's mother was an <a href="herbalist">herbalist</a> and healer, who served as a <a href="midwife">midwife</a> to her tribe. One of eleven children born to the couple, Elizabeth was the sixth child and one of five who attended Hampton Institute. Her older sister Anna was also an educator and two of her older brothers John and <a href="Chief%20Bender">Charles Albert "Chief" Bender</a> were noted baseball players. Chief was inducted into the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1953. 

Bender attended boarding schools in Minnesota, beginning her studies at around age nine at the Catholic Sisters School in <a href="St.%20Joseph%2C%20Minnesota">St. Joseph, Minnesota</a>. After her first year, she transferred to the Catholic Sisters School closer to home, in <a href="White%20Earth%2C%20Minnesota">White Earth</a>, for another year. Between 1898 and 1902, she took courses at the <a href="American%20Indian%20boarding%20schools">Pipestone Boarding School</a> for half a day and then performed manual labor for the other half-day. She went on to join her sister Anna and further her education at the <a href="normal%20school">normal school</a> of the Hampton Institute in 1903. Both she and her sister Anna participated in the work-away summer programs, where they were paid for performing domestic services. In 1904, they were placed in separate houses near Boston, which allowed them to spend time together, as well as making a trip to watch their brother Chief play baseball. Completing her studies in 1907, she remained at Hampton taking post-graduate courses in teaching and domestic science.

Career.
In 1908, Bender was sent to the <a href="Blackfeet%20Reservation">Blackfeet Reservation</a> in <a href="Browning%2C%20Montana">Browning, Montana</a>, where she would teach for two years. In 1910, she returned east and completed a nursing course in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> at <a href="Hahnemann%20University%20Hospital">Hahnemann Hospital</a>. In 1912, she returned to the Blackfeet Reservation. The following year, she moved on to the school at the <a href="Fort%20Belknap%20Indian%20Reservation">Fort Belknap Indian Reservation</a> in Montana, where she remained until 1914. At both of the reservations, she not only taught, but served as housemother to the boarders, occasionally as their cook, and even treated the students for <a href="trachoma">trachoma</a>. She returned to Hampton to complete a <a href="Home%20Economics">Home Economics</a> course in 1914 and 1915. During this same time frame, she attended the Fourth Annual Conference of the <a href="Society%20of%20American%20Indians">Society of American Indians</a> held between October 6 and 11, 1914 in <a href="Madison%2C%20Wisconsin">Madison, Wisconsin</a>. Bender had joined the organization when she graduated and it was at this meeting that she would meet <a href="Henry%20Roe%20Cloud">Henry Roe Cloud</a>, a full-blood <a href="Winnebago%20Tribe%20of%20Nebraska">Winnebago</a> tribe member. The two immediately began a relationship, which continued even after Bender finished her studies at Hampton and went to teach at <a href="Carlisle%20Indian%20Industrial%20School">Carlisle Indian Industrial School</a> in 1915. Simultaneously, Roe Cloud went to <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a> and founded the Roe Institute, later known as the American Indian Institute, a college preparatory school for indigenous men. While she was at Carlisle, Bender formed a <a href="Camp%20Fire%20Girls">Camp Fire Girls</a> program, to help girls learn domestic and artistic skills. On 12 June, 1916, Bender married Roe Cloud at her brother Chief's home in Philadelphia.

The couple made their home in Wichita, where Elizabeth worked at the American Indian Institute (AII), serving as matron and financial manager. Because Henry had no prior experience teaching, she often served as an advisor and took an active part in running the school for twenty years. Unlike other Native American schools, the curriculum of AII included courses on indigenous cultures, in addition to the academic lessons. Over the next several years, their family grew to include Elizabeth Marion (born 1917), Anne Woesha (born 1918), Lillian Alberta (born 1920), Ramona Clark (born 1922) and Henry Jr. (1926-1929). When Henry Jr. died, they adopted Jay Hunter, a family friend, who was not orphaned, but joined their family as was customary among the Winnebago. In 1931, Henry took a job with the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> and began traveling as an investigator researching conditions, such as education, health and poverty, among Native American communities. He was often absent from the school and Elizabeth supervised it during those absences. In 1932, she returned to school, taking courses at <a href="Wichita%20University">Wichita University</a> part time, where she eventually earned her bachelor's degree. Henry had been appointed as the superintendent of the <a href="Haskell%20Institute">Haskell Institute</a> in 1933 and would work in <a href="Lawrence%2C%20Kansas">Lawrence</a> for the next two years. Elizabeth resigned from her duties at AII in 1934, but continued to live in Wichita so that the children could finish their schooling and herself took graduate courses at the <a href="University%20of%20Kansas">University of Kansas</a>. In 1937, fire destroyed the school and after struggling to remain open for two years, the decision was made to close the school in 1939. That same year, Elizabeth was asked by President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> to serve as a delegate to represent minorities for the <a href="White%20House%20Conference%20on%20Children%20and%20Youth">White House Conference on Children and Youth</a>, examining children and the role of democracy. At the conference, she met <a href="Sadie%20Orr%20Dunbar">Sadie Orr Dunbar</a>, who was the current president of the <a href="General%20Federation%20of%20Women%27s%20Clubs">General Federation of Women's Clubs</a> (GFWC).

In 1940, the family relocated to the <a href="Umatilla%20Indian%20Reservation">Umatilla Indian Reservation</a>, where Henry became superintendent of the agency there. Elizabeth became involved in the <a href="Woman%27s%20club%20movement">Woman's club movement</a>, founding the Oregon Trails Women's Club from women on the reservation. Joining the Oregon State Federation of Women's Clubs, she was appointed to serve as chair for the state organization's Indian Welfare Committee in 1948. Her duties were to implement the club's outreach to Native American women and to help the club members implement the goals of equal citizenship for indigenous people. Henry died of heart failure in 1950, before Elizabeth won the Golden Rule Foundation's Mother of the Year award for 1950. In part, the award was given because all four of her daughters had gone on to earn university educations. Marion had been the first American Indian to graduate from <a href="Wellesley%20%20College">Wellesley College</a>, Anne Woesha was the first indigenous woman to graduate from <a href="Vassar">Vassar</a>, Lillian completed her education at the University of Kansas and Ramona graduated from Vassar. The award propelled her to national speaking and writing engagements and to head the national Indian Affairs Division for the GFWC. She was the first Native American to be named mother of the year, as well as the first to head the GFWC's Indian Affairs Division, which she led for eight years. Developing a "Point Four Program", which included desegregating Indian populations from mainstream schools and opportunities, providing leadership training, expanding cultural programs, and conducting studies. She urged each affiliated club to develop Indian Affairs committees and by 1951 had offices in forty state affiliates. She also pressed for state organizations to offer educational scholarships for Native children. In regard to the last item, Roe Cloud traveled over 22,000 miles over the next two years assessing conditions for tribes in twenty-two states and the <a href="Territory%20of%20Alaska">Territory of Alaska</a>. Simultaneously, she began participating as a field officer of the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20American%20Indians">National Congress of American Indians</a> (NCAI). She had directed a two-week summer stragegy workshop, held in <a href="Brigham%20City%2C%20Utah">Brigham City, Utah</a> in 1951 and began working as a co-director, with <a href="D%27Arcy%20McNickle">D'Arcy McNickle</a> for the American Indian Development Project.

Roe Cloud used her voice as an advocate for indigenous people, arguing that though Native Americans could learn self-sufficiency, the government had to cease efforts to victimize tribes by usurping their power, their natural resources, and their customs. She proposed a Charter of Indian Rights, developed in the AID Project to the GFWC, which was adopted in 1952. In part, the plan called for the government to speed up its efforts to help tribes eliminate poverty and illiteracy, provide adequate health and resource safeguards, and allow Native communities the autonomy to manage their own affairs once they had shown an ability to do so. She saw the role of the AID Project as one of advising and assisting in developing strategy, but allowing communities to establish their own goals and management processes. That same year, she was selected as the "Outstanding Indian" of the year by the <a href="American%20Indian%20Exposition">American Indian Exposition</a> of <a href="Anadarko%2C%20Oklahoma">Anadarko, Oklahoma</a>. When <a href="Helen%20Peterson">Helen Peterson</a> became the executive director of NCAI in 1953, Roe Cloud helped her transition into the job and took her to reservations throughout Indian country to make assessments of the various tribes and establish networking contacts. With the passage of <a href="House%20concurrent%20resolution%20108">House concurrent resolution 108</a>, designed to implement the <a href="Indian%20termination%20policy">Indian termination policy</a> to discharge federal trustee responsibility for Indian lands and force the tribes into <a href="Cultural%20assimilation%20of%20Native%20Americans">assimilating</a> to mainstream culture, Roe Cloud pressed the GFWC to oppose legislation aimed at terminating tribes. The GFWC leadership joined the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a>, other organizations, and the Native American community in opposition to termination, ultimately defeating the policy in the 1960s.

Death and Legacy.
Roe Cloud died on September 16, 1965 in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. Her ability to straddle two worlds, during the contentious decades of the Indian termination policies, allowed her to serve as a role model for generations which followed her activism. Rather than adopt the position of GFWG's first Indian Welfare Committee Chair, Stella Atwood, who backed American Indian rights, but proclaimed, "I will work "for" the Indians but not with them," Roe Cloud tried to involve indigenous people in creating their own solutions and reforms. Her daughter, Anne Woesha, would become an activist after her mother's death, participating in the <a href="Occupation%20of%20Alcatraz">Occupation of Alcatraz</a>.

Apart from its <a href="Surrealism">surreal</a> plot, the move distinguishes itself with one third of the story in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> with <a href="Subtitle%20%28captioning%29">subtitles</a>.

Plot.
The movie plot pays tribute to the fairy tale tradition of innocent children seeing things more clearly than adults (as in <a href="The%20Emperor%27s%20New%20Clothes">The Emperor's New Clothes</a> by <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a> and <a href="Pan%27s%20Labyrinth">Pan's Labyrinth</a> by <a href="Guillermo%20del%20Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a>).

This contemporary <a href="Fantasy">fantasy</a> film follows twelve-year-old girl Mira Gonzaga who has been having terrible dreams after the <a href="traumatic%20brain%20injury">traumatic brain injury</a> of an undisclosed origin.

Taking care of Mira and his pregnant wife, Jesús Gonzaga moves the family away from the city to a secluded <a href="ranch">ranch</a> in the <a href="Texas">Texas</a> hill-country.

Mira soon discovers that the ranch is just as far from safety. She has vivid night dreams, sees her deceased grandmother and a monster who claims to be her soon-to-be-born brother.

There are several hints in the movie that these strange occurrences are taking place as a result of poisoned water from nearby <a href="Hydraulic%20fracturing%20in%20the%20United%20States">fracking operations</a>.

Film action escalates after the <a href="maternal%20death">maternal death</a> of Mira’s mother. When Jesús tries to feed Mira with the poisonous wild boar meat, their neighbor Dimitri comes and saves her, chasing Jesús until giant <a href="drilling%20rig">drilling rig</a>s explode.

Development.
“Harbinger” is the debut feature from writer/director Cody Duckworth, who grew up around <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a> ranches in the Texas hill country.
Film production spanned over seven years from inception to distribution. The original script was written as a horror film while the director was still in college. After producer Jonathan de la Luz came on board the project, the script was rewritten, embracing the eco-thriller genre with fracking as the primary threat in the film.

Release.

The Marion Commercial Historic District is a nationally recognized <a href="Historic%20districts%20in%20the%20United%20States">historic district</a> located in <a href="Marion%2C%20Iowa">Marion, Iowa</a>, United States. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2009. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 41 resources, which included 29 <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20property%20types%23Building">contributing buildings</a>, one <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20property%20types%23Site">contributing site</a>, one <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20property%20types%23Structure">contributing structure</a>, two <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20property%20types%23Object">contributing objects</a>, and eight non-contributing buildings.

François de Wendel

François de Wendel (5 May 1874 – 13 January 1949) was a French industrialist and politician. 
He inherited the leadership of a major steel manufacturer in <a href="Lorraine">Lorraine</a> at a time when it was part of Germany, and in <a href="Meurthe-et-Moselle">Meurthe-et-Moselle</a> in France to the west.
He entered national politics just before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–18), holding office first as a deputy and then as a senator until after the defeat of France in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> (1939–45).
His position in the government and also as head of the largest industrial enterprise in France inevitably led to accusations that he was manipulating policy in favor of his business empire. 

Origins.
The <a href="de%20Wendel%20family">de Wendel family</a> can be traced back to Jean Wendel of <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, who married Marie de Wanderve around 1600.
His descendants in the male line mostly pursued military careers.
Jean's descendent <a href="Jean-Martin%20Wendel">Jean-Martin Wendel</a> (1665–1737) purchased an ironworks in <a href="Hayange">Hayange</a>, Lorraine, in 1704.
This was the foundation of the family's industrial operations.
He was ennobled as Jean-Martin de Wendel in 1727 by <a href="Leopold%2C%20Duke%20of%20Lorraine">Leopold, Duke of Lorraine</a>.
He was followed by eight generations of steelmakers.
The Petits-fils de François de Wendel et Cie (PFFW) was created by Henri de Wendel in 1871 to control the Wendel family's steel operations in Lorraine, at that time annexed to Germany, while Wendel at Cie controlled the operations in France.

Early years (1874–1914).
Birth and education.
François de Wendel was born in Paris on 5 May 1874.
His parents were Henri de Wendel (1844–1906), an industrialist, and Berthe Corbel-Corbeau de Vaulserre.
His mother, who died in 1918, was from a Savoy family that had been ennobled in 1667.
François was the oldest of three sons, followed by <a href="Humbert%20de%20Wendel">Humbert de Wendel</a> (1876–1954) and Maurice de Wendel (1879–1961).
He spent his childhood at Hayange, where his family had operated factories since 1704.

François de Wendel left Lorraine in 1891 to avoid German military service, and finished his secondary education in a Jesuit "lycée" in Paris.
His permit to leave Lorraine prohibited him from returning.
In 1892 François chose to become a naturalized French citizen. His brother Humbert followed his lead later.
He obtained his <a href="baccalaur%C3%A9at">baccalauréat</a>s in letters and sciences, then in 1894 entered the Ecole des Mines, graduating five years later.
During this period he completed one year of military service in Chartres in the 130th Regiment (1896).
In 1899 he earned a diploma of civil engineer of mines.
He traveled in the US until 1901, studying the steel industry there.

François de Wendel married Odette Humann in 1905, daughter of Admiral <a href="Edgar%20Humann">Edgar Humann</a> (1838–1914), known for the conquest of Tonkin.
Their children were Marguerite, Odile, Isabelle, Henri (1913–82) and Renée.

Family business.
As soon as he finished his studies François de Wendel began to work with Henri and <a href="Robert%20de%20Wendel">Robert de Wendel</a>, his father and uncle in the family business.
After the death of Robert de Wendel, in 1903 he became a "gérant" of PFFW in <a href="Hayange">Hayange</a> and Wendel et Cie in <a href="J%C5%93uf">Jœuf</a>, both of which he managed until his death in partnership with his brothers and cousins.
His brother Humbert became a "gérant" in 1906.
During this period the company developed the factories and also built schools, a hospital, a church, a nursery and many houses.
It created a mutual aid society, and began a program of staff pensions, innovative for the time.

The three brothers, François, Humbert and Maurice, worked closely together.
Often they spent the day in the same office and then shared the evening meal.
Maurice handled public relations and social welfare, while Humbert managed the steel mills and relations with the German cartels.
The brothers later said they were so close due to their shared difficulties with the German authorities.

Wendel undertook considerable development of the metallurgical facilities.
He was particularly interested in the mines and blast furnaces, but made sure that all aspects were considered.
Between 1908 and 1913 he built the new Pâtural plant at Hayange using American concepts such as blast furnaces with armoured shafts and skip chargers.

Political activity.
In 1900 François de Wendel became a councilor of the canton of <a href="Briey">Briey</a>, Meurthe-et-Moselle.
From 1906 he subsidized "L'Echo de Lorraine".
In 1906 he ran for deputy for the Briey district against the incumbent, <a href="Albert%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lebrun">Albert François Lebrun</a>, at a time when the separation of church and state was a central issue.
He was accused of being too tied to the church and was decisively defeated.
He was elected a general councillor for Meurthe-et-Moselle in 1907.
He ran for deputy again in 1910, creating the Briey Chamber of Commerce to organize support.
He downplayed relations with the church, made it clear he was a republican, and was helped by <a href="Aristide%20Briand">Aristide Briand</a> and <a href="Alexandre%20Millerand">Alexandre Millerand</a> of the Democratic Left Party, but was defeated again, although this time by a narrow margin.

On 26 April 1914 François de Wendel once more ran for election to the legislature in the second district of Briey.
He was elected on the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20r%C3%A9publicaine">Fédération républicaine</a> platform as a deputy for Meurthe-et-Moselle, holding office until 7 December 1919.
The family opposed his entry into politics, which they thought likely to damage the firm, as did his fellow-members of the <a href="Comit%C3%A9%20des%20forges">Comité des forges</a>.
He would indeed often be accused of acting in the interests of his industrial empire rather than those of France, and this may have damaged the business.
After the post-war slump of 1920 caused unemployment to rise the Wendels were often cast as the villains.
François de Wendel was attacked over his role in World War I, his opposition to the "<a href="Cartel%20des%20Gauches">Cartel des Gauches</a>" led by <a href="%C3%89douard%20Herriot">Édouard Herriot</a> in 1924–26, his support of the nationalist and conservative <a href="Raymond%20Poincar%C3%A9">Raymond Poincaré</a>, and his stance during World War II.

World War I (1914–19).
At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> the three brothers left Hayange in Lorraine and drove to Paris by car.
François de Wendel was assigned to the Permanent Inspection of Manufacturing.
He intervened in the Chamber over fuel supplies and the organization of war factories.
He was a member of committees on War Damage and Invaded Regions.
He assisted refugees and prisoners from Alsace-Lorraine, and formed a study group on Lorraine with Canon Collin and Ambassador Bompard.

Humbert de Wendel was sent to London where he worked with the British government over the supply of arms.
Later a parliamentary commission was set up to review profits made by suppliers of war materials. 
François de Wendel drew up the report of metal industry contracts.
Due to this involvement, there were allegations that the Wendels used their positions to further their interests, but their Lorraine steelworks were behind German lines throughout the war. The Wendels simply provided their expertise in metallurgy and metal markets to the French state.

Inter-war period (1918–39).
Political career.
François de Wendel was reelected deputy for Meurthe-et-Moselle from 16 November 1919 to 31 May 1924 on the Groupe Entente républicaine démocratique platform, from 11 May 1924 to 31 May 1928 on the Union républicaine démocratique platform, from 22 April 1928 to 31 May 1932 on the Union républicaine démocratique platform and from 8 May 1932 to 27 January 1933 on the Fédération républicaine platform.
As a deputy he was president of the Mines Committee and member of other committees including Social Insurance & Welfare, and Foreign Affairs.
From 1919 onward he was a member of the Mines Advisory Committee.
He intervened in many discussions, particularly those related to mines, war damages, finances and Alsace-Lorraine.
He was again elected a general councillor for Meurthe-et-Moselle in 1931.

François de Wendel was elected a senator for Meurthe-et-Moselle on 16 October 1932 in place of Albert Lebrun, who was appointed President of the Republic.
He held office from 10 January 1933 to 31 December 1941.
In the Senate he was a member of the Mines Committee, and often was the rapporteur of this committee, and was a member of the committees on Public Works, Foreign Affairs, Finance and Armies.
He was again involved in numerous discussions, including those related to mines and finances.

Plant modernization.
In 1920 the new Pâtural blast furnaces at Hayange were equipped with McKee revolving distributors.
From 1919 to 1928 the old blast furnaces at Hayange were completely rebuilt to modern plans.
Four blast furnaces were rebuilt, two of them 300 tons.
From 1927 to 1930 the Fenderie factory was rebuilt, with the Martin furnaces expanded.
Several times de Wendel sent teams of engineers to the US and Canada to observe the experiments with new processes for continuous strip rolling, and the solutions that were eventually adopted.
After the war, de Wendel installed an electric bloom-preheating oven at <a href="Moyeuvre-Grande">Moyeuvre-Grande</a>, followed by a powerful continuous billet train, and began a complete overhaul of the blast furnaces along the lines of the successful model at Hayange, but with a more powerful type of blast furnace that processed 400 tons daily of "<a href="Minette%20%28ore%29">minette</a>".
At <a href="J%C5%93uf">Jœuf</a>, where the Germans had completely dismantled the factory before their retreat, an enormous reconstruction task was undertaken very quickly, with the blast furnaces completely overhauled as at Moyeuvre.
All the trains were then electrified. The Wendel plants were among the first to be electrified, using large gas-powered turbines, and a network of gas pipes was installed linking the plants.

Business interests.
François de Wendel was a regent of the <a href="Bank%20of%20France">Bank of France</a> from 1913 to 1936.
François de Wendel, <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20Laurent">Théodore Laurent</a> and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Schneider">Eugène Schneider</a> formed a triumvirate that dominated French steel-making in the inter-war period.
The De Wendel group was probably the most powerful industrial aggregation in France.
In 1929 the de Wendel group was the largest employer in France, with about 33,000 workers.
In 1929 François de Wendel was quietly involved in purchase of the moderate and neutral "<a href="Le%20Temps%20%28Paris%29">Le Temps</a>", but never had exclusive control of that newspaper.

In 1936, Francois de Wendel was among the opponents of the <a href="Popular%20Front%20%28France%29">Popular Front</a>.
In 7 June 1936 Alexandre Lambert-Ribot, secretary general of the Comité des forges, signed the <a href="Matignon%20Agreements%20%281936%29">Matignon Agreements</a> to end the general strike that followed its election.
<a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20de%20la%20production%20fran%C3%A7aise">Confédération générale de la production française</a> President René-Paul Duchemin signed on behalf of French employers.
Forces led by the Wendels and Rothschilds, who were hostile to Duchemin's labour policies, forced an Extraordinary General Assembly in August 1936 to reform the CGPF, which was renamed the <a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20du%20patronat%20fran%C3%A7ais">Confédération générale du patronat français</a> (CGPF) and given a new constitution and leadership.
The changes were approved by the heavy industrialists, 
There were, for example, close links between Pierre Nicolle of the new CGPF and François de Wendel.

Over the years François de Wendel became a director of many companies, including the Société métallurgique de Knutange, Société électrique des Houillères du Pas-de-Calais, Étains et wolfram du Tonkin, Mines de Crespin, Étains du Cameroun, Compagnie indochinoise de métallurgie and Commission des ardoisières d’Angers (1931).
At the end of 1937 PFFW had a capital stock of 117 million francs and De Wendel et Cie had a capital stock of 80 million francs.
François and Maurice de Wendel had official positions in sixteen other companies.
These included the <a href="Banque%20de%20l%27Union%20Parisienne">Banque de l'Union Parisienne</a>, <a href="Suez%20%28company%29">Suez</a>, Société minière et métallurgique de Peñarroya, Union des Mines, several coal.mining companies, two tin companies, other iron and steel manufacturing companies and insurance companies.

Comité des forges.
François de Wendel was president of the Comité des forges de France from 1918 to 1940.
In December 1918 the Comité des forges created the Comptoir sidérurgique de France, which allocated quotas to members of the steel cartel.
During the war the government had ran the National Coal Bureau with a system under which small steel producers who could not get cheap domestic coal were subsidized in buying more expensive imports.
After the war the Comité des forges president François de Wendel asked that this function be transferred to a consortium organized by the Committee. 
The small producers were opposed to this measure, which seemed likely to confirm the advantage of the large companies.

In the post-war period the <a href="Union%20des%20industries%20et%20m%C3%A9tiers%20de%20la%20m%C3%A9tallurgie">Union des industries et métiers de la métallurgie</a> (UIMM) acted in effect as the instrument of the Comité des forges for handling social issues.
In 1919 <a href="Robert%20Pinot">Robert Pinot</a> was secretary of both organizations.
In 1921 Pinot asked Francois de Wendel to make him a vice-president of the Comité des forges.
Although Pinot was committed and efficient, he had a tendency to take credit for the Committee's actions.
He was an employee rather than an owner, and de Wendel made it clear he would only be the most junior of five vice-presidents, with no prospect of becoming president.

World War II and later years (1939–49).
In June 1940 François de Wendel refrained from going to <a href="Vichy">Vichy</a> to vote full powers to Marshal <a href="Philippe%20P%C3%A9tain">Philippe Pétain</a>.
The Wendel works were occupied by German troops on 16 June 1940.
After the capitulation of France the Germans wanted to get the works back into operation as quickly as possible.
Francois and Humbert de Wendel were given permits to travel to Hayange, where they were shown an authorization by <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> on 12 July 1940 for the Saar businessman <a href="Hermann%20R%C3%B6chling">Hermann Röchling</a> to take control of the works.
The Wendels were forced to leave Lorraine on 48 hours notice.
Röchling pledged to destroy the Wendel family interests.

Under the <a href="Vichy%20regime">Vichy regime</a> the Comité des forges was dissolved by decree on 9 November 1940.
It was replaced by the Comité d'organisation de la sidérurgie (CORSID – Organizing Committee for the Iron and Steel Industry).
François de Wendel was excluded from the CORSID.
The Commission générale was created in 1941, with similar membership to the Comité des forges: five members were removed and three added.
Both François and Humbert de Wendel were appointed to the Commission générale.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> (1939–45) François de Wendel put his energy into rebuilding the <a href="Meurthe-et-Moselle">Meurthe-et-Moselle</a> metallurgical factories, and was also interested in the coal industry of <a href="Limburg%20%28Netherlands%29">Limburg</a> in the Netherlands.
His evaluation of the steel works around Hayange was that they were very antiquated, and were not worth a large investment in modernization. 
He wrote of the Pâtural plant in Hayange in May 1946, "If things depended solely on me, I would rebuild almost as it was ... I would strive, by reducing to a minimum the modifications brought to the previous construction, to build this furnace as quickly and as economically as possible. But it is important to remember that our projects will have to be approved by the Professional Office of the Steel Industry and that if we do not adopt a crucible diameter of 5.250 meters, we risk being considered retrogressives."

In January 1947 François de Wendel told the president of the Nancy Chamber of Commerce that proposals to undertake a major expansion of the steel industry were "both dishonest and foolish."
In 1947 <a href="Konrad%20Adenauer">Konrad Adenauer</a> and <a href="Robert%20Pferdmenges">Robert Pferdmenges</a> proposed to invite French compaies to take controlling interests in major Ruhr steel producers. 
François de Wendel dismissed this plan out of hand when he was approached in November 1947.

François de Wendel died in Paris on 13 January 1949.
He was replaced by his son, Henri, whom many saw as timid and ineffectual, broken by his father's domineering character.

The club took the opportunity to develop a new stadium on the field and named it McLaren Field, and moved into the new stadium in 1965. The ground was home to the club for the next 30 years but by the early 1990s considerable improvements were needed which the club could not afford so in 1995 Bramley left McLaren Field and the ground was sold.
Current use.
The ground was demolished and a new housing estate called McLaren Fields was built on the site.

In both the 1851 and 1861 censuses, Sugden's occupation was recorded as "warehouseman", however, he was able to support a large family with four servants and in 1861 employed a governess. By the time of the 1871 census he was described as a "merchant".

In the late 1860s he purchased a farm and farmhouse on land that was formerly part of <a href="Enfield%20Chase">Enfield Chase</a>, the royal hunting ground. He rebuilt the house into a much more substantial residence known as Oak Lodge with a walled garden, orchard, <a href="ice%20well">ice well</a>, and a collection of outbuildings. He made his own gas in an outbuilding at the lodge and a <a href="gasometer">gasometer</a> is shown on contemporary <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> maps.

He ran Chase Farm in Chase Road, approximately where the modern Merrivale road is, that was later known as Oak Lodge Farm.

Death and legacy.
Sugden died on 12 October 1896 leaving his estate to trustees. By that time he was known as Samuel Sugden the elder. Probate was granted in London to "Samuel Sugden gentleman, Charles Alfred Sugden merchant and Charles Eustace-Wilson gentleman" on an estate of £140,034, resworn in 1898 in the amount of £139,005. Charles Alfred Sugden was Samuel's son, Charles Eustace-Wilson was a solicitor, and the relationship of the living Samuel Sugden to the deceased is unknown. In July 1897, Oak Lodge was advertised for sale by auction in "The Times".

Oak Lodge and its outbuildings were demolished just after the end of the First World War and in 1927 <a href="Southgate%20Urban%20District%20Council">Southgate Urban District Council</a> purchased 50 acres from Sugden's executors which it combined with 8.5 acres it purchased from the <a href="Vicar%20of%20Enfield">Vicar of Enfield</a> to form <a href="Oakwood%20Park%2C%20Enfield">Oakwood Park</a>.

Jane Nasmyth

Jane Nasmyth (1787-1867) was a Scottish landscape painter of the Nasmyth School in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. She was the daughter and student of the portrait and landscape painter <a href="Alexander%20Nasmyth">Alexander Nasmyth</a>.

Early Life.
Jane Nasmyth was born in Edinburgh in 1787 to Barbara Foulis and <a href="Alexander%20Nasmyth">Alexander Nasmyth</a>. Alexander Nasmyth and Barbara Foulis (the daughter of <a href="William%20Foulis">William Foulis</a>, Esq. of Woodhall) had married on January 3, 1786, and were living in Edinburgh where Alexander worked as a painter. Jane was the eldest of eight children: Jane, Barbara, Margaret, Elizabeth, <a href="Anne%20Nasmyth">Anne</a>, Charlotte, <a href="Patrick%20Nasmyth">Patrick</a>, and <a href="James%20Nasmyth">James</a>. Alexander Nasmyth worked as a portrait artist and painter of outdoor conversation pieces in the late 1780s, painting and befriending the poet <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a> and establishing the Nasmyth school of landscape painting in his home at 47 York Place, Edinburgh. Jane Nasmyth grew up in a home that served as an artistic and cultural center of Edinburgh. She helped raise her siblings, advise her parents in domestic and financial matters, and train artists at the Nasmyth school; for her sound judgment, she was nicknamed “Old Solid”.

Career.
Jane Nasmyth and her siblings were trained as artists by their father, who employed innovative teaching techniques by encouraging sketching landscapes outdoors. She worked closely with Alexander, who encouraged his daughters to become professional artists. All the Nasmyth sisters as well as Patrick Nasmyth exhibited their work and painted professionally in London, Manchester, and Edinburgh. In the early years of her artistic practice, Jane Nasmyth collaborated with her father and worked under his close supervision, producing landscapes which were considered indistinguishable from his and which were sold as pictures “by Miss Jane, with some of [Alexander Nasmyth’s] painting on it,” possibly to increase profit.

Nasmyth went on to be recognized as a prominent landscape painter and to participate in numerous exhibitions. From 1826-29, she exhibited at the British Institution. She exhibited the painting "Loch Katrine—from the Point of west Drumberg" in the 1837 Exhibition of the Liverpool Academy, in which Anne, Charlotte, and Alexander Nasmyth were also featured. She took part in the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1843. In the 1840s, she exhibited “a finely-painted bit of Highland scenery” in the Exhibition of the Works of Modern Artists in Manchester; "On the Derwent, Borodale, Cumberland" and "Distant View of Stirling from Alloa" at the Birmingham Society of Artists; and "View of Perth"; "Comrie, Perthshire"; and "Windsor Forest" at the Devon and Exeter Society for the Encouragement of Art. She again exhibited at the Birmingham Society of Artists in 1846, with the paintings "Lake of Windermere" and "On the Tweed, near Drygrange, Roxburghshire". From 1839 to 1866, Nasmyth exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists; from 1830 to 1862, at the Royal Scottish Academy; from 1862 to 1865, at the Royal Glasgow Institute.

Deakin Government (1905-1908)

The Deakin Government (1905-1908) refers to the period of federal Executive Government of Australia led by Prime Minister Sir <a href="Alfred%20Deakin">Alfred Deakin</a>. It lasted from 5 July 1905 - 13 Nov 1908. Deakin was the second <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a> having previously led the <a href="Deakin%20Government%20%281903-1904%29">Deakin Government (1903-1904)</a>, and held the office again in 1909–1910. 

Alfred Deakin.
Alfred Deakin (1856–1919) – a barrister, journalist and important Federation era politician – was born in Melbourne in 1856. He first entered the Victorian Parliament as a Liberal in 1879. He attended all the official Federal conferences and conventions working towards federation of Britain's Australian colonies, and was skilled at brokering compromises. He played a significant part in shaping the Australian Constitution, and arguing the case for unity of the colonies.

Deakin was a fine orator and major player in the establishment of the institutions of Australian Democracy, and served three times in the office of Prime Minister during the first ten years of Australia's Federation.

Background.
Alfred Deakin first became Prime Minister after <a href="Edmund%20Barton">Edmund Barton</a> resigned to become a judge on the first <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a>. The first Deakin Government failed to pass any legislation in the newly formed Australian Federal Parliament. The Protectionists' shaky coalition with the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> did not long survive the December 1903 Election, and by the resumption of Parliament in March 1904, the Deakin Government had fallen, amid a dispute over a Labor Party amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.

The early years of Federation saw a volatile political environment. The first Deakin Government ended on 27 April 1904, making way for the first Australian Labor Party government of Australia, led by <a href="Chris%20Watson">Chris Watson</a>. In August that year, the Protectionists split with radical liberals, <a href="Isaac%20Isaacs">Isaac Isaacs</a> and <a href="William%20Lyne">William Lyne</a>, aligning with the Labor Party against the Free Trade Party of <a href="George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29">George Reid</a>.

The <a href="Reid%20Government">Reid Government</a> lasted from 18 August 1904 - 5 July 1905. Reid denounced the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labour Party</a> as the "Socialist tiger". Watson encouraged <a href="Alfred%20Deakin">Alfred Deakin</a> to abandon the Free Traders, saying: "We, and especially me, don't want office, but I have the utmost anxiety to stop the retrogressive movement which Reid is heading." Deakin commenced his second term as Prime Minister in July 1905, with Labour's support

Phialemonium obovatum

Phialemonium obovatum is a <a href="saprophytic">saprotrophic</a> filamentous fungus able to cause opportunistic infections in humans with weakened immune systems. "P. obovatum" is widespread throughout the environment, occurring commonly in sewage, soil, air and water. Walter Gams and Michael McGinnis described the genus "Phialemonium" to accommodate species intermediate between the genera "Acremonium" and "Phialophora." Currently, three species of "Phialemonium" are recognized of which "P. obovatum" is the only one to produce greenish colonies and obovate conidia."" It has been investigated as one of several microfungi with potential use in the accelerated aging of wine.

Growth and morphology.
In culture, colonies of "P. obovatum" begin as white or off-white in colour becoming pale green and centrally darkened with age. The green pigments diffuse into the growth medium ultimately becoming blackish-green in colour. Although the hyphae of the fungus are typically colourless (hyaline), the presence of these dark diffusible pigments has resulted in this species being considered one of the <a href="dematiaceous">dematiaceous</a> (aka filamentous, darkly-pigmented) fungi. This placement may be further justified by the confirmation of melanin pigments in hyphal walls and septa as demonstrated by Fontana-Masson's staining procedure. These melanins are responsible for the slight dark coloration of hyphae and conidia as well as the dark colours seen in the center of the colonies.

Pathogenicity.
Although "P. obovatum" is primarily thought to be saprotrophic, it can cause infections in human hosts under certain circumstances, and more rarely, of other animals notably dogs. The capacity of "Phialemonium obovatum" to grow at and above human <a href="Human%20body%20temperature">body temperature</a> is a key pathogenicity factor of this species that distinguishes it from many other dematiaceous molds. This species has been reported as a causative agent of <a href="endocarditis">endocarditis</a>, <a href="keratitis">keratitis</a>, <a href="peritonitis">peritonitis</a>, <a href="osteomyelitis">osteomyelitis</a>, subcutaneous infections, and infections arising secondary to burns. In case studies involving infections following severe burns, the hyphae of "P. obovatum" have the ability to invade into blood vessels and tissues. Infections caused by this species are largely opportunistic and restricted to immunocompromised individuals with few cases reported from individuals with normally functional immune systems. It has a proclivity to invade central nervous system tissues. Given the rising population burden of immunocompromised people due to improved management of immunological diseases or mediate by therapeutic side effects, this and other agents of opportunistic disease are sometimes considered to be "emerging" agents of disease. Accordingly, "P. obovatum" and other dematiaceous fungi have been increasingly reported in allogenic transplant recipients possibly as a consequence of chemotherapeutic immune suppression primarily intended to reduce tissue rejection.

The sequestration of antioxidant materials in cells walls may also serve as a virulence factors for this agent. A yeast-like phase has also been reported from the blood of infected individuals. "P. obovatum" can cause localized or disseminated infections the latter of which are occasionally fatal.

Biotechnology.
Colonization of wood by "P. obovatum" has been shown to produce syringol - a compound that is produced when the wood is heated, and guaiacol, a thermal decomposition product of lignin that is characterized by an oaky, burnt aroma. Both compounds but particularly guaiacol are important contributors to the "oaked" flavour characteristics of barrel-aged wine. Treatment of wines using wood chips inoculated with "P. obovatum" and other microfungi has been investigated as an accelerated, cost effective means of imparting oak flavours than traditional cask aging.

Detre Rajki

Detre Rajki (; died after 1523) was a Hungarian nobleman and jurist, one of the best-known professional lawyers in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281301%E2%80%931526%29">Jagiellonian Era</a>.

Family.
He was born into a medium landowner noble family, which originated from <a href="Zala%20County%20%28former%29">Zala County</a>, as the only son of György Rajki (died before 1494) and Katalin Osgyáni. He had a sister Borbála (or Potencia). She married Gotthárd Sitkei, castellan of <a href="P%C3%A1pa">Pápa</a> who participated in the suppression of <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20D%C3%B3zsa">György Dózsa's peasant revolt</a>. Detre first appeared in contemporary records as a minor in 1489, thus possibly he was born in the second half of the 1470s.

Detre Rajki married Rusint Tejedi in the early 1490s (she was first mentioned in 1495). Her father Imre Tejedi was castellan of <a href="Szombathely">Szombathely</a> (1451–1474) then <a href="Gy%C5%91r">Győr</a>, while was also <a href="Isp%C3%A1n">"vice"-ispán</a> of <a href="Gy%C5%91r%20County">Győr County</a> (1460–1465) as a "<a href="Familiaris">familiar</a>" to Bishop <a href="Augustine%20Sal%C3%A1nki">Augustine Salánki</a>. Furthermore, Rajki's wife also related to the influential noble families in Zala County, such as the Sárkánys and Kávásis. They had five children.

Legal practice.
His personal handwritten letter ("missilis") from February 1496 proves Rajki's literacy. Since the 1510s, Rajki involved as a lawyer in numerous lawsuits in different parts of the country, which fact confirms his professional status. For instance, he defended the interests of the <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> chapter against <a href="George%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Ansbach">George of Brandenburg</a> before the court of <a href="Petar%20Berislavi%C4%87">Petar Berislavić</a>, <a href="Ban%20of%20Croatia">Ban of Croatia</a> in 1517. He represented Ladislaus Báthory of the Szaniszlófi branch during a long-time decades of lawsuit on the question of ownership over landholdings against some members of the Báthory of Somlyó and the Perényi families in 1519. The Szaniszlófis' defense team was initially led by another famous contemporary lawyer Gergely Makrai, and subsequently directed by Rajki, while Ferenc Fancsikai represented the Perényis. In 1523, Rajki defended Borbála, wife of the disgraced Ferenc Hédervári, Ban of Belgrade (who allegedly <a href="Siege%20of%20Belgrade%20%281521%29">handed over</a> the castle to the Ottomans without resistance), to prevent confiscation and distribution of the Hédervári lands among other relatives. Rajki also represented the <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20Eger">Eger chapter</a> and the Székesfehérvár Convent of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem in 1519 and 1520, respectively.

Harry Orbell

Harry Orbell (1858 – 27 March 1914) was a <a href="British%20people">British</a> <a href="trade%20unionist">trade unionist</a>.

Born in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, Orbell trained as a writing desk maker, but was unable to find sufficient work, and so instead found employment at a tea warehouse, repairing tea chests. In 1887, there was a proposal to reduce wages of workers at the warehouse, and Orbell helped organise a meeting in opposition to this. The meeting founded the <a href="Tea%20Operatives%27%20and%20General%20Labourers%27%20Association">Tea Operatives' and General Labourers' Association</a>, with Orbell becoming its president.

The union played a key role in the <a href="London%20Dock%20strike%20of%201889">London Dock strike of 1889</a>, with Orbell leading strike action at the nearby <a href="Tilbury%20Docks">Tilbury Docks</a>. He kept the strike solid there, in part by sending trade unionists to infiltrate groups of workers unwittingly recruited to break the strike, then getting the unionists to leaflet the new workers, informing them of their situation, and requesting that they return to London.

Following the strike, the union grew dramatically in size and became the <a href="Dock%2C%20Wharf%2C%20Riverside%20and%20General%20Labourers%27%20Union">Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union</a>, with Orbell as one of two full-time national organisers (alongside Tom McCarthy). Orbell initially travelled to the Netherlands, where he founded branches in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>. Later, he was based in London, but regularly travelled the country, and was one of the first to spot <a href="Ernest%20Bevin">Ernest Bevin</a>'s talents, successfully recommending him to <a href="Ben%20Tillett">Ben Tillett</a> for a full-time post.

Orbell was one of the main organisers of the successful <a href="1911%20Liverpool%20general%20transport%20strike">1911 Liverpool general transport strike</a>. The following year, he advised against transport workers in London holding a strike; the workers voted for strike action and Orbell then supported them, but the ten-week strike was ultimately unsuccessful. Already in poor health, the strain of this worsened his condition and although he recovered for a while, he became ill again in late 1913 and died in March 1914.

Although Orbell never stood for political office, he supported the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>, and served for some years on its <a href="National%20Executive%20Committee">National Executive Committee</a>. He also served on the <a href="Port%20of%20London%20Authority">Port of London Authority</a>.

<doc id="54834065" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54834065" title="Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey">
Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey

The Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey is a nationwide survey on <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a> which is planned to be held in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> between 12 September and 7 November 2017. As the survey shares some characteristics with a <a href="Plebiscites%20in%20Australia">plebiscite</a>, it is also informally referred to as a plebiscite or postal vote.

A <a href="Survey%20%28human%20research%29">survey</a> form (similar to a <a href="ballot%20paper">ballot paper</a>) will be <a href="mail">mail</a>ed out by the <a href="Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> to every Australian on the <a href="electoral%20roll">electoral roll</a>, asking the question ""Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?"". The <a href="Turnbull%20Government">Turnbull Government</a>, the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">federal government</a> since September 2015, has pledged to facilitate the introduction of a <a href="private%20member%27s%20bill">private member's bill</a> to <a href="Recognition%20of%20same-sex%20unions%20in%20Australia">legalise same-sex marriage</a> if the result of the survey is in favour of same-sex marriage.

Background.
History.
Prior to the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202016">July 2016 federal election</a>, the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a>/<a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">National</a> <a href="Coalition%20%28Australia%29">Coalition</a> <a href="Turnbull%20Government">government</a>, headed by <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Malcolm%20Turnbull">Malcolm Turnbull</a>, promised to hold a national vote on same-sex marriage, in the form of a compulsory-attended <a href="Referendums%20in%20Australia">plebiscite</a>.

While the Coalition won half the seats in the lower house in the 2016 election and managed to form a <a href="majority%20government">majority government</a> by one seat, they failed to pass the necessary legislation for a (compulsory attendance) referendum/plebiscite. The legislation passed the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> on 20 October 2016 by a vote of 76–67, but was rejected by the <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a> on 7 November 2016 by a vote of 33–29. In August 2017, following an attempt by five Liberal Party <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MPs</a> to change party policy and have a <a href="conscience%20vote">free vote</a> in the parliament on same-sex marriage legislation, the government announced it would move for a voluntary postal survey to be held later that year. It was stated that this would only occur in the event the government's (compulsory) referendum/plebiscite legislation was again rejected by the Senate. That occurred on 9 August 2017, when a government-initiated motion in the Senate to debate the "Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill 2016" was tied at 31–31; resulting in the motion being defeated.

Following the result in the Senate, the government directed the <a href="Australian%20Statistician">Australian Statistician</a> to begin the process of collecting statistical information on a voluntary basis, from all Australians on the electoral roll, as to their views on same sex marriage. The government asserted that this proposal did not require legislative approval from the parliament, arguing that the provisions of the "Appropriations Act" and the law governing the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) enabled it to use the ABS for such a purpose. This has been argued by the government to be similar to the process by which <a href="God%20Save%20the%20Queen">God Save the Queen</a> was replaced by <a href="Advance%20Australia%20Fair">Advance Australia Fair</a> as the Australian national anthem. The government announced the ABS would be assisted by having staff seconded from the <a href="Australian%20Electoral%20Commission">Australian Electoral Commission</a> (AEC), the organisation responsible for <a href="elections%20in%20Australia">elections in Australia</a> and managing the <a href="electoral%20roll">electoral roll</a>. The cost of the survey to the Australian taxpayer is forecast to be $122 million.

The AEC reported that approximately 68,000 enrolment transactions were completed on 10 August, compared with an average of 4,000 per day. In the period 8–14 August over 16,000 people had enrolled, and over 200,000 have updated their details.

The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee opened a hearing on the arrangements around the postal vote on 14 August.

Legal challenge.
When the idea of a postal plebiscite/vote was first raised, several legal experts warned of concerns regarding the capacity for such a vote to be held without parliamentary approval. Constitutional expert <a href="George%20Williams%20%28lawyer%29">George Williams</a> described the proposal as a "poorly constructed vote for which [the government] doesn't have the correct procedures". Anne Twomey, a constitutional law expert from the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a> Law School expressed scepticism over the role of the <a href="Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> (ABS) in the vote, stating that "the power of the ABS is to collect statistics...rather than opinions. Someone might therefore challenge it on the ground that it does not fall within the legislative functions of the ABS". Both experts further doubted the capacity of the <a href="Second%20Turnbull%20Ministry">Finance Minister</a> to allocate the necessary funding ($122 million) to the ABS, considering that such a non-legislated advance to a department can only be made in "unforeseen circumstances". The government refused to release the legal advice it received to the public, though <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Australia">Attorney-General</a> <a href="George%20Brandis">George Brandis</a> stated in an interview with the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">ABC</a> "<a href="7.30">7.30</a>" program that "we have acted on Solicitor-General's advice in which we are confident".

At least two legal challenges have been lodged with the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a>. Same-sex marriage advocates Shelley Argent (national spokeswoman of <a href="Parents%20and%20Friends%20of%20Lesbians%20and%20Gays">Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays</a>) and Felicity Marlowe (member of Rainbow Families), along with <a href="Independent%20%28politics%29">independent</a> MP <a href="Andrew%20Wilkie">Andrew Wilkie</a>, announced they would challenge the postal vote in the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court</a> on 9 August 2017 and seek a temporary injunction. The following day, the Human Rights Law Centre filed a legal action on behalf of <a href="Australian%20Marriage%20Equality">Australian Marriage Equality</a> and <a href="Australian%20Greens">Greens</a> Senator <a href="Janet%20Rice">Janet Rice</a>. The court has agreed to hear arguments in the cases on 5 and 6 September 2017 without any temporary injunction being ordered.

Key dates.
The following dates are noteworthy in the context of their relation to the survey:

The result of the survey (including participation rates) will be released at a national level, at a <a href="Australian%20states%20and%20territories">state and territory</a> level and at an <a href="Divisions%20of%20the%20Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">electorate</a> level.

Rules.
The vote will be conducted on a voluntary basis, with no requirement on the part of the voter to mail back the ballot paper. This has led to concerns over a potentially low voter turnout/response rate and the prospect of <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> in remote communities being unable to vote. Unlike <a href="Elections%20in%20Australia">elections or referendums</a>, there will be no special regulations relating to advertising requirements or prohibited content and neither the 'yes' or 'no' campaign will receive public funding, as was envisioned for a compulsory attendance plebiscite. All Australians whose names are on the <a href="electoral%20roll">electoral roll</a> or have applied to be put on the roll before 24 August 2017 will be mailed a ballot and Australian citizens living overseas who have registered with the <a href="Australian%20Electoral%20Commission">AEC</a> as an overseas voter will be entitled to vote. The AEC has made a statement that provisionally-enrolled 16 and 17 year olds will not be posted the survey. Those who turn 18 after 24 August will not be included in the survey.

The government has announced it is considering passing a bill in the parliament which would apply the same advertising restrictions that are in place for ordinary elections, which prohibit malicious campaigning and bribery. If this bill gains bipartisan support, this may have the effect of delegitimising the legal challenge to the postal survey.

Question.
The survey form will ask respondents:

"Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?"

The government has stated it will facilitate a <a href="private%20member%27s%20bill">private member's bill</a> in the parliament which would legalise same-sex marriage, if a majority of survey respondents answer 'yes' to the question.

<a href="George%20Brandis">George Brandis</a> has stated that Senator <a href="Dean%20Smith%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Dean Smith</a>'s private member's bill is the draft bill under discussion.

Support and opposition.
Official party positions in a Parliament Vote.
These are official positions held by political parties in Australian Parliament in regard to the issue of same-sex marriage itself. 
The <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> official position is in support of same sex marriage, though any MPs and Senators will not be bound to campaign and vote for it in Parliament up until 2019. 
The <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a> position in regard to same-sex marriage is to hold a plebiscite of some kind before any change to the law is made; no official position has been adopted on the survey itself, hence Liberal MPs (including Cabinet members) are free to campaign and vote for either campaign, and all politicians may use their electoral printing and communications budget to campaign.



NO campaign.
Political parties.
Other <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20political%20parties">political parties</a> known to be supporting a 'no' vote include the None of these parties have representation in <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">federal parliament</a> though the CDP has representation in the upper house of the New South Wales parliament.



Religious groups.
Denominational leaders who advocate a 'no' vote include: 

Religious leaders who advocate a 'no' vote include:

Religious groups who advocate a 'no' vote include:

Public opinion.
Public <a href="opinion%20poll">polling</a> conducted in Australia recently has indicated a comfortable majority of <a href="Australians">Australians</a> support same-sex marriage.

Aftermath.
Marriage Amendment Act.
In the event the survey returns a majority in favour of allowing same-sex marriage, a <a href="bill%20%28law%29">bill</a> to amend the "<a href="Marriage%20Act%201961%20%28Australia%29">Marriage Act</a>" will be presented to the parliament and the government has stated it will facilitate its passage through both houses. 

Controversies and issues.
Advocacy by state, territory and local governments.
The <a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">ACT Chief Minister</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Barr">Andrew Barr</a>, a strong supporter of same-sex marriage, made an emotional plea to fellow assembly members to support the use of "significant Government resources" for promotional campaigns on government buses and flagpoles in Canberra. He also said the government was considering "creating rainbow roundabouts and commissioning rainbow-themed murals". This was criticised by the opposition party, the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Canberra Liberals</a> and by several talkback callers on <a href="ABC%20Radio%20Canberra">ABC Radio</a>.

The <a href="City%20of%20Darebin">City of Darebin</a> announced it will allow 'yes' campaigners to use council facilities and services for free in the lead up to the postal survey on same-sex marriage. But 'no' campaigners will be barred from using council facilities, with Darebin council rejecting suggestions they were limiting free speech.

Counselling for those impacted.
For <a href="LGBTIQ">LGBTIQ</a> people for whom the debate may be having an negative impact, <a href="Telephone%20counseling">helpline</a>s, strategies and counsellors have been made available by a number of organisations including the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">ABC</a>, <a href="Sexual%20orientation%20and%20the%20Australian%20Defence%20Force%23DEFGLIS">Defence (DEFGLIS)</a>, <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Victoria">Victorian local councils</a> and AlfredHealth. Information from, and links to, further resources including <a href="Beyond%20Blue">Beyond Blue</a>, the Aids Council of New South Wales, the Victorian Aids Council, Queerspace and the <a href="Safe%20Schools%20Coalition%20Australia">Safe Schools</a> program, are also available. The <a href="Greens%20Western%20Australia">WA Greens</a> have called for more government funding for LGBTIQ mental health services to be made available during the government's marriage survey. The <a href="Government%20of%20Victoria">Victorian Government</a> has provided $500,000 extra for support services.

Wording of question.
The wording used in the question, 'same-sex couples' may have implications for the <a href="transgender">transgender</a> community, and has lead to claims of possible discrimination.

He completed his master's degree in music there.
Establishment of Pakistan Music Conference.
After the <a href="independence%20of%20Pakistan">independence of Pakistan</a> in 1947, there was definitely a need for a formal organization on a national level to encourage the classical musicians/vocalists living in obscurity and feeling neglected.

So Hayat Ahmad Khan, along with several other music connoisseurs, laid the foundation of "All Pakistan Music Conference" back in 1959. APMC started holding a six-day music festival starting in 1960 where classical, semi-classical, <a href="folk%20music">folk</a> and light music events (including <a href="ghazal">ghazal</a> evenings) were held to promote the cause of music in Pakistan.

Pakistan's <a href="Dawn%20%28newspaper%29">Dawn (newspaper)</a> comments in 2014, "The event has a huge contribution towards introducing new talent to music fanciers of the country and revitalizing classical and semi-classical music through seasoned musicians and singers."

Mohamed Mufti

Mohamed Bey Mufti (surname also written El-Mufti & Elmufti), is a Libyan surgeon, historian and political activist, born in Derna, Libya on 11 September 1943.

Early life.
In 1949, when Mohamed Mufti was 6 years old, his family moved to Benghazi where his father opened a men’s clothes shop in Omar Mukhtar Street, in the center of the town. In that city of contrasts, Mohamed Mufti received his education. In 1960 he came first in the secondary school examination for the whole of Libya, and was thus awarded a scholarship to study in the UK. Many of his early experiences are recorded in his social history books; "Chats in Benghazi", "The Old Man’s Shop or Chats in the Market", and "The Derna Dialogs".
Mohamed’s close relationship with his father was another source of early and rich experiences. His father had received modern education in the Italian colonial schools in 1930’s. Subsequently, like many of his urban generation, the elder Mufti supported the Omar Mukhtar Association (named after the heroic leader of resistance (1923–1931) against the Italian Occupation. The Association was also Arab Nationalist in spirit and opposed to Emir Idris Sanousi’s aspirations.

The shop gave the young Mufti a platform to observe the political disputes raging at the time. The commercial street also housed the Official Municipality, a printing press owned by an estranged leader of opposition, and the offices of Zaman Newspaper that supported the Emir Idris Sanousi. In the adjacent square there was a famous café, where intellectuals used to meet, and was the haunt of the charismatic poet and voice of national opposition, Ahmad Rafiq Mahdawy. As a lad, Mohamed was exceptionally lucky to accompany his father on business trips to Tripoli and Italy itself, widening the boy’s perception of own country and the world.

The UK experience.
In England Mohamed Mufti was eventually admitted to the <a href="Leeds%20University%20Medical%20School">Leeds University Medical School</a> where he graduated in 1968. Life in Yorkshire was another rich experience, while the Leeds University student Union was throbbing with activity which attracted the young Libyan student, from theatre to political demonstration against <a href="South%20African%20Apartheid">South African Apartheid</a>.

In addition, Mohamed Mufti participated in the UK Libyan and Arab Student Union activities. He was secretary then leader of the Libyan Student Union, and for one year, member of the Arab Student Union Council and editor of its magazine.

His early UK stay culminated with his marriage to Nita Nicholson, a graduate in Fine Arts at Leeds.

Work at Baida, Libya.
In the summer of 1969, Dr Mufti, along with his wife (now with an Arabic name Amna) and newborn son Hishaam, returned to Benghazi. At the time the regime of King Idris was toppled in a coup by young army officers, led by Lt Muamar Gaddaafi. Dr Mufti was promptly appointed to work in the Green Mountain Region, where he was to work for two years as the only Libyan doctor in the area. In Baida, his daughter Sehaam was born.

The stay in Baida which Dr Mufti enjoyed, was in another sense ill-starred as he was to meet there and clash with the new leader of the military regime, an ambitious paranoid and ruthless man who, over the years morphed into a narcissistic tyrant. In contrast Dr Mufti was at the time, politically naïve deeply influenced by social-democratic principles.

Work at Leeds, UK (1971–1973).
In mid 1971, Dr Mufti returned to the <a href="Leeds%20General%20Infirmary">Leeds General Infirmary</a>, where he joined, as a research fellow, the Cardiac Surgery Unit led by the pioneering Marion Ionescu. His contribution included co-authoring two papers published in 1974.

Prisoner of Conscience.
In April 1973, Dr Mufti was asked by the Libyan Minister of Health to participate in a committee for setting up a cardiac surgery department in Tripoli. He was arrested soon after arrival, in a campaign which Gaddaafi launched against intellectuals suspected of disloyalty.
Details of Dr Mufti’s prison experiences (1973–1984) and those of many other political inmates, are described in his book; "Behind a Wall of Years". According to the author, Gaddaafi, motivated by his morbid fears and suspicions, would first move against his potential victims and get them arrested. Then his ‘apparatus’ would work out the fake accusations. Dr Mufti was arrested along with scores of intellectuals, tried twice, given a sentence of four years (which he had completed), but Gaddaafi raised the sentence to life imprisonment. He was released in January 1984, thanks to the efforts of his wife and friends in the UK as well as <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>. He was to spend another 5 years banned from travelling abroad, before regaining his passport in 1989.

The Surgeon.
Soon after discharge from political detention, Dr Mufti resumed his clinical work, as a surgeon at Hawari Teaching Hospital (1985–1997). At Hawari Dr Mufti did much clinical research initially on post-operative infection, assessing newer antibiotics. During that period he developed and reported (1993) a simplified procedure for sclerotherapy of the gallbladder under local anaesthesia, mainly for cases with problems that would contra-indicate general anaesthesia. His other main field of interest was the management of Hydatid cysts (<a href="echinococcosis">echinococcosis</a>), common in Libyan countryside, updating knowledge of the disease in a book that was published in UK (1989).

The Muntazah Clinic.
Towards the end of 1990’s Gaddaafi reversed his failed socialist policies, permitting private work. Dr Mufti, who was being harassed by members of the heinous Revolutionary Committees, opted to retire from the Health Service, and devote his efforts to the Muntazah private clinic. For nearly two decades, the surgical facility has been offering care to patients suffering from anal conditions, a narrow specialty but common and often very painful ailments. Apart from routine OPD & Surgical care, Dr Mufti has developed newer procedures including total excision of <a href="anal%20fistula">anal fistula</a>, a chronic and a stubborn lesion.

The Politician.
In September 2012, Dr Mufti was one of the eight nominations for Prime Minister of Libya.. Each nomination needed at least fifteen supporters among the 200 members of the General National Council. After two rounds of voting in the National Assembly, Deputy Prime minister <a href="Mustafa%20A.G.%20Abushagur">Mustafa A.G. Abushagur</a> was elected Prime Minister.

Family.
Dr Mufti’s middle name is Bey, after his great-grand father, a ruler and reformer of <a href="Derna%2C%20Libya">Derna, Libya</a> in the 17th century, who is of the Caramanli descent whose members ruled Tripoli and much of Libya for nearly two centuries. The ancestor constructed (or renewed?) an aqueduct that brought water from a waterfall some 12 km south of the town, to irrigate the town’s garden farms. For such achievements his status, in public memory, has been that of a saint.
The Mufti surname is derived from the title of Dr Mufti’s immediate grandfather who was appointed as the religious juror of Derna by the Ottman Sultan in 1905.

Dr Mufti’s mother is Fathia Abdulkarim Ben Ali. His Paternal grandmother is Ghazala Usta Umar. His maternal grandmother is Fatma Hamad Ben Halim. He has 4 brothers: Abdul-Jawad, Fawzi, Salah and Mahmoud, and 5 sisters: Sarah, Mabroukah, Intisar, Eman and Ibtisam.
In 1968 Dr Mufti married Nita Nicholson, a painter and poet. They had two children: Hishaam Caramanli, born in Leeds (1968), and Sehaam Castelberg, born in Baida, Libya (1970).
After his divorce from Nita, Dr Mufti married Najat Rashid Kikhia in 1985, a professor of statistics at <a href="Benghazi%20University">Benghazi University</a>. They have three children: Fathia, Fatma and Ahmed.

Published work.
Medical Books.
Apart from his book on the Surgical Management of Hydatid Disease (1989), Dr Mufti, published the following books in English:
In addition, Dr Mufti published in Arabic three books on the historical Medical topics, namely "Eye and touches" on medieval Arabo-Islamic medical renaissance, "Modern Medicine, from practice to experimental Science" and "Silent Storms; On the History of Epidemics".
Arab Culture and the Challenge of Science.
During his detention as a political prisoner, Dr Mufti, with the help of his ex-wife (then working as a lecturer of English at <a href="Benghazi%20University">Benghazi University</a>) and other friends, had access to the endowed University library. His readings centered on the history of science and anthropology.
After release he wrote his seminal book "Assimilation of Science..First" (2003) in which he postulates that the dilemma of Arab culture emanates from its inability to assimilate modern science and to reinterpret Islamic percepts. Dr Mufti followed with two more books; "Obstacles to Assimilation of science" and "The structure of Arab Culture and the Crisis of Modernization"(2005). Democratic values, tolerance, dedication and objectivity are not instinctual but are by-products of the modern Scientific and Industrial Revolution. In those early books, Dr Mufti predicted the implosion of Arab regimes as indeed was the case following the so-called “<a href="Arab%20Spring">Arab Spring</a>”. Finally in this genre, Dr Mufti translated "On Aggression" (2007) by the Nobel Laureate <a href="Konrad%20Lorenz">Konrad Lorenz</a>.

Social History of Libya.
In the stale, even rancid culture that accompanies tyranny, active minds keep themselves busy or distracted. Under Gaddaafi, Libya kangarooed from one turmoil to another, from ridiculous antics and unnecessary hardships to the gruesome hangings in public squares, university campuses and basketball courts. In his relatively insular and estranged life, Dr Mufti took to writing on Libyan social history which had been undocumented and only passed orally from generation to the next. Here he relied on traditions, recording memories of the elderly as well as his own impressions, especially as a young doctor in the Bedouin environment of the <a href="Jebel%20Akhdar%2C%20Libya">Green Mountain</a>. His books are in collage-format to build mosaic tableaux, and as such enjoyed wide readership. The series includes "Chats in Benghazi", "Evening exchanges in Derna", "Tripolitanian Days", "Marj; a village beyond horizon" and "Mountain Illusions". These apparently innocent books are full of symbolism which was noticed by the dictatorship censors who at times imposed bans. Some were printed at the author’s expense abroad to be smuggled into the country.

Libyan Political History.
In an attempt to justify his historical works, Dr Mufti once said: “The curious tend to seek challenging tasks and follow unexplored terrain”. Indeed, many facets of Libyan political history had been officially out of bounds for over half a century. Dr Mufti’s researches and contemplations of Libya’s political history led him to write "A Country that inhabits us" (2007) which traced the tributaries of Libyan national identity over the last two centuries or so. Other books include; "Omar Mukhtar Association; Democratic Ambitions in a traditional Society", "Sadaawy & the Congress; Glorification and Oblivion", and "The Monarchy Time". In his book "Memory of Fire" (2012), Dr Mufti records a diary of events during the 2011 uprising that toppled the Gaddaafi regime.

Criticism.
During the first four years of freedom, Dr Mufti was attracted to the small group of Benghazi poets, painters and theatre groups. His fondness with documentation led him to put together in book form (2004), his conversations with his close friend, the courageous and prominent poet Mohamed Shultamy who had suffered much persecution himself. The title was originally "They Can’t dim Sunlight, it’s inside Me", but was reduced to a banal phrase by the censors. The following two books were "The Zalla Dates" (i.e. palm tree fruit) (2005) and "Dawameece" after the dug-in caves of Jebel Nafousah (2009). Both are collections of essays introducing avant-guard writers etc. A fourth book "Colour Nostalgia" (2006) dealt with the works of the Benghazi painter Awad Ubaidah.

Emotional support cat

An emotional support cat is a sub-category for cats that serve as <a href="Emotional%20support%20animal">Emotional support animal</a>, similar to the saying "emotional support dog". It is not an official word, but it is commonly used to describe a cat that serves as a person's ESA. Because the popularity of emotional support animals have increased over the past decade, sub-category descriptions have been adopted and accepted by the public. Lastly, an emotional support cat does not have any higher status than an ESA or a therapy animal or even a service animal.

Registering A Cat as an Emotional Support Animal.
The only requirement to have your cat certified as an Emotional Support Cat is to have a written letter (ESA prescription letter) from a licensed mental health professional such as a psychologist. There is also no such thing as an official registry for ESAs.


Laws & Rights.
There are three United States Federal Laws, including the <a href="https%3A//www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.pdf">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>, which primarily protect the rights of people with Emotional Support Animals. Although the rights are not as expansive as those granted to Service Animals or Service Dogs, there are still two very important points to acknowledge:

Smartphone Films

Smartphone Films are making through <a href="camera%20phone">camera phones</a> with enough video visual quality for theatrical performance or to preview on outside screens. These are also called as <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a> or cell phone movies. In this ultra-modern era of cinema, many filmmakers are competing each other to capture high quality visual effects with prestigious ultra high-definition digital cameras, a team of youngsters has come up with this new medium, which is perhaps quite strange to conceive, to shoot even full-length films.

In 2006, two Italian directors, Marcello Mencarini and Barbara Seghezzi, have reportedly scored a documentary using a mobile phone. This 93-minutes documentary film, "New Love Meetings", is said to be a modern version of <a href="Pier%20Paolo%20Pasolini">Pier Paolo Pasolini's</a> 1965 documentary film, <a href="Love%20Meetings">Love Meetings</a>. This new version was filmed in MPEG4 format with a mobile phone.

And, In 2007, the film, <a href="Why%20Didn%27t%20Anybody%20Tell%20Me%20It%20Would%20Become%20This%20Bad%20in%20Afghanistan">Why Didn't Anybody Tell Me It Would Become This Bad in Afghanistan</a> was launched by <a href="Cyrus%20Frisch">Cyrus Frisch</a>. The films is about a Dutch Afghan War veteran who recalls his experiences during the war and tells how he came to cope with them.

In 2008, the team of youngsters from <a href="India">India</a> repeated the success of this capture medium of film making. They made a 26-minute documentary film <a href="Veena%20Vaadanam">Veena Vaadanam</a> using a Nokia N70 mobile phone. This documentary develops through the conversation between <a href="Sathish%20Kalathil">Sathish Kalathil</a>, director and producer of the documentary and Sujith Aalungal, a painter giving insights into the evolution of different schools of art across the world.

The successful completion of <a href="Veena%20Vaadanam">Veena Vaadanam</a> has given them the confidence to launch another 'mobile phone film project'. In 2010, they launched a full-length movie fully shot through Nokia N95 mobile phone without outside-traditional film-camera lenses called <a href="Jalachhayam">Jalachhayam</a> directed by <a href="Sathish%20Kalathil">Sathish Kalathil</a>, which deals with the lives of two artists.

In 2011, another movie shot by Nokia N8 smartphone, called "Olive". The film narrates about "a little girl who transforms the lives of three people without speaking, directed by Hooman Khalili. Chris Kelly, former chief privacy officer at Facebook supplied its finance. But, the film was not shot with its original capture medium camera lens. The filmmakers of the film depended outside-traditional film camera lenses to capture the film.

In 2015, <a href="Tangerine%20%28film%29">Tangerine</a>, comedy-drama American film was produced by <a href="Sean%20Baker">Sean Baker</a>, Karrie Cox, Marcus Cox, Darren Dean, <a href="Shih-Ching%20Tsou">Shih-Ching Tsou</a> through iPhone 5s smartphone.

History.
Argentina and Cuba share a common history in the fact that both nations were once part of the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a>. In 1816, Argentina obtained its independence and in 1902, Cuba obtained its independence after the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>. On 12 May 1909, Argentina and Cuba officially established diplomatic relations. Initially, relations were limited between both nations due to their geographic distances.

In January 1959, Cuban revolutionary leader, <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a> entered Havana and took control of the country. After the revolution, Argentina maintained relations with the new Cuban government and in May 1959, Castro paid a visit to Argentina and met with Argentine President <a href="Arturo%20Frondizi">Arturo Frondizi</a>. In August 1961, Argentine born Cuban revolutionary commander, <a href="Che%20Guevara">Ernesto "Che" Guevara</a> secretly returned to Argentina for a few hours and met with President Arturo Frondizi and an aunt of his before leaving the country.

In December 1961, Cuba declared itself Marxist and socialist, and aligned with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. As a result, and by U.S. pressure, on 21 January 1962, Cuba was expelled from the <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a> (OAS) and by September 1962, the United States imposed a full <a href="United%20States%20embargo%20against%20Cuba">embargo</a> on Cuba. That same year, by U.S. insistence, Argentina and all <a href="Latin%20American">Latin American</a> nations (with the exception of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>) broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in an effort to isolate the Castro government.

On 28 May 1973, under President <a href="H%C3%A9ctor%20C%C3%A1mpora">Héctor Cámpora</a>, Argentina became the third nation (after <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="Peru">Peru</a>) to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba. Former Cuban President <a href="Osvaldo%20Dortic%C3%B3s%20Torrado">Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado</a> became ambassador to Argentina.

In October 1986, Argentine President <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Alfons%C3%ADn">Raúl Alfonsín</a> paid an official visit to Cuba, becoming the first Argentine President to do so. In 1995, Castro returned to Argentina to attend the 5th <a href="Ibero-American%20Summit">Ibero-American Summit</a> in <a href="Bariloche">Bariloche</a> where he met with Argentine President <a href="Carlos%20Menem">Carlos Menem</a>. Relations between both nations became tense when in 1997, during the 7th Ibero-American Summit in <a href="Margarita%20Island">Isla Margarita</a>, <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, President Menem called for democracy in Cuba and for the end of human rights violations on the island. In November 1999, President Menem declined to attend the 9th Ibero-American Summit being held in Havana.

Relations between Argentina and Cuba improved during the presidency of <a href="N%C3%A9stor%20Kirchner">Néstor Kirchner</a>. In 2003, Fidel Castro returned to Argentina to attend the inauguration of President Kirchner. Castro returned one last time to Argentina in 2006 to attend a <a href="Mercosur">Mercosur</a> summit in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Argentina">Córdoba</a>. In July 2006, Fidel's younger brother, <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Castro">Raúl Castro</a>, took over as acting President of Cuba and in 2008, Raúl became official President of Cuba. In 2009, Argentine President <a href="Cristina%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Kirchner">Cristina Fernández de Kirchner</a> paid a visit to Cuba and visited with both Fidel and Raúl Castro. President Fernández de Kirchner would re-visit Cuba in 2013.

In December 2015 <a href="Mauricio%20Macri">Mauricio Macri</a> became President of Argentina. In October 2016, Presidents Raúl Castro and Mauricio Macri met in <a href="Cartagena%2C%20Colombia">Cartagena, Colombia</a>; both leaders attending as witnesses to the signing of the peace treaty between the Colombian Government and the <a href="FARC">FARC</a>. During their reunion, both Presidents announced that the two governments hope to reach an agreement on Cuba's outstanding debt to Argentina of $11 billion USD from its original debt of $1.3 billion USD which Cuba borrowed in 1973 (plus unpaid interest).

Kékélé

Kekele was a band formed in 2000, composed of leading veteran African musicians, mostly from the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>. They played <a href="Congolese%20rumba">Congolese rumba</a> in a revival style harkening back to the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, using acoustic guitars. Kekele seems to be dormant or defunct, having not released a recording since 2006 nor performed since (apparently) 2010. 

Origins.
The African-record producer <a href="Ibrahim%20Sylla">Ibrahim Sylla</a> formed Kekele in 2000 to record its first album, "Rumba Congo". According to one report, the band was originally intended as a “one-off” effort, only meant to exist for that one album. The word "kekele" in the <a href="Lingala">Lingala</a> language means a type of fibrous vine, sometimes woven together to make rope. One writer speculated that this is a metaphor for the musicians who comprise the band.

The band's inspiring spirit was a dissatisfaction with the direction Congolese popular music had recently taken, and a desire to return to its roots. As Kekele guitarist Syran Mbenza said, "There were no more songs, no more melodies. . . . Our music was becoming decadent. We had to wake it up again."

As an effort by a group of older musicians to revive an older style of music, many writers compared this group's work to the <a href="Buena%20Vista%20Social%20Club">Buena Vista Social Club</a>, the 1990s Havana band and album. Perhaps along similar lines to the Buena Vista Social Club, Kekele seems aimed at a largely non-African target audience; Martin Sinnock, a U.K. expert in Congolese music, described Kekele's first album as "the most popular Congolese release of 2001" -- among those "[o]utside the African community," because African fans of Congolese music were more interested in other musicians such as <a href="Koffi%20Olomide">Koffi Olomide</a>.

Personnel.
As Kekele has recorded and toured, its membership, the ten to twenty musicians in the studio or on stage, has regularly changed. Each lineup, however, has consistently been an all-star cast of experienced musicians, most from the Democratic Republic of the Congo but some from elsewhere in Africa.

The consistent core members of Kekele include vocalists <a href="Nyboma">Nyboma</a> (Nyboma Mwan’dido), <a href="Wuta%20Mayi">Wuta Mayi</a>, <a href="Bumba%20Massa">Bumba Massa</a>, and <a href="Loko%20%E2%80%98Djeskain%E2%80%99%20Massengo">Loko ‘Djeskain’ Massengo</a>, and guitarist <a href="Syran%20Mbenza">Syran Mbenza</a>. Loko ‘Djeskain’ Massengo is from the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a>, while the other four are from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and all were between age 50 and 55 in 2001. These five core members of Kekele include three of the four "stars" who comprised the supergroup <a href="Les%20Quatre%20Etoiles">Les Quatre Etoiles</a> (The Four Stars): Nyboma, Wuta Mayi, and Syran Mbenza.

History: personnel changes, musical styles, critical reactions.
First album, "Rumba Congo" (2001).
The first iteration of Kekele was led by the older guitarist <a href="Papa%20Noel%20Nedule">Papa Noel Nedule</a> as music director, and included, in addition to the five core members named above, <a href="Jean-Papy%20Ramazani">Jean-Papy Ramazani</a> (vocals), <a href="Yves%20Ndjock">Yves Ndjock</a> of Cameroon (guitar), <a href="Sungu%20Debat">Sungu Debat</a> (conga), and <a href="Viviane%20Arnoux">Viviane Arnoux</a> of France (accordion). 

By contrast to the increasingly fast, electronic Congolese music of the 1990s, the album's musical style was a throwback, with slow rumba tempos, acoustic guitars, and accordion. Reviewers noted the high quality of the musicians and the slow, smooth nature of the music. For example, Mark Romano wrote, "Here is the full glory of Congolese rumba, played with style and an elegant sensuality that is without equal in the world of African music. . . . There is no filler here, only unguent guitar work, honey-laced vocals, piping-hot percussion, and tight fat horns." Christina Roden wrote, "The tunes uniformly reflect the languid yet well-marked Cuban clavé beat, chiming strings, and close-harmony vocals that characterized the older, more classic styles. There is not a single rough edge or hurried tempo within earshot. Ultimately, the project comes across as a mellifluous living history taught by those who know." Rock critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> wrote "As long on lilt as it is devoid of drive, the abiding quietude is irrelevant to an up-and-at-'em mood. But when nothing seems sweeter than home, it's a blessed comfort--the harmonies whispering, the drums twining, the groove massaging each overtaxed muscle until the blood can do its work there and flow on." 

The album was critically well-received. Christgau gave the record an A-, and Romano concluded "It would be difficult to top this recording for Congolese rumba album of the year or, for that matter, African album of the year."

Second album, "Congo Life" (2003).
Papa Noel was ill when the second Kekele album was recorded, and did not participate. He was replaced on guitar by <a href="Rigo%20Star">Rigo Star</a> Bamundélé. Ramazani and Ndjock also did not return for the second album.

Similar to the first album, the second featured acoustic guitars and slow conga rhythms. Differently, it added flute, clarinet, and violin. It includes a tribute to <a href="OK%20Jazz">OK Jazz</a>, "Souvenirs-OK-Jazz". Reviewers again focused on the record's beauty. John Armstrong, for BBC Music, described the album's "[d]elicious melodies, inspired and original arrangements, faultless and non-indulgent playing, scalp-tingling voices." The album's song composed by Rigo Star, "Oyibi Bien", was singled out by two reviewers as particularly outstanding.

Christgau preferred the first album over the second, but other reviewers felt differently. Rick Sanders of fRoots magazine wrote "here, a couple of years down the line, comes number two, an album that shows even more warmth, wit and soul than its predecessor." John Pareles wrote in the New York Times, "Kekele is an alliance of musicians who have played in some of Congo's best-known bands, and on "Congo Life" (World Music), they feature acoustic instruments -- guitars, woodwinds, marimbas -- in pristinely recorded soukous that's no less danceable for its gentle arrangements."

Third album, "Kinavana" (2006).
Papa Noel returned for the third album, on which Kekele was joined by saxophonist <a href="Manu%20Dibango">Manu Dibango</a>, from Cameroon, and singers <a href="Mbilia%20Bel">Mbilia Bel</a> and <a href="Madilu%20System">Madilu System</a>, both from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The title of the third album refers to an imaginary place, a combination of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of the Congo), and Havana (Cuba). The album explores the connections between Congolese and Cuban rumba music. In "Kinavana", the band takes songs written or performed by the Cuban songwriter <a href="Guillermo%20Portabales">Guillermo Portabales</a>, and plays them in a Congolese style, replacing their Spanish lyrics with <a href="Lingala">Lingala</a> ones.

Band member Nyboma has pointed out that Cuban rumba -- both the word and the dance -- derives from the Congolese "nkumba", with the Spanish "r" added to the word, and that it was brought from Congo to Cuba in the transatlantic slave trade. When Congolese rumba developed after World War II, it was heavily influenced by Cuban music. Thus, "Kinavasa" incorporates at least three successive cultural crossings of the Atlantic -- music and dance from Congo combining with other influences to become Cuban rumba, that same Cuban music then contributing to the Congolese rumba, and then bringing the music of Portabales into Congolese music for "Kinavasa". 

This album also received positive reviews. Norman Weinstein wrote for "All About Jazz": "This music sounds effortless, joyous, free of contrivance, and even for ears steeped mainly in jazz, intensely swinging. This is not just the best African album I've heard in years; it's superior to most of the world music releases that I've heard lately, from any place. What a case for how age can bring a perfect blend of musical seasonings."

Live performances.
Between their first concert tour, ten or eleven performances in the UK in November-December 2001, and what appears to be their most recent concert, a July 9, 2010 show at Bozar in Brussels, one source reports that Kekele toured the United States and Canada in summer 2004 and summer 2006, and Europe in summer 2005 and summer 2007, as well as performing in the Canary Islands, Reunion, Guadeloupe, the Dominican Republic, Morocco, and Congo Brazzaville. Additionally, their 2006 live album is described as being recorded "during Kekele's 2005 winter tour in Canada and the U.S."

Harley-Davidson: Wheels of Freedom

Harley-Davidson: Wheels of Freedom is a <a href="racing%20video%20game">racing game</a> developed by Canopy Games and G2M Games, and published by Infogrames in 2000.

Gameplay.
Building upon the earlier "Race Across America", "Harley-Davidson: Wheels of Freedom" lets players take part in various <a href="motorcycle%20rally">motorcycle rally</a> events across the United States. Events new to the game are checkpoint-based rally stages, similar to "<a href="Motocross%20Madness">Motocross Madness</a>" and "<a href="Midnight%20Club">Midnight Club</a>", along with a <a href="poker%20run">poker run</a> game mode where besides winning the race itself, the player has to have the best poker hand at the end of each run. As with earlier Harley-Davidson games, "Wheels of Freedom" employs a number of motorcycles from the company—models such as the <a href="Harley-Davidson%20FLSTF%20Fat%20Boy">Harley-Davidson Fat Boy</a> return, along with the addition of the <a href="Softail">Softail</a> Deuce, <a href="Harley-Davidson%20Super%20Glide">Dyna Wide Glide</a> and Night Train. In contrast to the linear, point-to-point stages in "Race Across America", "Wheels of Freedom" is open-ended in nature, allowing for players to explore the game's race courses in an <a href="open%20world">open world</a> environment and choose events at their own leisure.

Other improvements include the addition of the <a href="Havok%20%28software%29">Havok</a> physics engine with ragdoll physics and new character animations, making it possible for player character to bail out of his/her motorcycle upon colliding with scenery or an opponent. Also included is the integration of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s matchmaking service, allowing players to join or host multiplayer sessions more easily as opposed to the multiplayer component in the previous game which was criticized for being hard to use.

Reception.
The game was released to mixed reviews. Stephen Poole of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> said, "If you're looking for high-performance motorcycle racing on the PC, you'll tap this one out in very short order.". They awarded the game a score of 5.3 (mediocre). In a similarly mixed review, Vincent Lopez of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> noted the graphical improvements over the previous game, its open-ended structure and the inclusion of GameSpy Arcade, but criticized its erratic AI and easy diffuculty, saying "If, perhaps, you enjoy spending your money on things of value, such as say... well, any other game on the market, than you should probably take the twenty bucks and get yourself "<a href="Superbike%202001">Superbike 2001</a>", or at least something a little more valuable."

A more positive review came from Shawn Snider of GamingExcellence, who deemed it "a very large step up from its predecessor", yet noted the game's easy difficulty and poor vehicle handling.

Two Court Martials following her loss resulted in severe reprimands for her Captain, Commander Douglas C. Lang and Navigating Lieutenant, Geoffrey A. H.

Loss.
The minesweeper with the Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, Vice-Admiral Sir William Kelly aboard, ran ashore on the night of Wednesday 11 November 1931 on the north side of Tungyung Island while on a passage from Shanghai to Fuzhou, it was a total loss. The S.S. Derflinger and the Canadian Pacific liner <a href="RMS%20Empress%20of%20Asia">RMS Empress of Asia</a> went to the Petersfield's assistance, and the <a href="County-class%20cruiser">County-class cruiser</a>s <a href="HMS%20Suffolk%20%2855%29">Suffolk</a> and <a href="HMS%20Cornwall%20%2856%29">Cornwall</a> proceeded rapidly to the scene.

Iranian Huns

"This is translated from the German Wikipedia as of August 2017. Significant changes in italics."

The term Iranian Huns is "sometimes used" for a group of different tribes that lived in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and neighboring areas between the fourth and seventh centuries and expanded into northwest India. "They are roughly equivalent to the Indian <a href="Hunas">Hunas</a>." They also threatened the northeast borders of <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Persia</a> and forced the Shahs to lead many ill-documented campaigns against them.

The term was introduced by Robert Göbl in the 1960s and is based on his study of coins. The term has been generally accepted in research ("sic in the original article"). "The term "Iranian Huns" coined by Göbl has sometimes been accepted in research, as some of the namings and inscriptions, of the <a href="Kidarites">Kidarites</a> and <a href="Hephthalites">Hephthalites</a> in particular, used the Iranian language, and the bulk of the population they ruled was Iranian. It is nevertheless generally considered that these Huns were of <a href="Turco-Mongol">Turco-Mongol</a> origin." Recent research has added the Xionites as a fifth group. In recent research, it is debated whether the new arrivals came as one wave or several waves of different peoples. Göbl has four waves of Iranian Huns, partly simultaneous and partly sequential.

"Added to translation: The term "Iranian Huns" does not seem to appear in the usual English sources except for the Iranica. "Hun" is used in the broad sense and these people may have been partly non-Iranian. Until the spread of Islam and the re-appearance of the Chinese under the Tang about 700 AD, the sources for central Asian history are poor. Note that this and the linked articles sometimes contradict and the sources themselves sometimes contradict. Related to the Iranian Huns are the <a href="Uar">Uar</a>, <a href="Hunas">Hunas</a> and uncertain terms from various languages like "White Hun", "Red Hun" and others."

Outline.
"Much of this is uncertain and the sources sometimes contradict. The five groups were political or ethnic groups centered in Bactria and Afghanistan. After 350 the Xionites fought the Persians. The Kidarites probably arose from the Xionites, fought the Persians, invaded northern India and were defeated by the Persians about 467. The Alkhons were probably the Hunas who led a major invasion of northern India about 480-528. The Nezak lived around Kabul at the time of the Ephthalites. The Ephthalites were very powerful around 458-498 and were destroyed by the Persians and newly-arrived Gokturks about 560. Remnants disappeared after the Arab conquest circa 705."

Problems with sources and names.
The Iranian Huns are not to be confused with the <a href="Huns">Huns</a> proper, that is, Attilla’s people. Sources are very thin. We have a few written reports from <a href="Late%20antiquity">Late antiquity</a>, from China and from India where they are referred to as <a href="Hunas">Hunas</a>. Much of our information comes from the study of coins, of which many have been found. These coins raise many problems of chronology and interpretation. Furthermore, coins of the Iranian Huns cannot always be assigned to a definite ruler.

In the fourth century various central Asian tribes began to attack the Persian <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a>. The sources sometimes call these people 'Huns', but their origin is unclear. It is probable that they were not related to the Huns who appeared on the south Russian steppe about 375 and attacked the Roman Empire. The two terms should be clearly separated. Like 'Scythian', ‘Hun’ in its various forms was used loosely by ancient historians to refer to various steppe tribes of which they knew little. In modern research, it is often accepted that the term 'Hun' was often used, because of its fame, for various mixed groups and is not to be understood as the name of a concrete ethnic group.

Xionites.
The Xionites were not included in Robert Göbl's classification because they left no coinage. More recent research has found a connection between the Xionites and Göbl's first wave of Iranian Huns.

In 350 a group called the <a href="Xionites">Xionites</a> began to attack the Sassanid Empire. They conquered Bactria, but <a href="Shapur%20II">Shapur II</a> eventually defeated them. Later they allied with the Persians, participated in the Roman-Persian War and joined in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Amida">Siege of Amida</a> (359) under their king <a href="Grumbates">Grumbates</a>. Written reports come from <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a>, among others. The Middle Persian term Xyon seems to be related to both 'Xionite' and 'Hun'but does not imply that all groups with this name were related or ethnically homogenous. Among the Iranian Huns, except possibly the Xionites, we can recognize definite Iranian elements, notably the <a href="Bactrian%20language">Bactrian language</a> as an administrative language and coin inscriptions.

Kidarites.
Göbl’s first group were the <a href="Kidarites">Kidarites</a> who near the end of the fourth century were involved in the aftermath of the fall of the <a href="Kushan%20Empire">Kushan Empire</a> (after 225, see <a href="Kushano-Sasanian%20Kingdom">Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom</a>). Recent research has the Kidarites as a clan of the Xionites, or somehow derived from them so that the two groups cannot be strictly distinguished. Both groups appear as serious opponents of the Persians. <a href="Priscus">Priscus</a> said that the Sasanids fought 'Kidatite Huns'. This was probably at the time of <a href="Bahram%20V">Bahram V</a> (420-438) and certainly the time of <a href="Yazdegerd%20II">Yazdegerd II</a> (438-457). The Persians are known to have paid tribute to the Kidarites.

The name Kidarites comes from their first known ruler, <a href="Kidara%20I">Kidara</a> (circa 350-385). They made coins in imitation of the <a href="Kushano-Sasanian%20Kingdom">Kushano-Sasanids</a> who had previously ruled the area. Many coin-hordes have been found in the Kabul area which allows us to date the start of their rule to about 380. Kidarite coins found in Gondhara suggest that their rule sometimes extended into northern India. Their coins are inscribed in Bactrian, Sogdian and Middle Persian and in the <a href="Brahmi%20script">Brahmi script</a>.

Their power fell in the later fifth century. Their capital, Balkh, fell in 467 probably after a great victory of <a href="Peroz%20I">Peroz I</a> over their king Kunkhas. Their rule in Gondhara lasted until at least 477, for in that year they sent an embassy to the <a href="Northern%20Wei%20dynasty">Northern Wei dynasty</a>. They seem to have held out in Kashmir a little longer, and then all traces disappear. By this time the Hephthalites had established themselves in Bactria and the Alkhons had driven the Kidarites out of the land south of the Hindu Kush.

Alkhons.
The second wave was the <a href="Alchon%20Huns">Alkhons</a> who established themselves in the Kabul area around 400. Their history must be reconstructed almost exclusively from coin-hordes. Their coins are based on Sassanid models, probably because they took over the Persian mint at Kabul. The Bactrian word "Alxanno" is stamped on their coins, from which we derive the name "Alkhon". It is not clear whether this word means a tribe, or a ruler, or is a royal title.

Under their king <a href="Khingila">Khingila</a> (died about 490) they attacked Gondhara and drove out the Kidarites. Their following attacks on Indian princes seem to have been unsuccessful. In the early sixth century they expanded from Gondhara to northwest India and practically destroyed the rule of the <a href="Guptas">Guptas</a>, whose coins they imitated. This claim of an Alkhon invasion is based entirely on coin-finds since Indian sources call all of the northern invaders 'Hunas', including perhaps the Hephthalites. Under <a href="Toramana">Toramana</a> and his son <a href="Mihirakula">Mihirakula</a> (515-540/50?) they were especially aggressive. Mihirakula is portrayed negatively and is accused of persecuting Buddhists. Around the middle of the sixth century their power in north India broke down. Mihirakula suffered a serious defeat in 528 and thereafter his power was limited. His capital was <a href="Sialkot">Sakala</a> in Punjab which was once an important Indo-Greek center. After his death (550?) they stopped pressing their attacks. Despite its short duration the Huna invasion was politically and culturally devastating for India. Later some of the Alkhons seem to have returned to Bactria.

Nezak.
Göbl’s third wave were the <a href="Nezak%20Huns">Nezak Huns</a> who settled around Kabul. Early scholars called them 'Napki'. The exact chronology is unclear. The first written accounts come from the early seventh century. Some place their foundation in the late sixth century after the fall of the Hephthalites. The coins imply a foundation in the late fifth century.
If we accept the early dating they were under pressure from the Hephthalites, but by the later dating they profited from the Hephthalite collapse.

Their coins are strongly based on Sassanid models but are clearly recognizable by their distinctive bulls-head crowns which allow the coins to be divided into types. It seems that returning Alkhon groups met the Nizaks and produced an Alkhon-Nizak mixed language.

It is certain that they expanded to Gondhara and minted coins there. Chinese sources from the early seventh century prove that their capital was <a href="Kapisa">Kapisa</a>. Their remnants south of the Hindu Kush seem to have been destroyed by the Arab conquest in the late seventh century.

Hephthalites.
The fourth and most important wave were the <a href="Hephthalites">Hephthalites</a> who arrived in the mid fifth century. As with the other groups an exact chronology is difficult to establish. From later Perso-Arabic sources such as <a href="Al-Tabari">Al-Tabari</a> it appears that they were opponents of the Persians already in the first half of the fifth century, although the sources use the vague term “Turk”. The few reports of Greco-Roman authors, who often had little knowledge of events so far east, made little distinction between the different groups and it seems more probable that they referred to other Iranian Huns who arrived before the Hephthalites proper. They were called "White Huns" by <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a> who gives some information. Their coins are based on current Persian models.

To the end of the fifth century they had spread from eastern Tocharistan (Bactria) and brought several neighboring areas under control. They expanded not to India but to Transoxiana. The Hunas reported from Indian sources were probably Alkhons (see above). By the beginning of the sixth century they controlled a significant area in Bactria and Sogdia.

The Hephthalites had many conflicts with the Persians. In 484 <a href="Peroz%20I">Peroz I</a> fell in battle against the Hephthalites, who had defeated him before. In 498/99 they restored <a href="Kavadh%20I">Kavadh I</a> to the throne. The Persians seem to have paid tribute, at least some of the time. Among the Iranian Huns the Hephthalites were the most serious threat to the Persians. Syrian and Armenian sources report repeated Sassanid attempts to secure their northeast border which led to disaster for Peroz I who had previously defeated the Kidarites. According to <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a> they had an effective ruling system with a king at the top and, at least after the conquest of Bactria and Sogdia, were no longer nomads. They used <a href="Bactrian%20language">Bactrian language</a> as an administrative language and used the urban centers of their realm, notably Gorgo (location?) and Balkh.
Around 560 their realm was destroyed by an alliance of Persians and Gokturks. Hephthalite remnants lasted until the Arab conquest in the late seventh and early eighth centuries.

Club career.
Amalul was a career soldier who started playing league football in the <a href="2007-08%20season">2007-08 season</a> of the Brunei Premier League I with <a href="Royal%20Brunei%20Armed%20Forces%20Sports%20Council">Royal Brunei Armed Forces Sports Council</a>. The Armymen finished runners-up to <a href="QAF%20FC">QAF FC</a> in the league in his first season there, but won the FA Cup instead. On 17 April 2010, Amalul opened the scoring against eventual league winners QAF at the 2010 DST FA Cup final which MS ABDB won 2–1, the winner scored by <a href="Rosmin%20Kamis">Rosmin Kamis</a>.

Amalul's impressive league form led to an invite to train with royalty-owned <a href="Brunei%20DPMM%20FC">Brunei DPMM FC</a> in preparation for the <a href="2012%20S.League">2012 S.League</a>, where elder brother <a href="Shahrazen%20Said">Shahrazen</a> was currently playing. He signed full terms in February 2012, on the same day as his younger brother <a href="Adi%20Said">Adi</a>.

Although Adi progressed well at DPMM, it was the reverse for Amalul who endured a tough spell at the club, primarily unable to displace <a href="Subhi%20Abdilah%20Bakir">Subhi Bakir</a> at his preferred right-back role. His first (and only) appearance in 2012 was as a late substitute against <a href="Gombak%20United">Gombak United</a> on 31 August which finished 1–1. He went through 2013 without playing a single game, but managed to register four appearances in the first half of the <a href="2014%20S.League">2014 S.League</a> under new head coach <a href="Steve%20Kean">Steve Kean</a>. He made the first eleven in the 6–1 win against <a href="Young%20Lions%20FC">Young Lions</a> on 6 April, which would ultimately be his only start for DPMM. Another season without any appearances followed, and Amalul was released in early 2016 after failing <a href="S.League">S.League</a>'s mandatory fitness test.

Amalul joined <a href="Kota%20Ranger%20FC">Kota Ranger FC</a> later that year. The team is currently unbeaten in the <a href="2017%20Brunei%20Super%20League">2017 Brunei Super League</a>.

International career.
Amalul played for Brunei under-20s at the <a href="2005%20AFF%20U-20%20Youth%20Championship">2005 AFF U-20 Youth Championship</a> that was held in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. Three years later, he made his senior international debut at the <a href="2008%20AFC%20Challenge%20Cup%20qualification">2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualifying</a>. He was a second-half substitute in a 0–1 loss against the home side, the <a href="Philippines%20national%20football%20team">Philippines</a>.

Amalul was left out of the Brunei squad for the <a href="2012%20AFF%20Championship%20qualification">2012 AFF Suzuki Cup qualifying</a> campaign, which was Brunei's first international outing in three years after enduring a <a href="Brunei%20national%20football%20team%23Suspension">FIFA suspension</a>. He was included in the <a href="2014%20AFF%20Championship%20qualification">2014 edition</a> however, and made two substitute appearances against <a href="Myanmar%20national%20football%20team">Myanmar</a> and <a href="Cambodia%20national%20football%20team">Cambodia</a>, both on the losing side.


Personal life.
Amalul's elder brothers <a href="Shahrazen%20Said">Shahrazen</a> and <a href="Ahmad%20Hafiz%20Said">Ahmad Hafiz</a> are Brunei international footballers, as well as younger brother <a href="Adi%20Said">Adi</a>. Together they have amassed 52 caps for Brunei.

Fiat Pininfarina Cabriolet

The <a href="Fiat%201200%23Fiat%201200%20Spyder">1200 Spyder</a> was replaced in 1959 by the <a href="Pininfarina">Pininfarina</a>-designed Fiat 1200 Cabriolet (tipo 118G). This continued to be built after the saloon on which it was based was replaced, although the engines were updated. Production ended in 1966, when replaced by the <a href="Fiat%20124%20Sport%20Spider">Fiat 124 Sport Spider</a>. Sporting versions (1500 S/1600 S) were equipped with <a href="O.S.C.A.">OSCA</a> built <a href="twin%20cam">twin cam</a> engines. Out of 34,211 Coupés and Spiders built, 3089 were OSCA-engined. The cars were built by Pininfarina, with engines and chassis supplied by Fiat.

First generation.
Pininfarina had shown a similar, OSCA-powered convertible called the Fiat-OSCA 1500 GT at the 1958 <a href="Turin%20Motor%20Show">Turin Motor Show</a>. Production models received the same 1221 cc <a href="OHV">OHV</a> engine as the earlier 1200 TV Trasformabile/Spider, albeit somewhat more powerful, with . The two-seat 1200 Cabriolet also retained the chassis of the 1200 TV Trasformabile. Front suspension is independent with coil and wishbone, combined with a live, leaf sprung rear axle.

1500 S/1600 S.
The 1200 was not fast enough to be considered a sports car, so Fiat decided to take a short cut to this market by using <a href="O.S.C.A.">OSCA</a>'s existing <a href="twin%20cam">twin cam</a> engine design. Chief engineer <a href="Dante%20Giacosa">Dante Giacosa</a> initated Fiat's relationship with OSCA in a July 1957 meeting with <a href="Ernesto%20Maserati">Ernesto Maserati</a>. In November 1959 the 1500 Cabriolet appeared with this 1491 cc engine, fitted with twin Weber carburettors and developing . The Tipo 118 engine was a close relative of the tipo 372 DS unit fitted to the OSCA's MT4 racing car (as well as the later road-going OSCA 1600 GT2 and SP), although Fiat took over production at their Mirafiori factory - now with a cast-iron rather than the original aluminium block. OSCA bought engines built by Fiat for their own purposes, and fettled those units further. The new model was called the Fiat 1500 Cabriolet (tipo 118S) and received a wider (non-functional) air scoop on the bonnet, a rev counter, as well as the larger drum brakes from the larger <a href="Fiat%201800%20and%202100">1800/2100</a> saloons, and 15-inch wheels. In July 1960 the name was changed to "Fiat 1500 S Cabriolet," and it now had <a href="disc%20brake">disc brake</a>s up front. About 1000 of the OSCA-engined 1500/1500 S models were built.

In mid-1962 this engine was replaced with one bored out by 2 mm to 1568 cc. The twin-cam four of the 1600 S (tipo 118SA) had (100 hp SAE). These cars received a distinctive, assymmetric air intake until 1963 when the 1600 S was facelifted while the 1200 was replaced by the <a href="pushrod">pushrod</a>-engined 1500 Cabriolet.

In 1960 Pininfarina presented a coupé version of the 1500 Cabriolet. This model, built in small numbers and sold by Pininfarina themselves, received a smaller windscreen as well as a shortened bootlid to accommodate the larger rear windshield. It remained a strict two-seater and continued to be built with the 1600 engine and after the range was facelifted in 1963. Fiat also offered a removable hardtop for the Cabriolets.

Second generation.
In 1961 the <a href="Fiat%201200">1200 Saloon</a> was replaced by the new, larger, <a href="Fiat%201300%20and%201500">1300/1500</a>. The 1200 and 1600 Coupés and Cabriolets continued to be built without major alterations until September 1963, when they became equipped with the larger 1.5 litre pushrod engine. Power was up to (80 SAE) and the 1500 (tipo 118H) now also benefitted from front disc brakes. The grille, previously in two segments, was now a wider single-piece unit of a more trapezoidal design. The Fiat-engined 1500 (tipo 118H) was now also available with Pininfarina's limited production coupé bodywork. The <a href="O.S.C.A.">O.S.C.A.</a> engined 1600 S, with a twin cam 1568 cc engine developing continued to be available albeit with the same new front end treatment as that of the 1500 Cabriolet. This was called the Fiat 1600 S Coupé/Cabriolet (tipo 118SB) and can easily be recognized by its additional lamps at the outer corners of the grille. New, lower engine mounts allowed the bonnets to be flatter.

In early 1965, the four-speed transmission was replaced with a closer spaced five-speed unit, while the brakes received servo assistance. The 1500 became the tipo 118K, along with a slight engine upgrade for (83 SAE). The range was replaced by the new <a href="Fiat%20124">124</a> coupés and spiders in 1966, although the 1500 Coupé continued to be sold into 1967.

2017 West Bengal floods

Following heavy rain in July and August 2017, the Indian state of <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a> was affected by severe flooding. The floods were reported to have caused 50 deaths since 1 August and 8 deaths in the neighbouring state of <a href="Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a>.
Soon after these floods, North Bengal also witnessed floods that wrecked havoc over the seven districts and killed 3 people.

Cause and extent of the disaster.
Gangetic West Bengal.
Heavy rain in last week of July resulted in flood in the state. The Land Depression 01 in its precursor low caused dangerous floods in <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a>.

State irrigation minister said that in some districts of south Bengal, there had been around 400 mm rainfall during the last three days.The rivers Silabati in West Midnapore, Darakeswar in Bankura, Dwaraka and Kuye in Birbhum were flowing above the danger level.Some villages at Suri block II got flooded due to incessant rain. Some parts of the Hooghly and West Midnapore, including Ghatal, Khirpai, Chandrakona went under water since Saturday night. Bankura recorded the state’s highest rainfall at 274 mm during the same period, while Digha recorded 104 mm and Burdwan received 72.6 mm of rains.The water discharge from DVC dams was in excess of that in 1978 which saw an unprecedented flood in the state. So far 2.78 lakh cusecs of water had been discharged by DVC as of 1st August. The situation in Bengal got worse on Thursday after Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) released more water from its dams and sounded a red alert in the lower catchment areas of the Damodar river.

An additional 2,49,450 cusecs of water was released from Durgapur barrage on Thursday morning. As a result, more areas in east Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah were hit by flood. The flood affected districts had received record rainfall from July 20 to 25. Compared to the normal rainfall received in July, Bankura received 754 per cent, Burdwan 334 per cent, Birbhum 313 per cent, East Midnapore 500 per cent, West Midnapore 424 per cent, Howrah 427 per cent, Hooghly 359 per cent, Kolkata 367 per cent, Murshidabad 174 per cent, and Purulia 721 per cent more rainfall. The cumulative rainfall received in Birbhum from July 20 to 26 was over 600 mm.

From the weather system, the capital city of Kolkata received 142 mm of rain in 48 hours. July 2017 was the second wettest in Kolkata since 2008 with rain count 72% above the normal mark – the city received 621.5 mm rain. Only once — in 2015 — in the last decade has Kolkata received more rain in July from <a href="Cyclone%20Komen">Cyclone Komen</a>.
North Bengal.
These floods in Gangetic West Bengal were soon followed by floods in North Bengal that affected 7 districts.These floods were caused by the shifting of the monsoon trough in the sub-himalayan region.

Floods effects.
Gangetic West Bengal.
Dhaniakhali of <a href="Hooghly%20district">Hooghly district</a> and Ghatal in <a href="West%20Midnapore%20district">West Midnapore district</a> were the two worst affected areas. 1,79,321 hectares out of 10,82,285 hectares of paddy seedbeds were damaged.At least 50 people died while nearly 20 lakh were affected in over 160 villages, which were inundated due to heavy rains. 2,301 people were evacuated from their houses and 2,02,957 hectare of agricultural land was submerged. Around 7,868 houses were entirely destroyed while 44,361 were partially damaged in <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a>. The state lost around Rs.553 crores(USD $86.6 million) due to the storm.An additional eleven people were reported to be killed in <a href="Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a> due to heavy rains.

Around 50 people have so far lost their lives, and according to government figures, about 11,974 hectares of land under paddy cultivation, and 23,096 hectare under vegetable cultivation, has been inundated. State government officials said the Subarnarekha river burst its banks after water was released from the Galudi dam in Jharkhand. Water was also released from Tilpara barrage in Birbhum. As a result, the Mayurakshi river inundated hundreds of acres of farmland. Water was reported to be rising fast in Chandrabhaga, Kopai and Bakreswar rivers in Birbhum district. In Hooghly district, embankments along the Darakeswar river were washed away and flood water gushed towards Arambagh town. In the 14 flood-hit districts in West Bengal, 27 lakh people had been affected by flood. The government had set up 311 relief camps where over 47,000 people have taken shelter, adding it has also set up 131 medical camps. Over 16,000 animals were sheltered in relief camps for animals and veterinary doctors were looking after them. The government had also sent medicines, water pouches and other items to all the districts.
North Bengal.
The floods claimed seven lives so far in the region, while about one lakh people were affected in the five districts—60,000 of them in Alipurduar and Jalpaiguri alone —and many of them had taken shelter in the relief camps.Communication between Falakata and Madarihat in Jalpaiguri district remained cut off due to large-scale inundation and a majority of the residents of the two areas had taken shelter in the relief camps.

Relief and rescue.
More than 27,00,000 people in 106 blocks of 14 districts of West Bengal were affected by the flood. Around 311 relief camps were opened for them by the state government.Chief minister <a href="Mamata%20Banerjee">Mamata Banerjee</a> visited flood-hit areas in Amta and Udaynarayanpur in Howrah. She accused the DVC of releasing water indiscriminately.The <a href="Mamata%20Banerjee">Mamata Banerjee</a> government sought help from the armed forces for the first time when eight districts in south Bengal were hit by flood.

SLM Solutions Group AG

SLM Solutions Group AG, headquartered in <a href="L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a>, Germany, is a manufacturer of 3D metal printers listed on the stock market and co-owner of the word mark "SLM". The abbreviation SLM stands for the manufacturing process Selective Laser Melting. The shares of SLM Solutions Group AG have been listed in <a href="Prime%20Standard">Prime Standard</a> of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since May 9, 2014.

Products and applications.
A variety of "Selective Laser Melting" machines with laser outputs from 100 to 2800 Watt are sold, the latter distributed on four lasers. According to manufacturer specifications, the top model is the currently (April 2014) highest-performing metal 3D printer on the market and cost approximately 1.5 million euros. The devices are able to machine different materials such as 
<a href="Aluminium">Aluminium</a>, <a href="Steel">Steel</a>, <a href="titanium">titanium</a> and <a href="Inconel">Inconel</a>. The maximum size of the manufactured components is 125 × 125 × 75 <a href="Millimeter">mm</a> to 500 × 280 × 325  mm. depending on the model.

A main advantage of 3D printing is that parts with complex geometries can be manufactured in only "one operation". This makes this method is particularly interesting for <a href="Rapid%20Prototyping">Rapid Prototyping</a> and small series, but also for the production of series production in the aerospace engineering where weight-saving plays a big roll. For example, you can achieve this by cavities or pores in the workpiece.
Further areas of application for SLM Solutions printers are energy technology (e.g., turbine parts), automotive engineering and medical technology (e.g., for implants). 

In addition to the laser melting equipment, SLM Solutions Group AG also sells conventional casting systems for rapid prototyping. This business area accounts for a smaller, decreasing sales share.

History.
Between 1996 and 1998, the companies"F & S Stereolithografietechnik GmbH" (Fockele & Schwarze), "Trumpf GmbH" and the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology began with initial research on laser fusion processes. After the founding of a European Technology Center for rapid prototyping in <a href="Kaarst">Kaarst</a> (Germany), the British "Mining and Chemical Products Ltd." (MCP) introduced the technique of selective laser melting while Fockele & Schwarze received various <a href="patent">patent</a>s in this area.

F & S and MCP formed a partnership and jointly developed marketable SLM devices. MCP was a pioneer in the laser processing of aluminum and titanium. The equipment was developed and manufactured at the subsidiary "HEK GmbH" in Lübeck. In the wake of corporate restructuring at MCP, this company division headed by Hans-Joachim Ihde was spun off in 2008 into "MTT Technologies GmbH" – later "SLM Solutions GmbH" —founded in 2006 and sold to Mr. Ihde and Henner Schöneborn. Both are still (as May 2014) involved in SLM Solutions Group AG.

<a href="ING%20Groep">ING Groep</a> also participated in SLM via its fund Parcom Germany I and acquired more than half of the shares. In preparation for the planned <a href="IPO">IPO</a>, the company was integrated into the newly founded SLM Holding GmbH, which was renamed "SLM Solutions Group AG" in 2014.

Consequently, the formal foundation year of the company is 2014, while the origins of the company go back to the 1990s. In a self-representation, it even goes back to the setting up of a Bolivian bismuth mine in the 1860s. The securities prospectus for the IPO cites 2006 as the foundation date of the operating company.
Within the context of the IPO in May 2014, the SLM Solutions Group AG netted €75 million by issuing new shares. At the same time, the existing shareholders – mainly Parcom – sold shares at the quoted value of €105 million. The sale of old shares at a quoted value of 103 to 163 million euros was planned.
Key strategic partnerships were concluded in the year 2016. 
In the area of application software, SLM Solutions Software GmbH was founded together with the Austrian CADS GmbH from Perg in February 2016. The common goal is the development of software that facilitates the optimal design of components for additive manufacturing.
In addition, 3D Metal Powder GmbH was entered in the commercial register on July 14, 2016 with the objective of supplying custom-tailored consumable material for the respective customer applications.

Business and financial position.
In the years prior to the IPO, SLM Solutions experienced growing demand for 3D printers and correspondingly strong growth. The following table shows some key business figures:
<nowiki>*</nowiki> EBITDA adjusted for "one-time expense" as specified by the company; EBIT according to the profit and loss account, adjusted for depreciation from the purchase price allocation

<nowiki>**</nowiki> Including €8.4 M expenses in connection with the IPO
Company management.
The two members of the Executive Board were only hired by SLM Solutions Group AG in 2013. 
Uwe Bögershausen is an economist, worked as a consultant and took aleo solar AG and Derby Cycle AG public as Chief Financial Officer. Both companies have been taken over in the meantime and are no longer listed on the stock exchange.
Henner Schöneborn acquired a degree in technical business administration in addition to a degree as a mechanical engineer. Before joining SLM solutions, he worked as a product manager at the Stuttgart company for tool machine technology Hahn & Kolb. He has many years of industry experience in the field of metal-based manufacturing technologies.

Circle of shareholders.
Since the IPO, a good 55% of the shares are held in widespread shareholdings The remaining shares are mostly to be found in the possession of the co-founder and supervisory board chairperson Hans Joachim Ihde and Parcom.

Background.
A singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist since the age of 14, Nova set out on a path to achieve her dream at 17, when she left her native Costa Rica, and moved to the "big city" (Spanish: "gran ciudad") of Los Angeles, CA, where she lives to this day, having only moved back to Costa Rica for a year in 2013.

It was her experiences as an immigrant in LA, the search for herself, and every situation that one encounters in an unknown place, that inspired her to write all 11 songs included on the album.

On her official website, she said the record was written about taking the first steps towards achieving your dreams, without caring about what others say; a moment in which a superhuman force dictates your destiny and makes you travel to those things you yearn.

Nova stated in an interview that the trip marked her life, especially the first years, where she was in search of her own voice and had the opportunity to work with <a href="S%C3%A9rgio%20Mendes">Sergio Mendes</a>, citing what happens when one leaves home, the feelings of loneliness, and of freedom, as being key aspects that inspired her to write the album.

Reception.
In his review for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, David R. Adler states "Like much of what Iyer creates under his own name, this music has the distinction of being toe-tappingly accessible and yet, on a technical level, nearly incomprehensible. It is a highly specialized language, to be sure, but also an endlessly refreshing one."

The "<a href="JazzTimes">JazzTimes</a>" review by Aaron Steinberg notes "Fieldwork's musicians have absorbed the highly rhythmic, dryly funky style that came out of the M-Base school and have adapted it to a cutting modern acoustic jazz setting. What sets Fieldwork apart, however, is the trio’s fervent and unwavering embrace of rhythm and attack."

The <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a> review by Dan McLenaghan states ""Your Life Flashes" sounds foreign and familiar and avant-garde and mainstream all at the same time."

François Raguenet

François Raguenet (c.1660 in <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a> – 1722) was a French historian, biographer and <a href="musicologist">musicologist</a>.

Biography.
Raguenet embraced the ecclesiastical state, and became preceptor of <a href="Marie%20Anne%20Mancini">Marie Anne Mancini</a>, <a href="cardinal%20de%20Bouillon">cardinal de Bouillon</a>'s niece. This position, leaving him the leisure to cultivate his taste for letters, he distinguished himself in the competitions of the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20fran%C3%A7aise">Académie française</a> and obtained, in 1685, an accessit by a discourse on the subject, "De la patience et du vice qui lui est contraire" ("On patience and the vice that is contrary to it"). Two years later, he won the prize in a speech entitled "Sur le mérite et l’utilité du martyre" ("On the merit and use of martyrdom").

Encouraged by this first success, he published the "Vie de <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Cromwell</a>", which was well received. In 1698, abbott Raguenet followed Cardinal de Bouillon at Rome and for two years studied the masterpieces of the arts which decorate the palaces and churches of the capital of the Christian world. The description he gave of it, shortly after his return to Paris, earned him the "letters from the Roman citizen", a title which flattered him greatly, and which he afterwards added to his name.

During his stay in Rome, he became passionate about Italian music, of which he had acquired a good knowledge. He undertook to demonstrate its superiority over the sad psalmody of the likes of <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Lully</a> and <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Campra">Campra</a>, but the partisans of French singing could not forgive him for having ridiculed the objects of their worship. His writings on musical life in Italy sparked a quarrel between French and Italian music, notably with his compatriot <a href="Jean-Laurent%20Le%20Cerf%20de%20La%20Vi%C3%A9ville">Jean-Laurent Le Cerf de La Viéville</a>, who strongly criticized this work. There was then a war as terrible as that excited later by the first appearance of <a href="Opera%20buffa">Opera buffa</a>s, or the rivalry between <a href="Christoph%20Willibald%20Gluck">Gluck</a> and <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Piccinni">Piccinni</a>.

Abbott Raguenet had the good sense to go away from the storm. He left Paris at the end of his life and died in the retreat he had chosen. He wrote a biography of <a href="Henri%20de%20la%20Tour%20d%27Auvergne%2C%20Vicomte%20de%20Turenne">vicomte de Turenne</a> by the order and before the eyes of Cardinal de Bouillon, who had taught him several interesting peculiarities.

Mauro Libi Crestani

Mauro Libi Crestani (1968—) is a <a href="Venezuela">Venezuelan</a> businessman and owner of the <a href="food%20distribution">food distribution</a> company Avenas Inproceca. He is either an owner, major shareholder, or holds some other controlling position in over 30 companies across three continents. The "Financial Times" described him in 2017 as a "self-described 'visionary' [who] has built a remarkable business empire over the past two decades."

Libi's story is extraordinary considering that Venezuela, which is where Libi built his fortune, is a country "better known for shortages of basic goods, obscure business dealings and revolutionary confrontation rather than wealth creation."

Early life.
Mauro Libi Crestani was born in <a href="Caracas">Caracas</a>, Venezuela. His pathway into <a href="entrepreneurship">entrepreneurship</a> was inspired by his father. His father was a businessman in the transportation industry but eventually created a food industry business.

When he was 16 years old, Libi went to Milan, Italy to study management. When he returned, he worked in his father's food business.

Libi "made his mark as a food importer and entrepreneur" beginning in the early 2000s. That was the same time period that coincided with <a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Hugo Chávez</a> being in power in Venezuela.

Avenas Inproceca.
Crestani serves as the president of Avenas Inproceca. The company processes and distributes 24 oat products throughout Venezuela. Approximately 1,400 people work at the company. Its premium <a href="oatmeal">oatmeal</a> brand is called Avelina.

In 2012, Crestani set an ambitious goal of getting 30 percent of the oats market in Venezuela. He opened a new oat processing plant in <a href="Guatire">Guatire</a>, a city in <a href="Miranda%20%28state%29">Miranda</a>, Venezuela.

Before running Avenas Inproceca, Crestani started his business career in 1996 when he was 26 years old. His first job was in his father's company overseeing 33 employees.

Controversial issues.
Libi has been accused of corruption and has been investigated by several government bodies. He was exonerated by the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Venezuela%29">Venezuela National Assembly,</a> the country's legislative branch, in late 2016. The original complaint had been filed by a political and social enemy: a <a href="Chavism">Chavista</a> group.

The Venezuelan government is "riddled with corruption rackets operated by officials with a vested interest in regime survival." Some accusations are even aimed at President <a href="Nicol%C3%A1s%20Maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a>'s cabinet.

The current level and system of corruption came to rise alongside Chávez's revolution and rise to power. Chávez used revenues from oil sales to finance his revolution. Unfortunately, that extraordinary amount of money provided people who had access to government or the oil industry with many opportunities for fraud. For example, in 2013, Bariven (a subsidiary of the state oil company) spent $2.3 billion on food imports; only one-fourth of the food it bought ever made it to Venezuela.

Allegations against Libi.
When asked, Libi told "<a href="Financial%20Times">The Financial Times</a>" in July 2017 that the allegations against him were false and that they were an attempted <a href="smear%20campaign">smear campaign</a>, to which the newspaper agreed to the possibility that Libi was telling the truth: "[the allegations] are perhaps inevitable given the public rage over the rampant state-sanctioned corruption that explains many of Venezuela's problems today."

Against the backdrop of the system of corruption within Venezuela, Libi has become a target for corruption allegations. An online campaign called "Escrache" has attempted to prove corruption charges against Libi and a host of other successful business owners.

In August 2016, the Audit Commission, a body within the Venezuela National Assembly, investigated Libi's business activities based on a "dossier compiled by Socialist Tide, a splinter chavista group." On October 5, 2016, Libi appeared before the commission to defend himself. By December 7, the commission closed its investigation.

Table source:

Libi kept factories open during massive food shortage.
While other factory owners shut down during the <a href="Crisis%20in%20Venezuela%20%282012%E2%80%93present%29">Crisis in Venezuela (2012–present)</a>, Libi stayed open. He kept his factories running and the employees working.

Libi is not a government official. Rather, he is a private citizen who holds ownership or partial ownership of a number of companies. 

Many of those companies do significant business with the <a href="Government%20of%20Venezuela">federal government of Venezuela</a> because of the way the country's economy works. He owns companies in the food industry that have received large government contracts whereby the government buys the product in very large quantities. The contracts bring the food to the government, which then goes to supply Venezuelans with oat products. Venezuela is no different than other nations: it buys goods and services that the government is not able to do or produce. Additionally, in Venezuela, there is not enough cash to import enough food products, including oats (the key product in Libi's companies' products).

While the country's economic conditions and serious malnutrition and foot shortage issues as of early August 2017 were deteriorating rapidly, and many factory owners--many of whom are successful and wealthy--have fled the nation, Libi chose to stay. 

In a country that does not produce many economic winners, Libi stands out. 

As "The Financial Times" put it: "Mr Libi remains upbeat. He gives parties in Miami. "His oatmeal business has pummeled the famous <a href="Quaker%20Oats%20Company">Quaker oats</a> brand made locally to win a 65 per cent market share". He even claims to be exporting oatmeal to the US."

Philanthropy.
In 2008, Crestani launched a foundation to help kids "in response to an influx of children living on the streets of <a href="Vargas%20%28state%29">Vargas</a>." The foundation, the Casa Hogar Foundation, pays for housing, school, and medical care. Since its founding, it has served 146 children.

The background for the need for the foundation lies in a 1999 <a href="Mudflow">mudslide</a> known as the "<a href="Vargas%20tragedy">Vargas tragedy</a>." According to "Latin Business Daily", "Vargas suffered what many believe was Venezuela’s worst natural disaster in 1999, when a mudslide killed an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 there. The community never recovered economically."

Additionally, Libi began to sponsors a cycling team in 2016. The team, which competes in both amateur and professional events, through an official sponsorship by Avelina, a product made by his company Inproceca. He began sponsoring the team in 2016.

Reception.

The "<a href="JazzTimes">JazzTimes</a>" review by Mike Shanley notes "Tension and suspense are two key qualities on "Door": a gargled alto sax squawk lurking in the distance, stop-start beats played on the rims of the snare and bassy piano lines played in the low register more than make up for the trio’s lack of the stringed instrument."

The <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a> review by Troy Collins states "A truly singular post-modern hybrid that draws equally from M-Base rhythms, Braxtonian structural theory and stark minimalism, "Door" is the formidable trio's most expansive and challenging recording to date."

The Triple Portrait of a Goldsmith is a c.1530 oil on canvas painting by <a href="Lorenzo%20Lotto">Lorenzo Lotto</a>, now held in the <a href="Kunsthistorisches%20Museum">Kunsthistorisches Museum</a> in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. It has previously been attributed to other artists such as <a href="Titian">Titian</a> until documentary evidence was found linking it to a painting of the same description in various collection inventories. In 1627 it was in the collection of <a href="Vincenzo%20II%20Gonzaga">Vincenzo II Gonzaga</a>, who sold it to <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">Charles I of Great Britain</a>, upon whose execution it was auctioned to <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Spain">Philip IV of Spain</a>. It eventually entered the Habsburg collections in Austria via inheritance - inventories show it has been in Vienna since at least 1733.

Influenced by existing medieval examples of triple portraits and by a lost triple portrait of <a href="Cesare%20Borgia">Cesare Borgia</a> by <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> (and itself an influence on the 1635-36 "<a href="Charles%20I%20in%20Three%20Positions">Charles I in Three Positions</a>" by van Dyck), it shows the same man face on, in profile and from behind, all half-length. He is dressed in dark clothes, wears a ring on his right hand and in the front-on portrait holds a small object. That object was barely visible before restoration and had previously been interpreted as a 'lotto' or pack of cards, punning on the painter's surname. The painting was restored for a 1953 exhibition, demonstrating that the object was instead a ring-box, suggesting the subject was a goldsmith.

Further study has linked the subject with the goldsmith Bartolomeo Carpan, a friend of Lotto's and mentioned in the painter's "Libro di spese diverse" from <a href="1538">1538</a> onwards. No other documents support the theory, but if it is correct the "tre visi" or "three faces" of the portrait may be a pun on Carpan's hometown, <a href="Treviso">Treviso</a>.

Queen (Fine Foods)

Queen Fine Foods is Australia's leading producer of pure vanilla extracts, food colourings, and baking aids.

Queen Vanilla was named after Queen Victoria, and was endorsed by her Majesty.

History.
In 1897, Queen Street, Brisbane pharmacist Edward Taylor, created a range of extracts, including Vanilla. He and partner Mr Colledge formed the Queen brand, and they began to win awards for their Vanilla and other flavourings.

By the 1920s, the Queen Vanilla range was sold in hand made glass bottles.

The company was purchased by the Himstedt family in 1978.

Queen's manufacturing facility was established in Alderley, Brisbane during the 1980s. It was between 2000-2010, that the company established strong ties with the Vanilla farmers, and provided education, training, and funding in vanilla producing countries, in particular Papau New Guinea.

By 2014, Queen was also providing funding, equipment and education to Vanilla farmers in Vava'u, Tonga, and Madagascar.

Queen is now the top selling brand of fine foods in Australian supermarkets, and is Queensland's longest selling food brand.

Fred Himstedt is the Manager Director, with his sons Fred, Sam, and Tom holding key positions in the company.

<doc id="54840244" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54840244" title="Review bomb">
Review bomb

A review bomb is an <a href="Internet">Internet</a> phenomenon in which large groups of people leave negative <a href="User%20review">user reviews</a> for <a href="Video%20game">video games</a> and other products in an attempt to harm their sales and popularity. This is often done in response to an actual or perceived slight towards customers by the creator or publisher of a game, such as anti-consumer gameplay changes or insults, in an attempt to force them to listen when other attempts have failed. However, in some cases, it is simply done as a means of <a href="coercion">coercion</a> or <a href="Internet%20troll">trolling</a>.

The increasing prevalence of review bombing was precipitated by the increase in influence of online user reviews in the main storefronts where games are sold, combined with little to no oversight of the content of these reviews. This is particularly true in the case of <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>, the predominant seller of <a href="PC%20game">PC games</a>, where user reviews are often the only way for <a href="Indie%20game">indie games</a> to gain traction on the service. In some cases, companies that run these storefronts or websites have intervened to stop review bombs and delete the negative reviews.

History.
The website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> was criticized in 2011 for poor oversight of their user reviews, leading to rampant review bombing on popular games such as "<a href="Bastion%20%28video%20game%29">Bastion</a>" and "" that brought their user rating to extremely low levels. The game "<a href="Mass%20Effect%203">Mass Effect 3</a>" was also review bombed on the site in 2012 due to controversy over its ending.

"<a href="Titan%20Souls">Titan Souls</a>" was review bombed in April 2015 by supporters of the <a href="List%20of%20YouTubers">Youtuber</a> <a href="TotalBiscuit">TotalBiscuit</a> after the indie game's developer mocked a statement that the reviewer made saying the game was "absolutely not for me", and Totalbiscuit responded saying he would no longer cover the game, reducing the game's Steam rating to "negative".

"" was review bombed in 2015 by customers angry about the game's introduction of paid <a href="Mod%20%28video%20gaming%29">mods</a>, leading <a href="Valve%20Corporation">Valve</a> to reverse their decision and remove the paid mod functionality.

"" was review bombed on April 28, 2017 by Chinese players demanding a translation of the game to <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>, whom <a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a> called "a powerful new voice".

"<a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20V">Grand Theft Auto V</a>" was review bombed throughout June 2017 by customers angry that the game had banned the popular mod tool <a href="Modding%20in%20Grand%20Theft%20Auto">OpenIV</a>, reducing its overall Steam review rating from "positive" to "mixed". "<a href="Crusader%20Kings%20II">Crusader Kings II</a>" was review bombed in the same month by customers angry that they had raised the prices in some regions.

In 2017, Valve changed their policies to make unpaid games of any kind not count towards the game's review scores. The developer of "<a href="Defender%27s%20Quest">Defender's Quest</a>", Lars Doucet, stated that this policy prevented low priced games from being review bombed, but harmed the visibility of crowdfunded indie games.

Effects.
According to <a href="Steam%20Spy">Steam Spy</a>, review bombing generally has little effect on a game's sales, and may in fact even increase them due to the resultant wave of <a href="publicity">publicity</a>. However, it may be a symptom of decreased consumer goodwill, which can have a more long-lasting effect on the publisher, developers or game series being criticized.

Zanzibar Group

The Zanzibar Group (also known as Zanzibar Films) was a radical French collective of filmmakers active from 1968 to 1970. The group was financed by Sylvina Boissonnas and included filmmakers <a href="Philippe%20Garrel">Philippe Garrel</a> and <a href="Jackie%20Raynal">Jackie Raynal</a>. Sally Shafto has referred to them as "the Dandies of May 1968", in reference to <a href="May%201968%20events%20in%20France">the civil unrest in France</a> at the time.

History.
The Zanzibar group comprised young radical French filmmakers, some of whom had dropped out of university to make films. The group's constituent members were <a href="dandy">dandies</a>, and some were models. The group's work was financed by Sylvina Boissonnas. Productions were sparse: directors shot without scripts and actors were typically not paid for their work. The group shot on expensive <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm film</a>.

In 1969, several members of the group embarked on a trip to Africa to shoot Serge Bard's film "Au-delà". However, Bard abandoned the project before reaching their namesake destination.

The Zanzibar group dissolved when Boissonnas stopped financing their films and instead became more active in the French feminist movement. Boissonnas was unable to sell the rights to the group's films to distributors, and so the group's work remained relatively unknown until a 2000 screening at the <a href="Cin%C3%A9math%C3%A8que%20Fran%C3%A7aise">Cinémathèque Française</a>.

Palazzo San Sebastiano

The Palazzo San Sebastiano is a 16th-century palace in <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>. Built by the <a href="Gonzaga%20family">Gonzaga family</a>, since 19 March 2005 it has housed Mantua's city museum ("Museo della Città di Palazzo San Sebastiano").

History.
The building was constructed between 1506 and 1508 by <a href="Francesco%20II%20Gonzaga">Francesco II Gonzaga</a> and became his favourite residence until his death in 1519. It was designed by <a href="Gerolamo%20Arcari">Gerolamo Arcari</a> and <a href="Bernardino%20Ghisolfo">Bernardino Ghisolfo</a>, who also commissioned artists such as <a href="Lorenzo%20Leonbruno">Lorenzo Leonbruno</a>, Matteo Costa and <a href="Lorenzo%20Costa%20the%20Elder">Lorenzo Costa the Elder</a> to decorate the interior. The Palazzo's main hall was also the original setting for Mantegna's "<a href="Triumphs%20of%20Caesar%20%28Mantegna%29">Triumphs of Caesar</a>", now at <a href="Hampton%20Court">Hampton Court</a> near London.

After 1519 the Palazzo lost its prime position among the Gonzaga palaces, with its most valuable furniture and paintings moved elsewhere, and it was used by the Gonzaga di Novellara, Gazzuolo and Castiglione delle Stiviere branches of the family. It was in this Palazzo that <a href="Aloysius%20Gonzaga">Aloysius Gonzaga</a> (a future saint) ceded his inheritance to his younger brother Rodolfo. The building was then forgotten until the mid 18th century, when it became a storehouse and barracks for the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austrian government</a>. This usage accelerated the damage to and decay of the original structure, with the frescoes almost completely disappearing, especially when the building was used as a hospital in 1883. It was restored in the 20th century and became a public baths, an elephant colony, schools, storerooms and recreational societies.

Another restoration from 1999 to 2003 aimed wherever possible to restore the building to its original scheme and at least partially to recover the interior and exterior wall paintings and decoration. It allowed the fragments of external fresco to be stabilised and recovered, showing them to be typical of Mantuan buildings from 1550 to 1600. In 2003 the "Loggia dei marmi" and cycle of frescoes in the "Camera del Crogiuolo", "Camera delle Frecce" and "Camera del Sole" were all opened to the public. The <a href="2012%20Northern%20Italy%20earthquakes">2012 Northern Italy earthquakes</a> damaged some rooms in the Palazzo.

Museum.
The Museum was founded in the 19th century as the Museo Patrio. It is displayed in seven thematic sections:

The works displayed included:

Risorgimento section.
The "Museo del Risorgimento di Mantova" was inaugurated on 3 March 1903, the fiftieth anniversary of the death of the <a href="Belfiore%20martyrs">Belfiore martyrs</a>. It was based in several different locations until in 2005, with no base of its own, its collections were formally merged into that of the City Museum. The weapons, uniforms, newspapers, manifestoes, paintings and stamps in the <a href="Risorgimento">Risorgimento</a> collection date from the Napoleonic era until the <a href="Third%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">Third Italian War of Independence</a>, after which <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> was annexed to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861-1946%29">Kingdom of Italy</a>. The display deals with Mantua's part in the <a href="Risorgimento">Risorgimento</a> and consists of five sections - the Napoleonic era; the Restoration and the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">Revolutions of 1848</a>; the Belfiore conspiracy; the period between the <a href="Second%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">Second</a> and Third Wars of Independence.

Literary space

Literary space – a model of the world presented in a literary work.

Approaches to literary space.
The past approach.
Space in the 20th century was regarded as a part of various literary spheres, such as the narrative situation. It changed only in the last decade of the period. Since then literary space has been treated as an independent and unique entity, semantic centre of the work, while such notions as the time of action or characters became its particularizations. 

The modern approaches.
Yuri Lotman.
The first person to approach the issue of literary space was <a href="Yuri%20Lotman">Yuri Lotman</a>. According to Lotman, artistic space is only a model of real space, not its copy. He argued that the information provided by the text about space is incomplete and, consequently, space also is not complete. Being discontinued (what is not mentioned in the text does not exist), space cannot be reconstructed by the implied reader (Lotman 1977, <nowiki>"Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola"</nowiki>, p.213).

What is more, Lotman broached in his literary studies the question of the relationship between space in the text and space of the real world. He claimed both space organisations are governed by cultural stereotypes and conventions, which serve as kind of a <nowiki>'mediator' between them. However, while additional senses are imposed on textual space by cultural codes, extratextual space uses the reworked ones. Through textual hints (described customs, clothing, etc.) literary space can refer to more general knowledge of the implied reader of the empirical reality. The aim of this measure is to make possible the association of the fictional world with the experiential one not calling it as if "</nowiki>by name”.

Utilizing extratextual patterns, the author of a literary work creates their own vision of the world and they do it through the use of description. Limited just like description, such an authorial model does not exist beyond the textual frames and is composed of relations resulting from senses imposed on space. Those, in turn, may suggest non-spatial meanings (e.g. "up" is better, "down" is worse as in the case of a social hierarchy of <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a>' "<a href="The%20Time%20Machine">The Time Machine</a>" and the Morlocks and the Eloi):"Literary space represents an author's model of the world, expressed in the language of spatial representation. In a literary work, space models different relations of the world-picture: temporary, social, ethical and others. […] in the literary models of the world―space sometimes metaphorically adopts meanings of relations in the modelled world-structure, that are themselves not spatial at all."

Janusz Sławiński.
 considered the presented reality to be the most fundamental code modelling space, understood as the principles organising the thematic-compositional plane of a single literary work. This reality is the construction of words, the result of all the linguistic as well as stylistic choices which are made by the implied author, and as such, does not exist beyond the text. It is vital not only to imagine space but also to follow the narration, the description, and the course of action, since all those may shape the fictitious reality by imposing the additional meanings on it.

Literary/cultural conventions constitute the second space-modelling code. This system is more abstract one than the previous one. It does not refer to how an individual work shapes space but how it is conventionally done by a given epoch, genre, etc. So, for instance, one of the main features of Gothic novels are elements of the supernatural and the sublime, therefore, texts are full of ghosts, vampires and so on.

Language is the last of codes shaping space. Every language models space in a different manner. The language of geography, for example, differentiates <a href="Cardinal%20direction">cardinal and intercardinal directions</a>, among others, west or north-east, while geometry uses <a href="Relative%20direction">relative directions</a>, for instance, left/right/backward(s)/forward(s). In short, it can be said that language organises space in a way, defines it, and provides terms for various types of spatial arrangements.

Finally, Sławiński put an emphasis on description, scenery and superimposed senses, three interrelated planes influencing space (Sławiński 2000, p. 205)

The descriptive plane is the aspect of narration and consists of words. It is especially crucial to space when it is introduced to the implied reader. The spatial relationship would be impossible to define without description. It describes space directly or implies it, developing together with characters' movements. This 'development' makes the description a dynamic notion in a sense that it creates meanings. Certain elements of the description relate to each other not only on the grammatical but also semantic level. For example, there are relations between words and phrases. Added-on meanings imposed on particular fragments of a text are, for instance, the consequence of such relations.

Contrary to description, scenery is considered to be a static entity as it results from description. Description producing scenery may consist of a single block of text or scenery can be the effect of numerous descriptive references in such a text put together.

Superimposed senses are the last plane. They are a structure caring added-on meanings. They are not conditioned in any way and are type of a subcode which shapes non-spatial relationships and values (Sławiński 2000, p. 212).

Mieczysław Porębski.
According to space can be divided into three types, namely, extratextual, intertextual and intratextual. The first is where works of art are stored. It is physical, 3-dimensional and, therefore, can be "experienced" by readers (e.g. libraries). The second type is space only in a metaphorical sense, a set of conventions, of common fields of references for a certain piece of writing. It may refer either to other texts or literary traditions (just like <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>'s "The Hobbit" by the appearance of dwarves alludes to, for instance, fairy tales), or both, and as such, intertextual space is an abstract notion. The last space differentiated by Porębski is, intratextual space, is what can be called 'an intentional space' since it is implied and, provoked by the text itself, exists only in the implied reader's imagination.

Porębski derived three subspaces from the intratextual space: physical, symbolical and mathematical ones.The physical space is considered to be an intricate structure, not ordered. What is more, it is 3-dimensional to characters and infinite (lines of length, etc. can be prolonged as much as one wishes them to). The symbolical type of space is the way in which culture arranges it. It is the most primary type of spatial organisation, and it is so crucial due to its metaphysical and eschatological dimension but only when some additional meanings are endows otherwise semantically neutral space. The mathematical type of space can be divided further into topological and geometrical spaces. The former shows how space is perceived in both cultural and mythological way, having much in common with a symbolical space, the latter uses map features, e.g. distances, symmetries, proportions, etc.

Vince Stingl (born as Vincze (Vincentius) Ferencz Stingl, 23 May 1796 - around 1850) was a <a href="Hungarian%20people">Hungarian</a>-<a href="German%20people">German</a> porcelain manufacturer, entrepreneur, industrialist who founded the <a href="Herend%20Porcelain%20Manufactory">Herend Porcelain Manufactory</a> in <a href="Herend">Herend</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>.

Life.
Early years.
Vince Stingl was born on 23 May 1796 in <a href="Sopron">Sopron</a> to Leopold Stingl and Catharina Stermenzky. 

Stingl's grandfather "Casparus Stingl" (son of "Christoph Stingl") moved from <a href="H%C3%A4tzenren">Hätzenren</a>, <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, to <a href="Sopron">Sopron</a>, where he got citizen rights on 19 January 1748 and worked as a <a href="coppersmith">coppersmith</a>. He had six daughters: "Anna Maria" (1745-1791), "Theresia" (1747-?), "Maria Elisabeth" (1750-?), "Magdalena" (1752-?), "Susanna" (1755-?), "Catharina" (1760-1819) and one son, "Leopold" (1755-) who inherited his father's job. He lived in the "515 Würtshaus Gasse" (today "56 Várkerület") with his wife, "Catharina Stermenzky" and their eleven children "Mathias" (1786-1806), "Theresia" (1787-?), "Theresia" (1789-?), "Leopoldus" (1791-), "Aloysia"(1794-?), "Maria Catharina" (1797-?), "Maria" (1800-?), "Anna Catharina" (1802-1803), "Nepomuk Johann" (1804-?), "Anna Jozefa" (1806-?) and "Vince". His father was a <a href="coppersmith">coppersmith</a>.

In 1807 Vince's father died. His sons were too young to take over the father's job and they don't want to work as coppersmith, because at that time other types of bowls and dishes especially ceramics were spreading. His mother moved with the children to <a href="P%C3%A1pa">Pápa</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> where they started to study cardpainting. In <a href="P%C3%A1pa">Pápa</a> Vince worked also as card painter.

Stingl learnt first in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and then from 1814 in <a href="P%C3%A1pa">Pápa</a> <a href="tile">tile production</a> before he became the production manager of the "Schlögel Stoneware Factory" ("Schlögel Kőedénygyár") in <a href="Tata%2C%20Hungary">Tata</a>, <a href="Kom%C3%A1rom%20County">Komárom</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> at the age of 23.

Herend Porcelain Manufactory.
Then he moved to <a href="Herend">Herend</a>, <a href="Veszpr%C3%A9m%20County">Veszprém</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> where he bought land and founded his own <a href="earthenware">earthenware</a> and <a href="stoneware">stoneware</a> <a href="pottery">pottery</a> manufacture in 1826 which became later the well-known <a href="Herend%20Porcelain%20Manufactory">Herend Porcelain Manufactory</a>. 

The company's main products were at the beginning only <a href="stoneware">stoneware</a> and <a href="earthware">earthware</a> especially chimney bricks. According to some sources he made several experiments to make lighter porcelain. 

In Europe until the 17th century there were just heavy folk pottery produced and only the wealthiest could afford to have fine, thin tablewares on their tables. These porcelain products were all imported from China by ship. Around 1705 a <a href="German%20people">German</a> <a href="alchemist">alchemist</a>, <a href="Johann%20Bottger">Johann Bottger</a> discovered a method of producing porcelain which resulted in the establishment of several new manufactures across Europe. 
In 1839 because of financial difficulties he sold some of his shares to <a href="M%C3%B3r%20Fischer">Mór Fischer</a>. After a year in 1840 Fischer bought the whole company because Stingl was in lack of capital and could not continue to operate the factory.

Stingl stayed not long there as the head of the company after the sale.

Városlődi Kerámiagyár.
Around 1830 he and his relative Károly Stingl founded the "Városlőd Ceramicsfactory" ("Városlődi Kerámiagyár") in the next village, <a href="V%C3%A1rosl%C5%91d">Városlőd</a>, <a href="Veszpr%C3%A9m%20County">Veszprém</a>, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>. Dishes, flasks, vases and flower pots were produced there with typical Hungarian decorations. Earlier he wanted to move his other factory from Herend to Városlőd, but he did not get a permission from the bishopric for that. Despite the growing business he ran out of money in 1840 so he sold the enterprise to <a href="J%C3%A1nos%20Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Mayer">János György Mayer</a>.

According to some sources he worked as a barkeeper during the last years of his life.

Personal life.
He married to Anna Pauer (Bauer) and lived in <a href="Szentg%C3%A1l">Szentgál</a>, a neighbouring village to <a href="Herend">Herend</a>. They were both members of the <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Hungary">Roman Catholic Church</a>. They had together three sons and four daughters:

Harry Winbush

Harry Stephen Winbush (born 1903) was an Australian architect based in Melbourne.

Early life.
Winbush was born in Melbourne. His father was a builder. The prominent Melbourne architect, <a href="Percy%20Edgar%20Everett">Percy Everett</a> recommended that Winbush study architecture. He did well in his studies gaining his architecture qualifications in Melbourne and later in London.

Career.
Architectural commissions.
During his professional career he designed many residential and commercial buildings. Other buildings he designed included fire stations in Port Melbourne Box Hill and <a href="Seabrook%20and%20Fildes%23Windsor%20Fire%20Station.2C%201939">East Kew</a> built in 1941 and currently recommended for heritage listing.

He designed a theatre for the Essendon Society of Arts, as well as hospitals situated in <a href="Essendon%2C%20Victoria">Essendon</a> and <a href="Greensborough%2C%20Victoria">Greensborough</a>-Diamond Valley. He designed sporting infrastructure including the main grandstand - the A.F. Showers Pavilion at <a href="Windy%20Hill%2C%20Essendon">Windy Hill, Essendon</a> the home of the <a href="Essendon%20Bombers">Essendon Bombers</a> football club. He designed one of the first of the 'new-generation' of indoor sporting facilities - the ten-pin bowling alley.

He also designed the <a href="Moonee%20Ponds">Moonee Ponds</a> <a href="Trugo">Trugo</a> club and an <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> house in Fletcher St Essendon as well as public libraries in <a href="Glenroy%2C%20Victoria">Glenroy</a> and Essendon.

He undertook a wide range of architectural commissions including pioneering examinations of: "Obsolescence in Residential Properties" and "Camouflaging of buildings around Melbourne", and "Camouflaging of the gun emplacements at <a href="Point%20Nepean">Point Nepean</a>" - the entrance to Port Philip Bay, during World War 2.

Academic positions.
Winbush was appointed, in 1943, head of the Department of Art and Architecture which was to become the <a href="RMIT%20School%20of%20Architecture%20and%20Design">Department of Architecture and Design</a> at the <a href="RMIT%20University">Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)</a>. He was responsible for the management of the education of thousands of students.

In 1948, he developed the RMIT Interior Design course which in turn led to the establishment the 'Industrial Design Institute of Australia' which was renamed as the <a href="Design%20Institute%20of%20Australia">Design Institute of Australia</a> He retired from his position as head of RMIT Architecture and Design in 1968.

During this period he also established and maintained a successful architectural consulting business.

Professional positions.
In 1949 the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Institute%20of%20Architects">Royal Australian Institute of Architects</a> (RAIA) established a Joint Board of Architectural Education. It was this Board which became the vehicle through which the profession directly influenced architectural education in Australia through the accreditation of both courses and educational institutions. Winbush was a member of that first Board.

He was appointed President of the RAIA, 1955-57.

Winbush was a graduate of <a href="Melbourne%20University">Melbourne University</a> and a Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (FRAIA) and also a Fellow the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> (FRIBA). He went on to become a member of the Melbourne University, Faculty of Architecture.

He was chairman of the Architects' Registration Board of Victoria. As a councillor of the <a href="National%20Trust%20of%20Victoria">National Trust of Victoria</a> he was actively engaged in the preservation of Victoria's historic buildings.

No place like home.
During the 1960s, new houses were being built across the ever-expanding suburbs of Melbourne. He was asked to prepare feature articles for the <a href="Herald%20Sun">Melbourne Sun</a> newspaper detailing his comprehensive ‘road–tests’ of those homes. The column was titled, "No place like home" and ran every week from March 1964 until June 1973. The University of Melbourne, Department of Architecture reported: 

The Melbourne 'Sun' introduced a new feature to appear weekly on Tuesdays—"No Place Like Home" written by Mr. Harry Winbush, head of the School of Architecture at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Besides the expected general information for the prospective homeowner, on finance, renovations, decorations, etc; the column assesses the stock range of builders' houses for sale. A worthwhile analysis, for it points out not only what the buyer gets for his money, but also what he doesn't get (e.g. sewerage facilities, polished floors, fences etc); and it is also critical of fittings and planning. The level of the column drops to catch-phrases however with remarks such as "The feature wall of stained and varnished pine in the family living area is a happy thought." The service is apparently directed towards readers who find the "Age" R.V.I.A. Small Homes Service too highbrow, or at 10 guineas per plan, too expensive.

Rotary International.
Winbush was an active member of <a href="Rotary%20International">Rotary International</a> for nearly 50 years and was held in high regard by his fellow members. He was President of the <a href="Essendon">Essendon</a> club in 1951-52. In 1952 he designed for Rotary a "Pioneers Retreat" (and as described in the Rotary Club history), "a beautiful cream-brick building in the sylvan setting of Queens Park, <a href="Moonee%20Ponds">Moonee Ponds</a>". Another project which Essendon Rotary supported was 'Gladswood Lodge', (with Winbush known as its 'honorary architect'), which continues to provide care for the aged. He also instigated the forming of the Brunswick Rotary Club in 1953.

Essendon Rotary Club, at that time had established and continued to assist in the maintenance of 'Rowallan Recreation and Adventure Camp' set in 74 hectares (183 acres) of natural bushland in the Catherine Valley, <a href="Gisborne%2C%20Victoria">Gisborne</a> for <a href="Boy%20Scouts">Boy Scouts</a> and <a href="Girl%20Guides">Girl Guides</a>.

Winbush was recognised as a <a href="Paul%20P.%20Harris">Paul Harris</a> Fellow, an honour recognising outstanding service and represented Rotary Australia at international conferences.

Date and time notation in Mongolia

Date.
The date format follows the Mongolian language, which has been big-endian. Consequently, it agrees with year first, month next, and day last. Example: . A leading zero is optional in practice (mostly not added). Cyrilic characters that mean year, month, and day are often used as separators too. Example: . Since the characters clearly label the date, the year may be abbreviated to two digits when this format is used.

In speech, the date is spoken in the same format as it is written. Using the example: (pürev), (Khoyor myanga doloon) (ony) (Naiman) (saryn) (Арван).

Ordinal Mongolian is a colloquial term used to express the day of the month instead of cardinal Mongolian. It is rarely used in formal writing. Using the example: (pürev), (Khoyor myanga doloon) (ony) (Naiman) (saryn) (Arvan dakhi). Ordinal Mongolian is more often used when the month is understood from the context, i.e.: 10 дахь for the 10th.

Weeks are most often identified by the last day of the week, either the Friday in business (e.g., "") or the Sunday in other use (e.g., ""). The first day of the week or the day of an event are sometimes referred to (e.g., "").

Time.
The <a href="12-hour%20clock">12-hour clock</a> is often used in spoken language. The <a href="24-hour%20clock">24-hour notation</a> is used in writing, with a colon as the standardised and recommended separator. Example: .

Ernani Braga

Ernani Braga (born Hernani da Costa Braga; January 10, 1888 – September 17, 1948) was a Brazilian composer, pianist and conductor, concerned to belong to the second generation of the nationalists in music. He composed works for voice, choir, orchestra and piano. He is little known outside the South America. <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20Francisco%20Braga">Antônio Francisco Braga</a> (1868–1945), with whom he is sometimes confused, was his teacher and friend. Among Ernani Braga's pupils was <a href="Camargo%20Guarnieri">Camargo Guarnieri</a>.

Life.
Early years and studies.
Braga was born in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> on January 10, 1888 to a Poetuguese family, a fifth child of the nine. His father, João Joaquim da Costa Braga, was a prosperous merchant, who moved to Brasil in the middle of XIXth century. His mother was Antônia Maria Xavier Braga. Ernani's elder sister Zaíra had interest in music too, and it was she who became his first teacher. The father died in 1897, and the boy entered a boarding school of Colégio Salesiano de Santa Rosa in <a href="Niter%C3%B3i">Niterói</a>, where he remained up to 1904. On the second school year he began conducting masses and chants sung at the college chapel.

In 1904 Braga returned to his mother and siblings to work in the family business. He took piano lessons with Manuel Faulhaber, and in 1910, not without this professor's encouragement, entered the <a href="Escola%20de%20M%C3%BAsica%20da%20Universidade%20Federal%20do%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Instituto Nacional de Música</a> to study piano, theory, harmony and counterpoint. His professors were <a href="Arthur%20Napole%C3%A3o%20dos%20Santos">Arthur Napoleão dos Santos</a>, <a href="Alberto%20Nepomuceno">Alberto Nepomuceno</a>, <a href="Alfredo%20Bevilacqua">Alfredo Bevilacqua</a>, <a href="Agnello%20Fran%C3%A7a">Agnello França</a> and <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20Francisco%20Braga">Antônio Francisco Braga</a>. In 1913 he was sent to Paris. There he made acquaintance with <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">Vincent d'Indy</a>, Piaggio and the pianist <a href="Lucien%20Wurmern">Lucien Wurmern</a>. Braga deepened his compositional skills with d'Indy's handbook "Cours de composition musicale". On one occasion he performed at the "Salle Pleyel". He also met in Paris his future wife, Eponina D'Atri (daughter of Brazilian cultural attache Alessando D'Atri): he gave her piano lessons, and the same year they got married.

In 1914 Braga came back to Rio de Janeiro to continue his studies at the Instituto Nacional de Música. In 1916 a son was born to him and named Francisco, in honor of professor <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20Francisco%20Braga">Antônio Francisco Braga</a>. The same year Ernani graduated with distinction and a gold medal (the president of the jury was the Polish virtuoso <a href="Ignacy%20Jan%20Paderewski">Ignacy Jan Paderewski</a>). In 1919 Braga entered a competition for a free professorship of piano, and in 1921 he took his teacher Bevilacqua's professor chair at the Instituto Nacional de Música. In 1920 another child was born, a daughter Vera, and he invited Antônio Francisco Braga to be godfather to her. After he became a professor, Ernani continued giving recitals and developed relations with different persons of culture. Together with his wife he met the <a href="Heitor%20Villa-Lobos">Villa-Lobos</a> couple.

Modernism and nationalism.
In the years 1921/22–1927 Braga resided in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, where he was professor of piano at the <a href="Conservat%C3%B3rio%20Dram%C3%A1tico%20e%20Musical%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">Conservatório Dramático e Musical</a>. He also taught in <a href="Campinas">Campinas</a>, <a href="Araraquara">Araraquara</a> and <a href="Jaboticabal">Jaboticabal</a>. Among his pupils can be listed <a href="Adolpho%20Tabacow">Adolpho Tabacow</a> and <a href="Camargo%20Guarnieri">Camargo Guarnieri</a>.

He took part in the famous "<a href="Modern%20Art%20Week">Semana de Arte Moderna</a>" in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a> (1922) as interpreter of compositions by <a href="Heitor%20Villa-Lobos">Heitor Villa-Lobos</a> and <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a>'s parody on <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a>'s <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%202%20%28Chopin%29">funeral march</a> (No.2 of "<a href="Embryons%20dess%C3%A9ch%C3%A9s">Embryons desséchés</a>").

After São Paulo Braga moved to <a href="Recife">Recife</a>, where he became one of the founders of the <a href="Conservat%C3%B3rio%20Pernambucano%20de%20M%C3%BAsica">Pernambuco Conservatory</a> (1930). He left the city in 1939 and spent 2 years in concert tours through the country. In the years 1942–1943 he resided in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> moderating the "Hora do Brasil" program. In 1944 he returned to Brazil. In 1946 Braga came back to São Paulo, where he died on September 17, 1948.

Compositions.
Ernani Braga's earliest compositions date from the beginning of 1920s. According to his daughter Vera, they were highly influenced by German <a href="lied">lied</a> tradition and by the works of <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a> particularly. The composer's acquaintance with Villa-Lobos and other modernists along with folklore researches made him a follower of <a href="M%C3%A1rio%20de%20Andrade">Mário de Andrade</a>'s nationalistic ideas. His compositions usually include elements of Brazilian folk music, and his most important works are thought to be harmonizations of folk songs.

The most famous work by Braga is "Cinco canções nordestinas do folclore brasileiro" (Five Songs of Northeastern Brazilian Folklore). This collection is based on material from a region with sizeable population of African people. Their influence produces intricate rhythmic patterns and leads to the use of African dialects. The speech rhythm becomes an important compositional device in these pieces.

Another important work by Braga is a song collection titled "Cancioneiro Gaúcho", composed for the bicentenary of <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a> (1940). It was intended to meet the demands of the political strategy of the <a href="Vargas%20Era">Vargas Era</a>. It consists of eleven songs, of which the last ("Velha gaita") was harmonized only for one voice and piano, while each of the other ten songs have two versions: for 2 female voices and piano (however in most of the songs the second voice is "<a href="ad%20libitum">ad libitum</a>") or for female chorus "<a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>" (usually 3- or 4-part, though the "Chimarrita" is 5-part). The lack of choral arrangement for the last song was explained by Braga merely through the lack of time, but there is an old LP recording of such arrangement, what makes one suggest that the composer worked it out at some moment later.

The Retreat (Michael Jones book)

The Retreat: Hitler's First Defeat is a 2009 book by <a href="Military%20history">military historian</a> Michael K. Jones. It is about the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow">Battle of Moscow</a> concentrating on the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow%23Aftermath">German retreat from Moscow during 1941-1942</a>.


Reception.
A reviewer of "The Retreat" in <a href="Adrian%20Gilbert">Adrian Gilbert's</a> "War Books Review", wrote "On the whole, Jones’ approach works very well, giving the reader a discomfiting vision of the hideous nature of the war on the Eastern Front..." and although critical of Jones overusing available source material, concluded "The Retreat is a fine piece of work, which shows the horror of the Moscow campaign in all its searing detail."

History.
The three Williams brothers – James (tenor), Eddie (lead), and Nick (baritone) – have sung together from a young age, and had sung with their father, Nigel Williams (bass), as a quartet named "Homespun". Homespun competed at the BABS Conventions for many years, placing third in 2013. They were a crowd favourite but over time Nigel decided to step down. In 2014, Phil Cuthbert, a long-time family friend, stepped in to help form their new quartet, "Finest Hour". After placing third in their first national competition in 2015, they went on to win the gold medal in <a href="Harrogate">Harrogate</a> in May 2016 with a record-high score of 82.9 per cent.

After this contest, Cuthbert decided to step down and Jonathan Pipe, a fellow singer with <a href="The%20Grand%20Central%20Chorus">The Grand Central Chorus</a> in Nottingham, transitioned to the quartet's bass voice part. Pipe had previously sung with the House Lights Up quartet in Spain, which placed third at the Spanish Association of Barbershop Singers convention in <a href="Benalm%C3%A1dena">Benalmádena</a> in 2015.

Foxhole (video game)

Foxhole is an upcoming <a href="Cooperative%20game%20theory">cooperative</a> <a href="Sandbox%20video%20game">sandbox</a> <a href="Massively%20multiplayer%20online%20game">massively-multiplayer</a> <a href="Action%20video%20game">action</a>-<a href="Strategy%20video%20game">strategy</a> video game being developed and published by Canadian <a href="video%20game%20company">video game company</a> Clapfoot. The game uses <a href="Unreal%20Engine">Unreal Engine 4</a>, and is positioned from a <a href="top-down%20view">top-down view</a>, much like that of a conventional <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> video game. The game allows the user to join one of two factions as a soldier, having the choice of contributing to a persistent war by organising, acquiring and transporting resources as well as supplies, providing manpower and vehicles in combat, building and managing fortifications and upgrading production facilities with the end goal of annihilating the opposition. The game has been in alpha-stage since 28 July 2017 with a planned full release on <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>.

The game was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>'s <a href="Steam%20Early%20Access">early access</a> program in July 2017, garnering a peak no. of 4,813 concurrent players in under 2 weeks.

Gameplay.
Players can choose between two opposing <a href="Faction">factions</a>, The Colonials and The Wardens, with up-to 60 players on each side. The role of the player is not predetermined: there is no class-based system used, which encourages players to react to the dynamics of a war without being limited by their initial choice. The game features an <a href="Virtual%20economy">in-game economy</a> that is player-driven, necessitating the need for players to use tools, such as a <a href="hammer">hammer</a> or <a href="sledgehammer">sledgehammer</a>, in order to gather raw resources from stylised <a href="Ore">ore deposits</a>, that are indicated with map markers. Gathered resources can be stored by the player until they become overencumbered, forcing them to either unload the materials into a nearby storage box or truck for later transport to a manufacturing plant, where the gathered resources can be refined and used in order to <a href="Manufacturing">manufacture</a> supplies, weapons and ammunition, as well as fortifications and vehicles. 

Upon choosing a faction, the player spawns outside of a town hall of the <a href="Military%20base">starting base</a> of their chosen faction, which are the first structures available in-game that are capable of storing <a href="Stockpile">stockpiles</a> of equipment that any player is capable of acquiring from the stockpile. Stockpiles can be stored at any town hall, barracks or outpost in-game, all of which can be replenished with crates of specific supplies that are made and delivered by players. There is a heavy reliance on coordinated <a href="logistics">logistics</a> in the game, requiring organised supply drops to <a href="Forward%20operating%20base">frontline outposts</a> in order to keep players who are fighting on the frontline supplied with weapons and ammunition, as well as providing materials for engineers who can repair fortifications and vehicles. 

Players are encouraged to work together to efficiently use <a href="Resource">resources</a>, <a href="Military%20intelligence">intel</a>, <a href="Military%20vehicle">vehicles</a>, <a href="Weapon">weapons</a> and <a href="ammunition">ammunition</a> to gain the upper hand over the opposition. Players can also plan and execute attacks as part of squads, coordinating attacks using a map-marking system, with environmental features coming into play with terrain variation, as well as the possibility of carrying out reconnaissance to gain a tactical advantage over the opposition. Although secondary to the objective of winning the war as a faction, a players efforts towards the war can be noticed by peers, which allows players to rise through the ranks within a faction through fellow players commending them for their support. A day and night cycle exists in the game, with one in-game day being equal to 1 hour in <a href="Real-time%20computing">real-time</a>.

In Campaign mode, all opposing outposts must be captured or destroyed in a region in order to gain access to the next region. Alternatively, servers that are independent of the Campaign mode restart conflict in the same region from Day 1.

When offline, players' soldiers will remain in-game but will be shown as inactive with a sleeping animation until the player returns to that server.

Development.
The concept for Foxhole was conceived in early 2016 when developer Clapfoot was at the time developing their first title "Fortified". Foxhole's goal was to make a massively multiplayer war game that took place in a persistent world, leaving it up to players to drive all aspects of the war effort. 

Early conceptualisations of the game explored possible features such as a first person perspective camera and a turn-based gameplay format. Ultimately, a top-down perspective was adopted to encourage a focus toward strategy and player collaboration rather than immersion. The decision was made early on in the development process for the game to take place in a fictional universe that paid creative homage to early 20th century warfare. Clapfoot's direction was centered on developing vehicle, weapon, and character designs that were original rather than historical. 

Clapfoot began working on prototypes for Foxhole in early 2016, which lead to public release in pre-alpha stage in July 2016. The first iterations supported 64 players per server instance in one region, eventually leading to 120 player support. A planned mode called World Conquest has been tested, involving all 6 in-game regions that could support up to 480 players per shard, but is yet to be implemented into a public release of the game.

Reception.
Despite being an early access title, Foxhole has been generally well received by players, as well as reviewers who have opted to give preliminary reviews. The game has a 85% approval rating on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>, based on 1,792 user reviews, as of 10 August 2017.

<a href="Green%20Man%20Gaming">Green Man Gaming</a>'s Rob gave the game a positive preliminary verdict, commenting on its "unique gameplay...adding a new-depth to online play" with a suggestion that the early-access game could be a "[potential] contender to knock [PlayerUnknown's] <a href="PlayerUnknown%27s%20Battlegrounds">Battlegrounds</a> off the current top spot".

"<a href="Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Shotgun">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>"'s Brendan Caldwell discusses the gameplay of Foxhole, commenting on the logistics system, as well as general skill-based gameplay elements, along with the nature of the top-down view in the game, on their Electronic Wireless Show podcast.

An in-depth preliminary review from <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Lief Johnson comments on the cooperative human element of the game, saying "I enjoyed Foxhole, and I know much of that enjoyment grew out the marvel of watching so many players working together."

<doc id="54841832" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54841832" title="Creative Leadership">
Creative Leadership

Creative leadership is a philosophy and style of <a href="leadership">leadership</a> that involves leading a group to a novel and innovative outcome. Creative leaders display behaviors that may contradict traditional <a href="management">management</a> styles. Creative leadership rejects the premise of <a href="creativity">creativity</a> as the act of a lone <a href="genius">genius</a>, and is instead based on the premise that <a href="innovation">innovation</a> emerges from a group of individuals, particularly in conditions that promote creativity. In addition to relying on creative contributions from individuals, creative leaders provide supportive contributions: psychological, material, and/or social supports that trigger, enable, and sustain creative thinking in others.

The term creative leadership is commonly used in <a href="organizational%20studies">organizational studies</a> and was first referenced in 1957. There has been a significant increase in research surrounding creative and innovation leadership in recent years and the term has also been used increasingly among practitioners and in the public sphere. Researchers and practitioners have a shared belief that creative leadership is more important in today's political and economic climate than ever before.

In 2010, the <a href="IBM">IBM</a> Global CEO Study found that creativity was the most important quality for leaders to build successful businesses, outranking <a href="integrity">integrity</a> and global thinking. Although many organisations claim that they value creative leadership, research has found that in reality, most organisations tend to promote leaders who do not espouse creative leadership, and instead are risk-averse and maintain the status quo.

Competencies.
According to Stoll and Temperley (2009, 69–74), creative leaders foster conditions that can help to inspire creativity in others. These conditions include: "stimulating a senseof urgency if necessary, exposing colleagues to new thinking and experiences, providing time and space to facilitate the practicalities; setting high expectations, promoting individual and collaborative creative thinking and design, using failure as a learning opportunity, relinquishing control, and the modelling of creativity and risk-taking."

The five core competencies for creative leadership are: acting with passion and purpose, applying an explorative mindset, envisioning a better future, orchestrating creative teams, and driving breakthrough change. Additionally, good creative leaders consistently develop the following characteristics in themselves: leadership styles and perceptions, understanding of different cultures, individual and team motivations, interpersonal skills, levels of creativity, ability to manage change, communication styles, listening ability, decision-making skills, and, personal ethics. 

Definitions.
Since creative leadership was first used as a concept in the 1950s, numerous researchers have used the term, often with meanings that differ across research contexts. Researchers have agreed that it is inappropriate to apply a singular definition to the concept, given the importance of context when using the term creative leadership.
<br>Views on the definition and scope of creative leadership include:

Conceptualisations.
There are three different complementary conceptualisations which reflect the different contexts in which creative leadership can be applied: facilitating creativity, directing a creative vision, and integrating diverse creative contributions. Creative leadership may be enacted differently depending on the context.

Facilitating.
In the context of facilitating, a leader supports employees or individuals as primary creators, influencing their creative contributions and shaping each stage of the creative process. In the context of facilitating, creative leaders lead in a way that increases employees' likelihood of generating new ideas. As facilitators, creative leaders foster others' creativity and may take individuals through a process that helps them generate new ideas, such as <a href="brainstorming">brainstorming</a>. From providing direction during idea generation to evaluating and promoting new ideas, creative leaders are involved in the entire creative process and shape a supportive climate for creativity.

Directing.
In the context of directing, the creative leader is the primary creator and their vision is enacted through contribution and collaboration from others. The leader is integral to the production of a creative concept, while others support its implementation. The degree to which others contribute creatively may depend upon the situation. This can be compared to an orchestra conductor, who provides a vision and direction for musicians who bring their own individual contributions. A strong directive creative leader inspires, elicits, and integrates high-quality contributions from his or her collaborators.

Integrating.
In the context of integrating, there is a focus on the creative leader's ability to integrate or synthesize his or her novel ideas with various creative ideas from other individuals. Compared to directing and facilitating contexts, there is a greater balance between the ratio of leader to follower creative contributions and supportive contributions in the integrating context. Each individual can receive credit for their distinct contribution, and successful leadership in this context depends on the leader's ability to synthesise others' creative inputs. Film directors are an example of leaders working in an integrating context, providing guidance to create a feature film that includes creative contributions from numerous people: screenwriters, actors, special effects technicians, costume designers, etc.
Research on different types of leadership.

M. Belle Brown

Mary Belle Brown, M.D. (March 1, 1846 - July 13, 1924) was a physician and surgeon, one of the few women in medicine of her time who practiced surgery.

Early life and family.
M. Belle Brown was born in <a href="Staunton%20Township%2C%20Miami%20County%2C%20Ohio">Staunton Township, Miami County, Ohio</a>, on March 1, 1848. Her father, Daniel Brown (1809-1877), was born in Rhode Island and went west in 1828. The genealogy of that branch of the Brown family of which she was a member was notable. He was the son of Arnold Brown and his grandfather was Reverend <a href="Chad%20Brown%20%28minister%29">Chad Brown</a>, a co-founder of <a href="Providence%20Plantations">Providence Plantations</a>. Chad Brown emigrated from England in the ship "Martin," which arrived in Boston, MA, in July 1638. He went to <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>, in the year of his arrival. He was one of a committee of four to prepare the first written form of government adopted and continued in force until 1644, when Roger Williams returned from England with the charter and Chad Brown was the first one of the thirty-nine who signed that charter. In 1642 he was ordained the first settled pastor of the Baptist Church. His great grandsons. John and James, repurchased a part of the land that had originally belonged to him and presented it to the college of Rhode Island. In 1770 the corner-stone of University Hall was laid by <a href="John%20Brown%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">John Brown</a>. In 1804 the name of that institution was changed to <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a>. M. Belle Brown's mother's name was Telford, and her ancestors were of the Jennings family from England. She was the daughter of Andrew Telford, a pioneer of Miami county. From her mother, Eliza Telford (1816-1899), who was the neighborhood doctor in an emergency and kept salves and liniments for everybody who desired them, she inherited her taste for medicine. Brown had 5 siblings: Cyrus Telford (1844-1914), Cornelia J. (1844-1907), Rebecca, Arnold O. (1852-1928) and Harry W. (1860-1917).

Brown was educated in the public schools in Troy, Ohio, and then at the <a href="Oxford%20Female%20College">Oxford Female College</a>, <a href="Oxford%2C%20Ohio">Oxford, Ohio</a>.

Career.
Brown started the study of medicine in 1874. In 1876 she went to New York and entered the <a href="New%20York%20Medical%20College">New York Medical College</a> and Hospital for Women. She was graduated in 1879 and entered immediately upon a general practice in West 34th street, New York. Not much later she moved to 30 West 51st street, where she practiced from 1890 until her retirement. During the earlier years her practice took her frequently to the poorer quarters of the metropolis.

She was one of the few women in medicine of her time who practiced surgery. She attended clinics in New York and Chicago, studying under noted surgeons. She made a specialty of diseases of women and was professor of diseases of women in the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, and was also secretary of the faculty of that institution. She was later made the dean, succeeding in that post Dr. <a href="Clemence%20Sophia%20Harned%20Lozier">Clemence Sophia Harned Lozier</a>.

She was also the discoverer of a remedy for mal-de-mere, or sea-sickness, and train-nausea, called "Ship-shape".

She was a member of the <a href="Royal%20S.%20Copeland">American Institute of Homeopathy</a>, of the <a href="New%20York%20County%20Medical%20Society">New York County Medical Society</a>, a member of the consulting staff of the Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn, and of the New York Homeopathic Sanitarium Association.

Personal life.
After 40 years of career all spent in New York, in 1917 M. Elle Brown retired to <a href="Troy%2C%20Ohio">Troy, Ohio</a>.

During the <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> Brown was intensely active in raising funds for the <a href="American%20Hospital%20of%20Paris">American Hospital of Paris</a>, as well as for the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>.

Brown died on July 13, 1924, in Troy and is buried at Riverside Cemetery, Troy, Section 3, Lot 118, with her family.

<doc id="54842033" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54842033" title="Maqam (shrine)">
Maqam (shrine)

A Maqām ()‎ is a tomb of <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> saints. It is a funeral construction, usually small, cubic-shaped and topped with a dome.
Etymology.
From Arabic literally "a place" or "station." Such name for a holy tomb is mostly used in <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>. There is a form "Mukam" in the essays of European travellers of the 19th century; as well as words "Waly", "Wely" ( — tomb of a saint), "<a href="Mazar%20%28mausoleum%29">Mazar (mausoleum)</a>", "Mashhad".
Due to their cubic shape, these constructions were also called "Kubbeh", "Kubbi", "<a href="Qubba">Qubba</a>" the same way as the major sacred site <a href="Kaaba">Kaaba</a> in <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>. In Turkic-speaking Muslim countries similar tombs are known as <a href="T%C3%BCrbe">Türbe</a>, Dürbe, Aziz and in Iranian-speaking countries — <a href="Dargah">Dargah</a>.

Construction and purpose.
The most popular type of maqams is a single chamber square building topped with a dome, in the middle of which there is a stone <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>, though the bodies of holy men themselves were buried below the ground level. In the south wall of the maqam, facing Mecca, there is usually a small <a href="mihrab">mihrab</a> decorated with inscriptions and floral ornament. The entrance to the chamber is mostly at the north wall. In the other arched walls there are usually small windows.

The maqams are not always supposed to stand over the tombs of the saints to whom they are dedicated. A cenotaph is indeed almost always to be found there, but often they are regarded merely as "stations."
There are also bigger maqams, consisting of two, three or four chambers: prayer chamber, entrance hall, zawiya or a room for pilgrims to have a rest. Big maqams have two or three similar domes. In times of old, the dome was decorated by a metal spire with a crescent, but nowadays such decoration is rare.
A sacred tree was planted near maqams, mostly — a palm tree, oak or <a href="Ficus%20sycomorus">sycomore</a>. There was also a well or spring.
Candelabras and lamps are hanging in an active maqam, a cenotaph is covered by a quilt (usually a green one), praying rugs are spread on the floor in front of the mihrab.
As a rule, maqams were built on the top of the hills or at the crossroads, and besides their main function — shrine and prayer place, they also served as a guard point and a guiding landmark for travelers and caravans. Over the years, new burial places appeared near maqams; it was considered as honour to be buried next to a saint. Big cemeteries formed around many Muslim sanctuaries.

History.
Early Islam disapproved worshipping of holy men and their burial places, considering it a sort of <a href="idolatry">idolatry</a>. But it was <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shiites</a> who started to build sumptuous tombs for their deceased leaders — <a href="imam">imam</a>s and <a href="sheikhs">sheikhs</a>, and turned those tombs into religious objects. Very soon <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunnis</a> followed their example. Arab travellers and geographers <a href="Ali%20ibn%20abi%20bakr%20al-Harawi">‘Ali al-Harawi</a>, <a href="Yaqut%20al-Hamawi">Yaqut al-Hamawi</a> and others described in their essays many Christian and Muslim shrines in Syria, Palestine and Egypt.

During the times of <a href="Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29">Mamluk dynasty</a>, monumental tombs were built for Muslim holy men, scientists and theologists, some of these tombs have come down to present times. The major part of them is located in Egypt, and some parts are also in Syria and Palestine. These are namely the famous <a href="Rachel%27s%20Tomb">Rachel's Tomb</a> in <a href="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> (though the burial place of matriarch <a href="Rachel">Rachel</a> was worshipped even before), the splendid mausoleum of <a href="Abu%20Hurairah">Abu Hurairah</a> in <a href="Yavne">Yavne</a> and the maqam of sheikh Abu ‘Atabi in <a href="Al-Manshiyya%2C%20Acre">Al-Manshiyya, Acre</a>. 
In the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> times, maqams were constructed everywhere, and old sanctuaries were taken under restoration. New buildings were not as monumental and pompous as before, and looked quite unpretentious. In Turkish period, maqams had simple construction and almost no architectural décor. 

The period of <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Mandatory Palestine</a> has become the last time of maqams prosperity. Dilapidated Muslims shrines were restored and also new ones built. The British built over and donated to <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a>s the Maqam of sheikh Nuran, which was damaged during the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a>. This maqam was in the battle epicenter during the <a href="1948%20Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20War">1948 Arab–Israeli War</a>. After having captured it, Israeli soldiers turned it into a watch and firing point. Since that time the maqam of sheikh Nuran is a memorial of the courageous <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israel Defense Forces</a>.
After the State of <a href="Israel">Israel</a> was formed, numerous Muslim shrines were privatized by Jewish and turned them into their own religious shrines. It concerned the mausoleum of sheikh Abu Hurairah, it which has become the tomb of Rabban <a href="Gamaliel%20II">Gamaliel II</a> in <a href="Yavne">Yavne</a>; the Maqam with seven domes of Imam ‘Ali in <a href="Yazur">Yazur</a> has turned into a <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> in <a href="Azor">Azor</a>; the <a href="mazar">mazar</a> of Sitt Sakina (Sukeyna) has become Rachel's tomb, the spouse of <a href="Rabbi%20Akiva">Rabbi Akiva</a> in <a href="Tiberias">Tiberias</a>; the Maqam of sheikh al-Gharbawi — the tomb of <a href="Mattathias">Mattathias</a>; the tomb of Nabi Sheman near the , which has been turned into the tomb of <a href="Simeon%20%28son%20of%20Jacob%29">Simeon (son of Jacob)</a>. The privatization of muslim shrines is still in process.
In ancient times, all maqams with the domes were coloured in white. Recently Palestinian and Israeli Arabs got used to colour the domes of their shrines in green (the colour of Islam). On the territory of Israel battle for one or another shrine resulted in the war of colours, as it was called in press. While privatizing Muslim shrines, religious Jewish paint the dome in blue or white and install Jewish symbols, and Muslims, when coming back, remove Jewish symbols and paint the dome in green. 
Some famous Palestinian maqams.
No more than 300 maqams out of 800 existing in Palestine in 1948, came down to present times, half of them are on the territory of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, the remainder in the <a href="Palestinian%20Authority">Palestinian Authority</a>. According to another source, the number of Palestinian maqams left is 184, with only 70 on the Israeli territories.

Werdau–Mehltheuer railway

The Werdau–Mehltheuer railway is a branch line in the German states of <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a> and <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, originally built and operated by the <a href="Royal%20Saxon%20State%20Railways">Royal Saxon State Railways</a> ("Königlich Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen"). The section from <a href="Werdau">Werdau</a> to <a href="Weida">Weida</a> via <a href="W%C3%BCnschendorf/Elster">Wünschendorf</a> is now closed. The section between Weida and <a href="Mehltheuer">Mehltheuer</a> is part of the <a href="Gera">Gera</a>–<a href="Hof%2C%20Bavaria">Hof</a> link.

History.
The Werdau–Wünschendorf–Weida section was opened by the Saxon State Railways on 29 August 1876.

The building of the section of line to Mehltheuer, which is now part of the community of <a href="Rosenbach%2C%20Vogtland">Rosenbach/Vogtl.</a>, had a complex history: the first plans were developed in 1864, including a planned extension of the Weißenfels–Zeitz–Gera railway, which had been opened by the <a href="Thuringian%20Railway%20Company">Thuringian Railway Company</a> ("Thüringische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft") in 1859, failed due to the resistance of Bavaria. The Mehltheuer-Weida Railway Company ("Mehltheuer-Weidaer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft", MWE) was established in <a href="Plauen">Plauen</a> in 1872 with the aim of constructing a railway line which would be shorter than the existing state railway link from Leipzig via Plauen to Hof and <a href="Cheb">Cheb</a> (then called Eger). The line would branch from the Gera–Saalfeld railway of the Thuringian Railway in <a href="Weida">Weida</a> station, which was located in the Grand Duchy of <a href="Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach">Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach</a>, and run to the south through the territory of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Reuss-Gera">Principality of the Reuss Junior Line</a> via <a href="Hohenleuben">Hohenleuben</a> and <a href="Triebes">Triebes</a> to <a href="Zeulenroda%20unt%20Bf%20station">Zeulenroda lower station</a> ("Zeulenroda unt Bf"), which was located in the <a href="Principality%20of%20Reuss-Greiz">Principality of the Reuss Elder Line</a>. It would eventually reach the Saxon <a href="Vogtland">Vogtland</a> in <a href="Pausa-M%C3%BChltroff">Pausa</a> and after 35 kilometres it would end in Mehltheuer, where it would connect with the state railway between Leipzig and Hof. Treaties were concluded between the four participating governments and the corresponding concessions were granted.

Financial problems developed when construction started. The handing over of the project to the "Eisenbahnkönig" ("railway king") <a href="Bethel%20Henry%20Strousberg">Strousberg</a> also did not assist development. The MWE became bankrupt in 1876 and was acquired by the Saxon State Railways. It downgraded the line to a secondary railway and opened the line from Weida Altstadt to Mehltheuer on 15 November 1883. The Weida–Weida Altstadt section followed on 1884.

The line was later converted to two tracks and upgraded to a main line in places, between Triebes and Zeulenroda in 1913 and over parts of the whole Werdau–Weida–Mehltheuer line in the 1930s, for example between Loitsch-Hohenleuben and Triebes. In the process, the two signal boxes in Loitsch-Hohenleuben and the northern signal box in Triebes were rebuilt in the 1930s.

Since 1945.
There was only limited damage to the line as a result of the war, but the bridge over the <a href="White%20Elster">White Elster</a> near Wünschendorf was blown up. As part of <a href="War%20reparations">reparations</a> to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, the second track was removed after 1945 and the line is still single-track and unelectrified. In the first post-war years, the timetable was very thin: the timetable of 1947 had only three train pairs between Wünschendorf and Zeulenroda on workdays, but on the other two sections there were four. There were two pairs of through trains (one on Sundays and holidays) with a journey time of about 3 hours 30 minutes.

From 1953 until its closure before 1962, a rail link ran from Katzendorf to Teichwolframsdorf and from there to the "sächsischen Aufbereitungsbetrieben" (Saxon processing operations), which was used by uranium ore trains running as <a href="Unit%20train">block trains</a> or in groups of wagons. The loading of uranium ore mined in the open-cast mine of Culmitzsch began in 1957 and the transport of ore to <a href="Lengenfeld">Lengenfeld</a>, <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>-Gittersee, <a href="Tannenbergsthal">Tannenbergsthal</a> and Crossen bei Zwickau for further processing began. A 2.2 km-long connection from Gauern to the Culmitzsch loading yard was opened on 11 September 1958; it was closed in 1966. When the "Neue Fabrik" ("new factory") processing plant (AB 102) in Seelingstädt was opened in 1960, the Culmitz ore traffic was transferred from Seelingstädt station to the processing plant via the "Taigakurve" (Taiga curve).

Since the second track of the adjacent main line, the <a href="Leipzig%E2%80%93Hof%20railway">Leipzig–Hof railway</a>, had also been dismantled for reparations, diverted traffic ran over the Mehltheuer–Weida line, some continuing to Werdau, until the 1970s. This included, for example, the D 145 service between <a href="Munich">Munich</a> and <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> in 1967. In the 1970s, the D 308/309 service from Berlin to Munich was still scheduled to run over the Weida–Mehltheuer section and in the 1980s during construction work on the main lines to <a href="Probstzella">Probstzella</a> and <a href="Burgstein">Gutenfürst</a>, a "Transitzug" (transit train, running non-stop between <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> and <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a>), which was not shown in the timetable, still ran over the line. The 1988/89 timetable listed only a <a href="through%20coach">through coach</a>, running each way between Zwickau and <a href="Bad%20Salzungen">Bad Salzungen</a> via Wünschendorf and Gera on Saturdays. Freight operations on the line—in addition to a local freight shuttle running several times a day on the Gera–Mehltheuer–Gera route—consisted of traffic running to <a href="Seddin%20station">Seddin</a>, partly under the brand of "Trans-Europ-Express-Marchandises" (a system of cross-border freight trains modelled on <a href="Trans%20Europ%20Express">Trans Europ Express</a>), and empty tank wagons.

From 1995 to 1999, a pair of <a href="InterRegio">InterRegio</a> trains ran betweene <a href="Gera">Gera</a> and <a href="Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a> using the Weida–Mehltheuer section, giving the line a long-distance service for a short time again. The train stopped in Weida and Zeulenroda, but not in Mehltheuer. InterRegio trains were occasionally detoured over the Wünschendorf–Werdau section when the Gera–Gößnitz–Glauchau main line, or parts of it, were blocked because of construction work.

The <a href="Federal%20Railway%20Authority">Federal Railway Authority</a> ("Eisenbahn-Bundesamt"; EBA) approved the closure of the <a href="W%C3%BCnschendorf/Elster">Wünschendorf</a>–<a href="Weida%2C%20Thuringia">Weida</a> section on 1 May 1997; freight traffic had already ended on 31 January 1996 and passenger services ended on 2 June of the same year. Thus, the line was no longer used. Deutsche Bahn submitted a request to the Federal Railway Authority to be permitted to dismantle the tracks on this section (km 28.5 to 31.9) on 18 July 2012.

A Regional-Express service running on the Gera–Zwickau route was introduced in 1998 on the Wünschendorf–Werdau section at four-hour intervals, stopping only at <a href="Seelingst%C3%A4dt">Seelingstädt</a>, <a href="Teichwolframsdorf">Teichwolframsdorf</a> and <a href="Werdau">Werdau</a> West. Class 219 locomotives were used, which were clearly underused in hauling only two UIC-Z cars.

Even before the introduction of this Regional-Express service, the timetable on the Zwickau–Werdau–Wünschendorf–Gera route had been thinned, so that the still operating trains were lightly used because of their poor times and lack of stops. No services ran on Sundays in the 1998/99 timetable, favouring the use of cars. This approach improved the case for closing passenger services, which ultimately occurred. An already prepared and begun project for the repair of sections of the line between the stations of Werdau-West, Langenbernsdorf and Teichwolframsdorf was cancelled and not completed, requiring speed restrictions (in places as low as 10 km/h) and leading to further reductions in railway traffic. Deutsche Bahn economised on safety and personnel in the 1998/99 timetable year.

Lack of demand and poor track quality led to the abandonment of Deutsche Bahn's "slowest" Regional-Expresses on 30 May 1999, including all services on this section of line. The closure of the section was approved by the EBA on 15 November 2000. Since then there have been several initiatives for its re-commissioning, but they have been unsuccessful. Since no overpass was installed over the disused line during the construction of the Werdau bypass, the line is now also interrupted between Werdau West and Werdau. In addition, the flying junction that had been built over the Leipzig–Hof railway in Werdau was demolished. The section between Seelingstädt and Gauern, which had been converted into a branch line from Seelingstädt station, was also officially closed. A customer was still served in Gauern by "Wismut-Eisenbahn" until 2003. In June 2007, <a href="Deutsche%20Regionaleisenbahn">Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn</a> (DRE) leased the line from <a href="Deutsche%20Bahn">Deutsche Bahn AG</a> and handed operations of it over to the "Friedrich List" association in <a href="Zwickau">Zwickau</a>, which promotes railways, so that the latter could arrange for train operations between Werdau West and Wünschendorf/Elster to be resumed.

Developments after the closure of the Werdau–Wünschendorf/Elster line.
After the closure of the Wünschendorf/Elster–Werdau/West section, the "Werdauer Waldeisenbahn" (Waldau Forest Railway) project was developed. This section of line has been gradually rehabilitated by a railway association since 2007. At the beginning of September 2007, the company resumed operations with a historic <a href="handcar">handcar</a> operation between Teichwolframsdorf and Langenbernsdorf. In May 2010, five handcar operations were scheduled on the Werdau/West–Langenbernsdorf–Teichwolframsdorf route and in reverse on four weekends. This alternative, offered as an interim solution, has promoted the development of the "Werdauer Waldeisenbahn" and associated tourism in the region. Since 2012, a steam train service has also been occasionally integrated into the rail operations.

After the Weida–Mehltheuer line was operated by <a href="Die%20L%C3%A4nderbahn">Vogtlandbahn</a> from 2000 to 2003, passenger services were operated from June 2012 by <a href="DB%20Regio">DB Regio</a> trains. In 2006, <a href="Regionalbahn">Regionalbahn</a> 103 services ran on the Gera–Mehltheuer route at two hour intervals, stopping at all stations, but in some cases only <a href="Request%20stop">on request</a>. In addition, <a href="Regional-Express">Regional-Express</a> (RE) 12 services ran on the <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>–<a href="Gera">Gera</a>–<a href="Hof%20%28Saale%29">Hof</a> (–<a href="Munich">Munich</a>) route every four hours until December 2006. Because the service ran from <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a> through <a href="Saxony-Anhalt">Saxony-Anhalt</a> and <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a> to <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, this line was also called the "Vier-Länder-Express" ("four states express"). In between the RE services, <a href="Regionalbahn">Regionalbahn</a> (RB) 103 services run between Gera and Zeulenroda, some of which connect directly with Regionalbahn 51 services running between Leipzig and Weida. Trains have not stopped at Pöllwitz and Bernsgrün since the timetable change on 11 December 2011. At this time, the timetable for Monday to Friday on the section from Weida to Zeulenroda included ten more pairs of Regionalbahn services and four pairs of Regional-Express services on the whole route, two of them continuing through Hof to Regensburg.

On 10 June 2012, <a href="Erfurter%20Bahn">Erfurter Bahn</a> (EB) took over all the services in local rail transport and now operates all services as the EBx 13 service ("Erfurter Bahn Express"). While passenger services passed through Pöllwitz without stopping, the stop in Schüptitz was reintroduced after public protests. The timetable now contains a maximum of ten trains a day, of which some continue through Zeulenroda to Hof and some run to or from Leipzig.

On 3 August 2012, DB Netz's south-eastern regional branch sought approval from the Federal Railway Authority for the dismantling of the Werdau West–Mehltheuer line (6653) from rail-km 28.500 to 31.900 in the <a href="Gemarkung">Gemarkung</a> of Wünschdorf/Elster and the Gemarkung of Veitsberg, <a href="Greiz%20%28district%29">district of Greiz</a>. The planned dismantling would be between the stations of Wünschendorf/Elster and Weida.

In the course of an ongoing modernisation of the route and the installation of electronic interlockings, crossing loops were only retained in the stations of Loitsch-Hohenleuben and Zeulenroda unt Bf. Pöllwitz station was closed.

Route description.
Course.
About two-thirds of the Werdau–Weida section is located in Thuringia. From 1900, it left Werdau station to the north-west and then ran through the Werdau Forest ("Werdauer Wald"). Until 1900 the line exited to the south-west and took a shorter route. Before the halt at Trünzig, the line leaves the Werdau Forest, crosses over <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%20175">federal road 175</a> (B 175) in Chursdorf and leaves <a href="Gauern">Gauern</a> running in the valley of the Fuchsbach. South of <a href="W%C3%BCnschendorf/Elster">Wünschendorf/Elster</a>, it swings into the valley of the <a href="White%20Elster">Elster</a>, where it meets the <a href="Gera%20S%C3%BCd%E2%80%93Weischlitz%20railway">Elster Valley Railway</a>. After Wünschendorf, it crosses the Elster after crossing the Elster Valley Railway and ends at Weida station.

The Weida–Mehltheuer section is largely located in the Thuringian region and only the stations of Pausa and Mehltheuer are in Saxony. After crossing the B 175, the line branches from the <a href="Leipzig%E2%80%93Probstzella%20railway">Gera–Saalfeld line</a> and runs along the edge of Weida's old town. It then follow the <a href="Weida%20%28river%29">Weida</a> river to Schüptitz and continues to the south along the Triebes. From Zeulenroda, it climbs to the heights of the <a href="Vogtland">Vogtland</a> and, shortly before Mehltheuer station, it reaches the highest point of the line at 512 metres above sea level. The line crosses <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%2094">federal highway 94</a> in Zeulenroda and <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%20282">federal highway 282</a> in Mehltheuer.

Because of the change in the approach to Werdau station in 1900, which increased the distance, the marked distance in kilometres (chainage) at the start of the line at Werdau changed from 0.00 to −0.182.

Stations.
Werdau ()
The station, which opened with the <a href="Leipzig%E2%80%93Hof%20railway">Leipzig–Hof railway</a> in 1845, was originally far from the centre of the town, but Werdau slowly grew towards the station over the following decades. The station was only extended piecemeal in the following decades, but the station was no longer adequate for the growth of traffic after the opening of the Werdau–Weida–Mehltheuer railway. Thus it was completely rebuilt in 1900 at a cost of about 1.5 million <a href="German%20gold%20mark">marks</a>. Nevertheless, the facilities were again too small in the 1920s, since any expansion on the site was almost impossible, and, as a result, a new marshalling yard was built in Zwickau. At the end of the 1990s, the station was almost completely rebuilt and the facilities of the former locomotive depot were also completely demolished.

After the abandonment of traffic on the Werdau–Wünschendorf (Elster) section on 30 May 1999, the Werdau bypass was built parallel with the Leipzig–Hof railway, cutting the line between "Werdau" and "Werdau West". In addition, the flying junction with the Saxon-Bavarian Railway in Werdau was removed.

Werdau West ()

Although the Werdau–Wünschendorf–Weida section was opened on 29 August 1876, the halt ("Haltepunkt") of "Werdau West" was opened on 1 February 1916 with the laying of the route through the urban area of Werdau. The station was closed with the abandonment of rail traffic between Werdau and Wünschendorf (Elster) on 30 May 1999. The dilapidated wooden entrance building and the platforms are still in place, but while the station sign still existed in 2006, it has now disappeared. The halt is located in the western part of its track system. The street that leads to the halt, called "Straße zum Westbahnhof" (street to the West station), marks the former station. "Werdau West" is the starting point of the "Werdauer Waldbahn", which is operated as a museum railway to Seelingstädt.

Langenbernsdorf ()

"Langenbernsdorf" station was opened on 29 August 1876 as the halt of "Bauernsteig" on the street of the same name south of Langenbernsdorf in the Werdau Forest. It was designated as a "Bahnhof" (station) in 1905 and was renamed "Langenbernsdorf" on 1 May 1908. It was redesignated as a halt in 1933, redesignated as a station in 1952 and redesignated as a halt in 1983. In the station area, the railway forms the southern boundary of the village of Langenbernsdorf, which is connected to the station by "Bahnhofstraße". The station was closed on 24 May 1998, one year before the end of rail traffic between Werdau and Wünschendorf (Elster). The entrance building still exists.

Teichwolframsdorf ()

"Teichwolframsdorf" station was opened on 29 August 1876 as a halt and redesignated as a station in 1905. In addition to the entrance building, the station was equipped with workshops which are still partly preserved. From 1953 until its closure before 1962, a railway connection from Katzendorf to Teichwolframsdorf and "sächsischen Aufbereitungsbetrieben" (Saxon processing operations) was used by uranium ore trains running as <a href="Unit%20train">block trains</a> or in groups of wagons. With the abandonment of rail traffic between Werdau and Wünschendorf (Elster), the station was closed on 30 May 1999. It is located on the outskirts of the Thuringian village of Teichwolframsdorf in the Werdau forest.

The border with Saxony runs parallel with the railway to its east. the railway line was also the border between the Grand Duchy of <a href="Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach">Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach</a> (the Free State of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach from 1918 to 1920) and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Saxony">Kingdom of Saxony</a> (also a Free State for a time from 1918 and again since 1990). Between 1920 and 1953, the station was on the Thuringian-Saxon border, then on the border of the districts ("Bezirke") of <a href="Bezirk%20Gera">Gera</a> and <a href="Bezirk%20Karl-Marx-Stadt">Karl-Marx-Stadt</a> until 1990.

Trünzig ()

The halt of "Trünzig" was opened on 18 May 1952. It is located between the towns of Trünzig in the west and Stöcken in the east on the road called "Stöckener Straße" to the west and "Landsteig" to the east. It was redesignated as a halt on 24 May 1998. In addition to a residence, it had a stone waiting-room.

Travelling towards Mehltheuer, "Trünzig" was the last stop on the Werdau–Wünschendorf (Elster) section in the district of Karl-Marx-Stadt between 1958 and 1990 and it has been the last stop in Saxony since 1990.

Seelingstädt (b Werdau) Hp ()

The halt of "Chursdorf" was opened on 1 July 1892 in Chursdorf, which is now a district of <a href="Seelingst%C3%A4dt">Seelingstädt</a>. The station was renamed "Chursdorf b Werdau" (Chursdorf near Werdau) in 1909. After the place was incorporated into Seelingstädt on 1 April 1939, it was renamed "Seelingstädt (b Werdau) Hp" on 15 May 1939. It was reclassified as a halt on 24 May 1998.

Seelingstädt (b Werdau) ()

"Seelingstädt (b Werdau)" station was opened on 29 August 1876 as a halt and was reclassified as a station in 1905. The station, which is about 2 kilometres north of the old centre of Seelingstädt, subsequently developed into the settlement of Bahnhof Seelingstädt (Seelingstädt station), which is now the largest district of Seelingstädt. The station has had the following names:

Seelingstädt station grew considerably in importance from the end of the 1950s as a result of <a href="uranium">uranium</a> mining in the <a href="Ronneburg%2C%20Thuringia">Ronneburg</a> district. The <a href="Wismut-Werkbahn">Wismut-Werkbahn</a> (Busmuth Industrial Railway), which was used for freight, branched from here <a href="Seelingst%C3%A4dt%E2%80%93Paitzdorf%20railway">to Paitzdorf</a>. With the abandonment of passenger traffic between Werdau and Wünschendorf (Elster), the station was converted into a freight yard on 30 May 1999.

Gauern ()

The halt of "Gauern" was opened on 1 Otober 1884 as a halt and was reclassified as a station in 1905. Until 1920 it was located in <a href="Saxe-Altenburg">Saxe-Altenburg</a>, but since then it has been in Thuringia.

The loading of the uranium ore mined in the open-cast mine of Culmitzsch began in 1957, and the transport for further processing to <a href="Lengenfeld">Lengenfeld</a>, Dresden-Gittersee, <a href="Tannenbergsthal">Tannenbergsthal</a> andCrossen bei Zwickau began. A 2.2 kilometre-long connecting railway was opened from Gauern to the Culmitzsch loading yard on 11 September 1958; this was closed in 1966

Services stopped serving the station on 24 May1998, a year before the end of passenger traffic between Werdau and Wünschendorf (Elster).

Wolfersdorf (Kr Greiz) ()

The halt of "Wolfersdorf (Kr Greiz)" was opened on 1 October 1905. Until 1920, it was located in the Grand Duchy and later Free State of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and had the following names:


Services stopped serving the station on 24 May 1998, a year before the end of passenger traffic between Werdau and Wünschendorf (Elster).

Endschütz ()

"Endschütz" station was opened on 1 October 1893. It was a halt until 1905 and a station until 1974 and has been a halt since then. Services stopped serving the station on 24 May 1998, a year before the end of passenger traffic between Werdau and Wünschendorf (Elster). The red-brick entrance building still exists.

Civil engineering.
Oschütztal Viaduct

The viaduct over the Oschütz valley ("Oschütztal") in Weida is the longest and most important bridge construction on the line. The 185 metre-long and 28 metre-high <a href="truss%20bridge">truss bridge</a> is designed as a pendulum pillar viaduct ("Pendelpfeilerviadukt") and is now under heritage protection. Since 1983 it has not been used for structural reasons and the junction has been moved further south.

Tunnels

The railway line now has two tunnels, the 79 metre-long Schlossberg Tunnel between Weida Mitte and Weida Altstadt and the 71 metre-long Vipsberg Tunnel between Weida Altstadt and Loitsch-Hohenleuben. The 97 metre-long Schüptitz Tunnel was converted into a cutting in 1929, because otherwise an expensive partial restoration would have been necessary. The removed rock has been safely secured in the sides of the cutting.

Rolling stock use.
Passenger transport on both sections of the line were dominated in the 1990s by <a href="DR%20Class%20119">class 219</a> locomotives, or in their absence by <a href="DR%20Class%20V%20100">class 202</a> locomotives. For additional capacity these were augmented by <a href="DB%20Class%20628">class 628</a> sets. From 1992 onwards, class 220 locomotives were originally used between Weida and Mehltheuer to haul sand trains for the upgrade of the Plauen–Hof line and a little later shared the haulage of tank-wagons with class 219 locomotives. From 1997 until 1999, a train of milk wagons ran to and from Italy, hauled by two locomotives of class 219, <a href="DR%20Class%20130%20family">class 232</a> or one of each. From 1997 onwards locomotives of <a href="DB%20Class%20V%20100">classes 211 and 212</a> were used for operations to Weida; among the most prominent of them was locomotive V 100 1023, which was destroyed in the fire at the DB Museum in Nuremberg in 2005.

<a href="DB%20Class%20218">Class 218</a> locomotives were used on the line to haul the "Vier-Länder-Express". The Regional-Express services which have run since December 2006 are operated with <a href="DBAG%20Class%20612">class 612</a> sets. The Regionalbahn 103 service is operated with <a href="Siemens%20Desiro">Siemens Desiro</a> Classic (class 642) sets. The "Erfurter Bahn" uses <a href="Stadler%20Regio-Shuttle%20RS1">Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1</a> sets.

In freight, a train hauled by a <a href="DR%20Class%20V%20100">class 203</a> locomotive, a diesel-electric <a href="Eurorunner">Siemens ER20</a> locomotive of the EVU Unterwellenborn steelworks or a <a href="Vossloh%20G1700%20BB">Vossloh G 1700</a> diesel-hydraulic locomotive has run on working days since 2008 from "Stahlwerks Thüringen" (Thuringian Steel) towards the Czech Republic.

Morris Fourteen

Morris Fourteen was the name given to two <a href="automobile">motor cars</a> that were produced by <a href="Morris%20Motors">Morris</a> of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> from 1936 to 1939. 

Series II and Series III models.
Morris Fourteen Series II.
Available as a 4-door saloon, the Fourteen had a Morris QSDM 6-cylinder side-valve engine displacing 1,818cc, and achieving 14.07hp (RAC). It was available with a 3 or 4 speed gearbox. 

It was released a year later than the other models (with different engine and body sizes) that were collectively known as the "Series II" Morris range.

Morris Fourteen Series III.
The Fourteen Series III was launched together with the Ten, Twelve, and Twenty Five at the 1937 Motor Show.

The Morris Fourteen Series III is most readily distinguished in having a painted, rather than chromed, radiator cowl — as also happened with its larger sibling, the <a href="Morris%20Big%20Six">Morris Twenty-Five</a>.

Another similarity to the Twenty-Five's progression from Series II to Series III is that the engine became an overhead valve unit, while maintaining the same displacement and power as its predecessor.

The Series III also gained covers for its glove compartments.

Crayon (song)

"Crayon" () is a song recorded by South Korean singer-rapper <a href="G-Dragon">G-Dragon</a>, serving as the third single of his first extended play "<a href="One%20of%20a%20Kind%20%28EP%29">One of a Kind</a>" (2012). It was written and produced by G-Dragon and <a href="Teddy%20Park">Teddy Park</a>.

Composition.
"Crayon" is mix between hip-hop and electronic music. The title is a neologism made on the coumpound word "Crazy On". The track was noted to showcase the experimental mind of the composers.

Critical reception.
"<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" named "Crayon" the best K-pop single of 2012, with David Bevan commenting that the track "almost felt too big for the occasion, too brash to have come from the leader of a boy band." Corban Goble of "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" called "Crayon" "magnificent" writing the song represents "a logical collision of fluorescent, pound-the-alarm EDM, the tomahawk chop chant, and G-Dragon's referential, sharp rapping; every element throbbed with electricity."

David Jeffries of <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> deemed the track "kinetic", feeling that it comes off "as a top production that somehow escaped the house of <a href="Mad%20Decent">Mad Decent</a> while <a href="Diplo">Diplo</a> was sleeping." Jon Caramanica of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that "Crayon" is "pneumatic-intensity thumper with a Southern rap backbone" and added the song setted "an almost impossibly high bar." Nick Catucci of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" gave the single three out of five stars.

Jeff Benjamin of <a href="Fuse%20%28TV%20channel%29">Fuse</a> considered "Crayon" "one of G-Dragon's signature tracks", writing that the single's "crazy dance joint is guaranteed to make" audience in live performances "go nuts". E. Alex Jung of "<a href="Vulture.com">Vulture.com</a>" felt that the track was "the best example of his chameleonic power" since it "demonstrated his ability to metabolize pop culture and fashion on a global scale and reform it into his own aesthetic."

Commercial performance.
Been released in the last day of the tracking week, "Crayon" managed to debut at number 13 in the <a href="Gaon%20Digital%20Chart">Gaon Digital Chart</a>. The following week, the single rose to a peak position of number 3, charting behind G-Dragon's own song "Missing You". That week, "Crayon" was the third best selling song and the second most streamed, with 363,647 downloads and 2,251,773 audio streams. The single remained at the Top 3 for two more weeks. In the Gaon Digital Monthly chart, "Crayon" charted at number eight for two consecutive months. The single finished 2012 whit 1,746,682 downloads sold and over 20 million streams.

Music video.
In the music video for "Crayon", G-Dragon transforms himself into several characters: a doctor, a stylist, a book-lover boy, among others. He is seen with multiple hairstyles, in several shades, such as pink, orange, neon yellow and a multicoloured "cotton candy" hair.

Jon Caramanica of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described the video as a "cultural treasure — hilarious, dizzying, and full of retina-frying explosions of color." "Star2.com" hailed the video "kaleidoscopic" with "head-turning" features and "larger-than-life outfits". E. Alex Jung from "<a href="Vulture.com">Vulture.com</a>" felt that the music video was "full of jokes", with "nods to Korea's burgeoning fast-fashion industry", in the opening with "a popping pink <a href="Wonder%20Woman">Wonder Woman</a> robe before moving to jackets in holographic gold" to "<a href="Thom%20Browne">Thom Browne</a>'s 2012 fall collection with its fun-house proportions." Jung also noted that the music video references to <a href="the%20Joker">the Joker</a> of the movie "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>" and G-Dragon appearing "in drag" are questioning the viewer "why are we taking any of this so seriously?". <a href="Fuse%20%28TV%20channel%29">Fuse</a> chose "Crayon" as one of the rapper's "must-see music videos".

Live performances.
G-Dragon performed "Crayon", along with other tracks from his EP, on the talk show <a href="You%20Hee-yeol%27s%20Sketchbook">You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook</a>. His appearance on the show resulted in an increase of 75% in the demand for audience tickets. The rapper then performed the single on the <a href="Music%20programs%20of%20South%20Korea">music show</a> "<a href="Inkigayo">Inkigayo</a>" to positive reception. "<a href="The%20Korea%20Herald">The Korea Herald</a>" hailed these performances an "joyfull adventure" to the audience. The members of G-Dragon's group, <a href="Big%20Bang%20%28South%20Korean%20band%29">Big Bang</a>, performed an remake of the song in the <a href="2012%20Mnet%20Asian%20Music%20Awards">2012 Mnet Asian Music Awards</a>. <a href="T.O.P%20%28rapper%29">T.O.P</a> wrote new raps for the first verse, <a href="Daesung">Daesung</a> sang the first chorus, <a href="Taeyang">Taeyang</a> rapped in the second verse and <a href="Seungri">Seungri</a> joined for the second chorus. During his <a href="One%20of%20a%20Kind%20World%20Tour">first world tour</a>, G-Dragon performed a hybrid remix version of "Crayon" with Big Bang's single <a href="Fantastic%20Baby">Fantastic Baby</a>.

P.A.R.T.S.

P.A.R.T.S. ("Performing Arts Research and Training Studios") is an international school for <a href="contemporary%20dance">contemporary dance</a> that is located in <a href="Forest%2C%20Belgium">Vorst</a>, one of the 19 municipalities located in the <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>-Capital Region of Belgium. 

History.
The school was founded in 1995 by the Belgian choreographer <a href="Anne%20Teresa%20De%20Keersmaeker">Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Foccroulle">Bernard Foccroulle</a>, then director of the national opera <a href="La_Monnaie">De Munt</a>. They initiated P.A.R.T.S. to fill the gap in professional training for contemporary dance. Their intention was to provide a pedagogical anchoring for contemporary dance in Belgium, which had started in the early 1980s and had seen a quick and strong development since then. At that time, there were only a few institutions in Europe that resolutely focused on these new artistic developments. 

"At that time, contemporary Belgian dance was already internationally well-respected. But there was no longer a school to pass along that experience. That's why De Keersmaeker decided to set up P.A.R.T.S.”, said deputy director Theo Van Rompay in an interview in 2012. In 1988, <a href="Maurice%20B%C3%A9jart">Maurice Béjart</a>'s dance school Mudra in Brussels had closed. In 1992, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker became the choreographer-in-residence at the national opera De Munt and one of her ambitions was to answer the lack in educational possibilities for contemporary dance. Prior to the start of P.A.R.T.S. in 1995, Rosas, the dance company of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, and De Munt had already been organizing a dance course for students from different countries for a couple of years. With P.A.R.T.S., they wanted to give that dance education a permanent character.

Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker expressed the philosophy, ambition and spirit of P.A.R.T.S. as follows: “I cannot teach anyone to dance. One learns to dance oneself. But perhaps I can give them a desire, an experience, create a space for challenges.”
In 2000, deputy director Theo Van Rompuy summarized the objectives of the school as follows: “Firstly, there is the basic need to provide training for contemporary dance. Secondly, we want to create an instrument to pass on the knowledge and information resulting from the turbulent development of Belgian dance. The intention is always to connect with living practice at home and abroad. To this end, we confront the young dancer during the training with work by <a href="William_Forsythe_%28choreographer%29">William Forsythe</a>, <a href="Pina%20Bausch">Pina Bausch</a>, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, <a href="Wim%20Vandekeybus">Wim Vandekeybus</a>, <a href="Meg%20Stuart">Meg Stuart</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Droulers">Pierre Droulers</a>, as a landmark. It is all strong material that is obviously proven on the stage, and precisely because of this, the student will benefit from it, but he must also position himself, in relation to or in conflict with it. It is never the intention to form followers of any kind according to a particular model, but to train physically and technically good dancers and choreographers who develop their own language, their own voice.”

The first generation of P.A.R.T.S. students graduated in 1998, a group of dancers and choreographers who immediately found work in the main dance companies or attracted public and critical attention with their own creations. Among them were Heine Avdal, Alix Eynaudi, Thomas Plischke, Arco Renzand Salva Sanchis, who have all made an international career as choreographers since then. 

When P.A.R.T.S. existed 20 years in 2015, the school announced that approximately 860 students, teachers and staff had been involved with the school since its start in 1995. P.A.R.T.S. and HES-SO/Manufacture, the High School of Performing Arts that is part of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland (Lausanne), are 2013-2017 partner institutions for higher education in contemporary dance.

Pedagogical curriculum.
Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker was inspired by Mudra, where she had been a student herself, and which had moved with Béjart to Switzerland. "Mudra was accomodated in an enormous hangar where also the <a href="Ballet%20of%20the%2020th%20Century">Ballet of the 20th Century</a> (Note: the company of choreographer <a href="Maurice%20B%C3%A9jart">Maurice Béjart</a>) rehearsed. The idea of ​​the choreographer was to train dancers who would have a look at other disciplines. Among the teachers, there were great people like Fernand Schirren (rhythm and percussion) and Alfons Goris (theatre acting). It was a gathering place for young people from all over the world, a meeting place for different generations of dancers and choreographers. There was both rigor and anarchy. It was a crucial place for me." As Mudra shared its housing with the Ballet of the 20th century, today P.A.R.T.S. shares its accommodation with Rosas and <a href="Ictus%20Ensemble">Ictus</a>, the contemporary music ensemble. Mudra teacher Fernand Schirren even became one of the teachers at P.A.R.T.S.. And like Mudra, P.A.R.T.S. has become a meeting place for different generations of dancers and choreographers from all over the world.

Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker designed the pedagogical curriculum of P.A.R.T.S.. Originally, the program lasted three years. This changed in 2000, when some changes were made and the program was extended, with the option to specialize as a dancer or as a choreographer. The pedagogical curriculum currently consists of two independent parts (called cycles). The first part is the "Training Cycle" which lasts three years and forms the basis of the course. The second part is the subsequent "Research Studios", which lasts two years. 

The program consists of a foundation that links technical training with attention to body awareness, theatrical and musical education, as well as theoretical concepts. The research section emphasizes the own creative work. Creation is one of the essential goals of P.A.R.T.S.. Therein it distinguishes itself for example from classical ballet training, that, according deputy director Theo Van Rompuy, is focused more on technique. "Ballet has a different finality. The movement language in dance is much looser. [...] It is a good exercise for the body. But technique is not decisive for us. We are looking for dancers who exhale the spirit of an artist. [...] We are not looking for executors of someone else's ideas. We are looking for people who have ideas themselves."Our ambitions for and vision on the education of young dancers are still the same as ten years ago. We do not educate dancers or choreographers, but more dancemakers.The distinction between thought and execution has disappeared. In the school there is much more emphasis today on the production and organization of the performances that our students create."

During the program, much attention is paid to the repertoire of Rosas, the dance company of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. Each year students learn one complete Rosas choreography. In addition, the repertoire of other contemporary choreographers is addressed, such as Pina Bausch, William Forsythe and <a href="Trisha%20Brown">Trisha Brown</a>.

International renown.
P.A.R.T.S. has achieved international renown with its students and teachers from more than twenty countries, mainly Europe and the United States. 

However, at its founding in 1995, the influential French critic Jean-Marc Adolphe claimed that the idea for the school was not good and that it would only be a training college for Rosas. Six years later, he revised his opinion. Together with Alain Crombecque, director of the Festival d’Automne, he invited the school for a one-month stay at the Théâtre de la Bastille and the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20du%20Rond-Point">Théâtre du Rond-Point</a> in Paris. According to Alain Crombecque they considered the activity carried out by P.A.R.T.S. since 1995 in Brussels as exemplary, and they considered it important to testify about it in France. This initiative was repeated during the 2010 edition of the Festival d’Automne.

The P.A.R.T.S. students regularly present their work to the audience. They do not only do this at the P.A.R.T.S. studios in Brussels, but also at wide range of theatres and art centres in Belgium and abroad (amongst others at the Kaaitheater in Brussels, <a href="Vooruit">Vooruit</a> and CAMPO in <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>, DE Studio and Monty in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, STUK in <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a>, De Brakke Grond in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, PACT Zollverein in <a href="Essen">Essen</a>, Plac Wolnosci/ Malta Festival in <a href="Poznan">Poznan</a> and Mimar Sinan University Bomonti Campus in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>). 

In 2010, P.A.R.T.S. received the Silver Lion for Dance at the 7th International Festival of Contemporary Dance of the <a href="Venice%20Biennale">Venice Biennale</a>. The jury awarded P.A.R.T.S. the prize for its study program. The motivation of the Silver Lion award reads as follows: “Instituted rather recently (1995), the P.A.R.T.S acquired immediate recognition throughout Europe as a center of pedagogical innovation, with a complete and intensive program of studies in which the most advanced techniques of contemporary dance dialogue with other artistic disciplines, in particular with theatre and music. A laboratory of movement which focuses not only on the development of the dancer’s skills, but on his search for artistic identity as well.”

Some renowned alumni.
Some well-known alumni who graduated from P.A.R.T.S., are:

Financial support.
Since 1998, P.A.R.T.S. receives grants from the Ministry of Education of the Flemish Community of Belgium. From 2002, this is arranged through contractual agreements that are renewed five-yearly. The school currently receives additional funding from the netwerk "[DNA] Departures and Arrivals", that is co-financed by the European Commission (Creative Europe Program). Between 2001 and 2014 the school received additional funding from the DÉPARTS, that was also co-financed by the European Commission.

This book was conceived on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of P.A.R.T.S..
This book was conceived on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of P.A.R.T.S.. It comprises portraits of 50 P.A.R.T.S. students and an overview of the 860 students, teachers and staff who together have built out the school.

It has simple ovate leaves with entire margins, <a href="zygomorphic">zygomorphic</a>, spidery, greenish, yellowish, whitish or pinkish flowers, and is covered in powdery hairs or scales, particularly the younger parts. It can be found in a zone from Senegal to India between the desert and the savanna.

Description.
"Cadaba farinosa" is a usually much branched shrub, mostly high, but under favorable circumstances a shrub of or a tree up to . It has a smooth, reddish brown bark, while young branches appear powdery due to scales or short spreading hairs. The simple and entire leaves are alternate set along the branches, and have narrow, persistent stipules of up to 1½ mm (0.06 in) long, at both sides of an up to long <a href="Petiole">leaf stalk</a>, which carries an oblong or elliptical leaf blade of long and wide, rounded or pointed with a short stiff tip. When young, the leaves appear powdery, but they become gradually hairless. The central <a href="Leaf%23Veins">vein</a> that <a href="Pinnation">branches feather-like</a> into four to five pairs of side veins. The <a href="Floral%20symmetry%23Zygomorphic">bilaterally symmetric</a> flowers are arranged individually or with a few together in small <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s at the tip of the side branches. The flowers have <a href="Hermaphrodite%23Botany">both stamens and a pistel</a>. Each sits on a long <a href="Pedicel%20%28botany%29">flower stalk</a>, has four, somewhat unequal, elliptical <a href="sepal">sepal</a>s that fall after flowering. The outer sepals are long, concave particularly near the tip, that appears pointed because the margins are foulded against each other. The inner sepals are almost flat and have a stump tip. The four petals, which fall earlier than the sepals, are approximately long, and consist of a <a href="Glossary%20of%20leaf%20morphology%23linear">linear</a>, up-curved <a href="Petal%23Shape%20and%20size">claw</a> of long, that gradually passes into a wider, creamy, yellowish or dirty pink colored, <a href="Glossary%20of%20leaf%20morphology%23oblanceolate">oblanceolate</a> long <a href="Petal%23Shape%20and%20size">blade</a>. The base of the (four or) five stamens and the pistol have merged into a horizontally oriented 4–5 mm long <a href="wikt%3Aandrogynophore">androgynophore</a>, with the free upper parts of the filaments long and carrying 3½ mm (0.14 in) long, very quickly falling <a href="Stamen%23Morphology%20and%20terminology">anther</a>s. At the base of the androgynophore, there is at a right angle an upwardly directed tube-shaped appendage of long, colored like the petals. The <a href="Ovary%20%28botany%29">ovary</a>, that contains one cavity, sits on a stalk on top of the androgynophore (called <a href="gynophore">gynophore</a>) and has a cylinder shape. After ferilisation, this develops into a powdery cylindrical capsule of long and about in diameter, with many seeds and slight constricted between these, which open with two valves from the base when ripe. Individual seeds are 2½–3 mm (0.10–0.12 in), rounded to kidney-shaped, and are embedded in an orange-red pulp. The nummer of chromosomes is thirty two (2n=32).

Phytochemistry.
"C. farinosa" contains <a href="Aliphatic%20compound">aliphatic</a> <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>s, <a href="glycoside">glycoside</a>s, <a href="wikt%3Aheteroside">heteroside</a>, <a href="nitrogenous%20base">nitrogenous base</a>s, <a href="saponin">saponin</a>s, <a href="steroid">steroid</a>s and <a href="sterol">sterol</a>s, while particularly the leaves contain <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a>s.

Taxonomy.
Based on a <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type</a> from Yemen, our plant was first described by <a href="Peter%20Forssk%C3%A5l">Peter Forsskål</a>, an early Swedish explorer, orientalist and naturalist, in his "Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica", that was published in 1775, and named "Cadaba farinosa". The Swiss botanist <a href="Augustin%20Pyramus%20de%20Candolle">Augustin Pyramus de Candolle</a> described a slightly different specimen in his <a href="Prodromus%20Systematis%20Naturalis%20Regni%20Vegetabilis">Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis</a> as "C. dubia" in 1824. In 1854, Ukrainian botanist <a href="Nikolai%20Turczaninow">Nikolai Turczaninow</a> described "C. miqueliana". <a href="Ernest%20Friedrich%20Gilg">Ernest Friedrich Gilg</a> and his wife <a href="Charlotte%20Gilg-Benedict">Charlotte Gilg-Benedict</a> distinguished in 1915 "C. mombassana". All of these are now considered <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a>. "C. adenotricha" and "C. apiculata" were also distinguished by Gilg. and Gilg-Ben. in 1915, based on the presence of <a href="Trichome%23Aerial%20surface%20hairs">glandular hairs</a>, but they were synonymised and demoted to the subspecies "adenotricha" in 1963 by R.A. Graham.

Etymology.
The genus name "Cadaba" is derived from the Arab word "kadhab", a local name for "Cadaba rotundifolia". The species <a href="epithet">epithet</a> is a contraction of the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "farīna" meaning "flour" or "meal”‎, and "-ōsos", a deflection meaning "full off".

Distribution, habitat and ecology.
This plant can be found in the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> and northern <a href="Sudanian%20Savanna">Sudanian Savanna</a> between Mauritania and Senegal in the West, along the Red Sea, through the <a href="Arabian%20peninsula">Arabian peninsula</a>, and the coast of the Indian Ocean all the way to India in the East. It is widespread in Africa, and may grow up to an altitude of . It is often found on termite mounds and grows together with "<a href="Maerua">Maerua</a>" species. This species grows in areas with a mean annual precipitation between and , and a temperature of approximately , and prefers heavy soils, although it also grows on stony scree and sand. The foliage is eaten by black rhinos, buffalos and hartebeasts. Butterflies of the genus "<a href="Colotis">Colotis</a>" feed on the leaves of Capparaceae, including those of "Cadaba farinosa".

Uses.
The wood is used for fuel. The leaves and young twigs of "Cadaba farinosa" are edible. In western Africa, leaves are squashed, boiled and eaten as a <a href="gruel">gruel</a>, sometimes mixed with <a href="couscous">couscous</a>. In northern Nigeria pounded leaves are mixed with cereals and dried to make irregularly shaped chocolate-brown cake, which is sold on markets called "farsa", "balambo", "baleno", "tsawa" (in <a href="Hausa%20language">Hausa</a>), or "tigiraganda". Macerated flowers are added to dough to make it sweeter. It is used as fodder by different types of husbandry and is one of the species preferred by camels in the North of Kenya. Leaves are reported to contain 15.2–18.2% crude protein, about 60-80% fibre and 7-8% ash. In traditional medicine in different parts of Africa and India, several parts of the plant are reported to be used, against infections such as of the skin and the intestines, food-poisoning, anthrax, dysenteria, intestinal worms, and against pain such as rheumatism.

Political career.
In interviews, Lin credited the end of official relations between Taiwan and the United States and the <a href="Kaohsiung%20Incident">Kaohsiung Incident</a>, both of which occurred in 1979, for increasing his interest in politics.

While serving on the Legislative Yuan, Lai was also president of the Taiwan Children's Rights Association. As a lawmaker and president of the association, he pushed the Executive Yuan to report on children's rights, child abuse, and child welfare.

Lai frequently supported a range of environmental causes, and was known for his opposition to nuclear energy. Lai often spoke out against the <a href="Longmen%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant">Longmen Nuclear Power Plant</a> project. In 2000, Lai co-authored a report advising against the use of nuclear energy, and, later that year, discussed with American scientists the risks of nuclear technology.

Lai was nominated for a second term on the Legislative Yuan in 2001, and won reelection as a DPP candidate. In 2002, Lai co-founded the Taiwan Renewable Energy Industry Promotion Association to advocate for use and research into sources of renewable energy. During Lai's second term, Lai helped write the Mass Layoff Protection Law. He also supported stronger ties between Liberia and Taiwan. Lai ended his 2004 legislative campaign during the party primary stage, and in June was named vice minister of the <a href="Council%20of%20Labor%20Affairs">Council of Labor Affairs</a>, where he served through the end of 2005.
