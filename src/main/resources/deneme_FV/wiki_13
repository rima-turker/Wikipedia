Thubten Kunphela

Thubten Kunphel (, 1905 – 1963), commonly known as Kunphela, was a Tibetan politician and one of the most powerful political figures in the Tibet during the later years of the <a href="13th%20Dalai%20Lama">13th Dalai Lama</a>'s rule, known as the "stong man of Tibet". Kunphela was arrested and exiled after the death of the Dalai Lama in 1933. He later escaped to India and became a co-founder of the India-based <a href="Tibet%20Improvement%20Party">Tibet Improvement Party</a> with the aim of establishing a secular government in Tibet. He worked in Nanking after the attempt to start a revolution in Tibet failed, and returned to Tibet in 1948.

Rise to power.
Kunphela was born as Dechen Chödrön in a "taxpayer" serf family in <a href="Ny%C3%AAmo%20County">Nyemo</a> in 1905. At the age of 12, he was sent to <a href="Lhasa">Lhasa</a> as a servant in the palace of the <a href="13th%20Dalai%20Lama">13th Dalai Lama</a>. His intelligence gained the Dalai Lama's attention, and subsequently he became a household servant, and then the favorite personal attendant, known as "jensey". In the 1920s, he oversaw a series of construction tasks including the renovation of the <a href="Potala%20Palace">Potala Palace</a> and the expansion of <a href="Norbulingka">Norbulingka</a>. In 1931, he became the head of Trapchi Electrical Machine Office, in charge of several mints and munition factories that were considered the most modern ones of Tibet at the time.

In 1932, he successfully persuaded the Dalai Lama to allow him to establish a Trongdra Regiment under his control. The soldiers were recruited from middle-class families, and the equipment and training far exceeded other Tibetan troops. 

By 1933, Kunphela had gained the authority of appointing and dismissing government officials. He also controlled the importation and distribution of arms and ammunition. Kunphela issued orders without the need of confirmation of the <a href="Kashag">Kashag</a> or the Dalai Lama, and his orders were obeyed as much as those from the Dalai Lama himself. He was known as the "stong man of Tibet"

Downfall.
After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama in December 1933, Kunphela's status became unclear. Initially, Kunphela was confident of his position because of his control of the Trongdra Regiment. He held the power to organize the construction of the Dalai Lama's tomb, and a large part of lay officials present in the National Assembly, composing of government officials and abbots of key monasteries, supported him to become regent even though the position was traditionally for an incarnate lama.

In the meanwhile, <a href="Lungshar">Lungshar</a>, one of the parties vying for control after the 13th Dalai Lama's death, conspired to accuse Kunphela of playing a role in the sudden death of the Dalai Lama, and gathered the support of a large number of abbots and monks. The charge was also given support by several Lungshar's friends in the Kashag, who confirmed that only Kunphela accompanied the Dalai Lama all the time. In the meanwhile, Lungshar took advantage of the Trongdra soldiers' dissatisfaction and successfully persuaded them to mutiny. On the third day after death of the Dalai Lama, the entire regiment demonstrated before the Norbulingka and demanded its own disbandment. The regiment was then disbanded on the Kashag's order. 

After the desertion of the Trongdra Regiment, Kunphela was arrested and confined in the Sharcenchog prison. Lungshar sought to inflict death or mutilation on Kunphela, but the suggestion was opposed by the Assembly. Eventually, Kunphela was only convicted of failing to deliver prompt notification about the Dalai Lama's illness, and sentenced to exile for life to <a href="Kongpo">Kongpo</a>. He was banished in public on the second day before the <a href="Tibetan%20New%20Year">Tibetan New Year</a>, the most inauspicious day of the year. All his property and that of his relatives was confiscated. Kunphela's father was sent back to serve as a serf in Nyemo.

Founding of Tibet Improvement Party.
Kunphela fled to India in 1937 together with Canglocen, a well-known poet and ex-official who was exiled because of supporting Lungshar. In <a href="Kalimpong">Kalimpong</a>, they met <a href="Pandatsang%20Rapga">Pandatsang Rapga</a>, a <a href="Kham">Kham</a>ba nationalist and intellectual, and started the <a href="Tibet%20Improvement%20Party">Tibet Improvement Party</a> in 1939. According to Pandatsang, the primary goal of the party was "liberation of Tibet from the existing tyrannical government" and a revolution in Tibet for a secular government under the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a>.

In 1946, the activities of <a href="Gend%C3%BCn%20Ch%C3%B6phel">Gendün Chöphel</a>, a leading figure in the party, were discovered in Tibet. Under the pressure from the Tibetan Government, Kunphela became under surveillance of the Government of India after 1946 and was deported to China one year later. At the time, he was offered a position as a lecturer by <a href="Varanasi%20University">Varanasi University</a> which can allow him to legally remain in India. Kunphela refused and left for Shanghai in 1947.

Later life.
After the deportation, Kunphela lived in poverty in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> and <a href="Nanking">Nanking</a> for a while, but was eventually able to work for the <a href="Mongolian%20and%20Tibetan%20Affairs%20Commission">Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission</a> following an invitation.

In 1947, Kunphela discovered that the ex-regent of Tibet, <a href="Reting%20Rinpoche">Reting Rinpoche</a> <a href="Jamphel%20Yeshe%20Gyaltsen">Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen</a> was appealing to the Kuomintang government to overthrow the <a href="3rd%20Taktra%20Rinpoche">Taktra</a> Government in Tibet. Thubten Sangbo, the Tibetan Government's representative in Nanking, was informed. The news soon reached Lhasa, and led to Reting's arrest. Kunphela was allowed back to Lhasa in 1948, obviously because of his role in the Reting affair. According to Sampho Tenzin Dhondup, Kunphela's motive was a conflict from the time Kunphela worked for Reting's trade company in India: Kunphela made several purchases in Bombay, but was not reimbursed for his loss even though Reting's company was far from short of funds.

In 1952, Kunphela was one of the staff members of the Grain Procurement Bureau, an newly established institution under the Kashag for resolving the problem of grain shortage. In 1956, Kunphela became the deputy director of the Bureau of Geology under the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region (PCTAR). He attended the 8th anniversary celebrations of China in Beijing, and was received, along with other Tibetan visitors, by <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> and <a href="Zhou%20Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a>. Kunphela became vice-director of the Executive Office under the General Office of the Preparatory Committee. He died in Lhasa in December 22, 1963, aged 58.

<doc id="54895550" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54895550" title="Liquid-Phase Electron Microscopy">
Liquid-Phase Electron Microscopy

Liquid-phase electron microscopy (LP EM) refers to a class of methods for imaging specimens in liquid with nanometer spatial resolution using <a href="electron%20microscopy">electron microscopy</a>. LP-EM overcomes the key limitation of electron microscopy: since the electron optics requires a high vacuum, the sample must be stable in a vacuum environment. Many types of specimens relevant to biology, materials science, chemistry, geology, and physics, however, change their properties when placed in a vacuum.

The ability to study liquid samples, particularly those involving water, with electron microscopy has been a wish ever since the early days of electron microscopy but technical difficulties prevented early attempts from achieving high resolution . Two basic approaches exist for imaging liquid specimens: i) closed systems, mostly referred to as liquid cell EM (LC EM), and ii) open systems, often referred to as environmental systems. In closed systems, thin windows made of materials such as silicon nitride or graphene are used to enclose a liquid for placement in the microscope vacuum. Closed cells have found widespread use in the past decade due to the availability of reliable window microfabrication technology . Graphene provides the thinnest possible window . The oldest open system that gained widespread usage was <a href="environmental%20scanning%20electron%20microscopy">environmental scanning electron microscopy</a> (ESEM) of liquid samples on a cooled stage in a vacuum chamber containing a background pressure of vapor . Low vapor pressure liquids such as ionic liquids can also be studied in open systems . LP-EM systems of both open and closed type have been developed for all three main types of electron microscopy, i.e., <a href="transmission%20electron%20microscopy">transmission electron microscopy</a> (TEM), <a href="scanning%20transmission%20electron%20microscopy">scanning transmission electron microscopy</a> (STEM), and <a href="scanning%20electron%20microscope">scanning electron microscope</a> (SEM) . Instruments integrating liquid-phase SEM with light microscopy have also been developed . Electron microscopic observation in liquid has been combined with other analytical methods such as electrochemical measurements and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) .

The benefit of LP EM is the ability to study samples that do not withstand a vacuum or to study materials properties and reactions requiring liquid conditions. Examples of measurements enabled by this technique are the growth of metallic nanoparticles or structures in liquid , materials changes during the cycling of batteries , electrochemical processes such as metal deposition , dynamics of thin water films and diffusion processes , biomineralization processes , protein dynamics and structure , single-molecule localization of membrane proteins in mammalian cells , and the influence of drugs on receptors in cancer cells . 

The spatial resolution achievable can be in the sub-nanometer range and depends on the sample composition, structure and thickness, any window materials present, and the sensitivity of the sample to the electron dose required for imaging . Nanometer resolution is obtained even in micrometers-thick water layers for STEM of nanomaterials of high atomic number . STEM detection is also possible in ESEM . An important aspect of LP EM is the interaction of the electron beam with the sample since the electron beam initiates a complex sequence of radiolytic reactions in water . Nevertheless, quantitative analysis of LP EM data has yielded unique information in a range of scientific areas .

Eichener See

The Eichener See ("Lake Eichen"), known in the <a href="Alemannic%20dialect">Alemannic dialect</a> as the Eiemer See, near <a href="Eichen%20%28Schopfheim%29">Eichen</a> in the <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a> county of <a href="L%C3%B6rrach%20%28district%29">Lörrach</a> is a periodic ("astatic") <a href="karst%20lake">karst lake</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Black%20Forest">Southern Black Forest</a> in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>.

The lake, which only contains water when there is a high <a href="water%20table">water table</a>, lies in a hollow, a <a href="muschelkalk">muschelkalk</a>-<a href="karst">karst</a> basin. It has no surface inflow, its outflows are partly subterranean and partly through <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a>.

Location.
The Eichener See lies in the <a href="Southern%20Black%20Forest%20Nature%20Park">Southern Black Forest Nature Park</a> on the northeastern perimeter of the <a href="Dinkelberg">Dinkelberg</a> ridge between the nearby village of <a href="Eichen%20%28Schopfheim%29">Eichen</a> to the west, which is part of the municipality of <a href="Schopfheim">Schopfheim</a>, the municipality of <a href="Hasel%20%28Baden%29">Hasel</a> to the east-northeast and the town of <a href="Wehr%20%28Baden%29">Wehr</a> to the southeast. It is located 2.5 km west of <a href="Erdmanns%20Cave">Erdmanns Cave</a> ("Hasler Höhle") in a shallow valley around 350 metres south of the <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%20518">Bundesstraße 518</a>.

Geology and hydrology.
<a href="Geologically">Geologically</a> it is a <a href="doline">doline</a> which is periodically filled with water, particularly after snowmelt or after long periods of rain when the groundwater level reaches the surface. In dry periods, the depth of the <a href="water%20table">water table</a> may be up to 40 metres; the deepest point of the groundwater-storing basin lies about 48 metres below the earth's surface. The background to the large variations in water level are the caverns of the Dinkelberg (which consists mainly of <a href="muschelkalk">muschelkalk</a>) which can fill very quickly with water, but only empty slowly.

Biology.
The bed of the lake is colonised by rich <a href="Herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a> community of meadow flora. These may not be grazed or fertilised during dry periods. In the lake lives "<a href="Tanymastix%20lacunae">Tanymastix lacunae</a>" of the order of <a href="fairy%20shrimp">fairy shrimp</a>s (Anostraca). The drying out of the lake is essential for its <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>. This is the only confirmed place in Germany where it is found; there are only seven other sites for the species in the whole of Europe.

History.
The lake is first recorded in 1771, when five people were drowned in a <a href="capsized">capsized</a> boat. People also lost their lives in the lake in 1876 and 1910.

The first scientific description of the lake is probably the article "Von einem merkwürdigen See in der oberen Markgrafschaft Baden" ("About a notable lake in the upper Margraviate of Baden") by Heinrich Sander, which appeared in 1782 in the magazine, "Der Naturforscher". The lake has been protected since 1939 and, since 1983, has been designated a <a href="natural%20monument">natural monument</a> with an area of 3.75 hectares. In addition it is a <a href="Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation">Special Area of Conservation</a> at European level.

Extent over time.
In years when there is an especially heavy precipitation the (visible above ground) water level can rise to three meters and, within one to five weeks, the lake can reach a size of 250 metres long and 135 metres wide (c. 2.5 <a href="hectare">ha</a>). It can take from 8 to 160 days for the water to disappear again.

Zhaleh Alamtaj

Zhaleh Alamtaj Ghaemmaghami
Zhaleh Alamtaj Ghaemmaghami (Persian: ژاله عالم تاج قائم مقامی "[ transliteration further complicates and confuses matters: the (US) Library of Congress apparently goes for: ʻĀlamtāj Qāʼimʹmaqāmī (and Zhālah), while alternative Westernized spellings include Alamtaj Ghaemmaghami]") was born in 1883 in Farahan, Arak, Iran . She is one of the first female poets who showed her feminist attitudes in her poetry. She has written the Mirror of Dew. She finally died in 1947 in Iran.<br>

Life.
Zhaleh was born in 1883 in Farahan. She is the daughter of Gohar Malek and Mirza Fathollah. Mirza Fathollah was the great grandchild of Ghaemmagham Farhahi, the Iranian Prime Minister, briefly from 1834 to 1835. <br>
When Zhaleh was 5, she started learning reading Persian and Arabic, and studied other fields till 15. When she was 15, she moved to Tehran with her family in 1938. Her family forced her to marry her father's friend, Alimoradkhan Bakhtiari. Alimorad was working in the military. He was 40 years old. He had daughters from her ex-wife. When Zhaleh married him, the daughters were older than her. After their coercive marriage, Zhaleh gave birth to Hossein Pezhman Bakhtiari. After two or three years, Zhaleh got divorced. At first, Hossein lived with his father until he became 27. Then he lived with his mother till the end of his life. <br>

Asghar Seyed-Gohrab says, "Zhale was married off, at fifteen, to a man she loathed. The cultured and well-educated young woman was completely mismatched with the much older military man, who already had other wives. The death of her parents during the first year of her marriage, and the birth of a son, presumably compounded the trauma. She did then soon divorce the man." <br>

After her divorce, Zhaleh continued living in Farahan. Her departure from her child had impacts on her emotions. Her feelings, depression, and gloomy life are all seen in her poems. Her personal hidden feelings are reflected in one of her poems about her son. So, subjectivity and womanhood were first founded in Zhaleh's poems. <br>

She finally died at the age of 63, at 1 P.M, 27 September, 1947. She was buried in Imamzadeh Hassan, in the west of Tehran. 
Zhaleh was one of the critical and idealistic female poets. When she was 23, the Persian Constitutional Revolution took place. During that period of time, the society held conservative views towards women, as well as their social activities. This made her portray her protesting voice against the submissive role of women in her poetry. This way, she helped women of her time get rid of the limitations. Her poetry was concerned about patriarchal society which suppressed women and deprived them of their rights. <br>

Works.
She was the first female poet who dared to talk about her personal problems. Her poetry was not published for many years. She wrote them for herself. Even she buried a noticeable number of her poems. After so many years, finally her son collected her poems and got them published. Asghar Seyed- Gohrab writes that she denied that she was a poet even though a few of her works were published in 1993. He suggests, "She might be called the Emily Dickinson of Persian poetry"1<br>

Her poetry is mostly autobiographical, a reflection of the tragedies and hardships that she went through in her personal life. She aimed to describe her protest against those stereotypes, beliefs, and expectations with regards to defending women rights. In her poetry, she portrays women's struggles with inequality between the genders in terms of positions and rights.<br>

Zhaleh was an introspected poet; even though she lived in melancholy and gloomy situations, she wrote her poems while breaking the stereotypes and traditions about women. She hid her poetic skills during her life even from her son, Pezhman. As Pezhman puts, she lately spent her life reading books about Literature, History, and Astronaut.<br>

According to the researches in national magazines, there were a few or no researches about her works and poetry. Even the feminist scholars and researchers did not pay enough attention to her. However, among all the articles and researches, Maryam Khalili Jahantigh and Mahsa Ghadir wrote an article comparing Zhaleh and Emily Dickinson's life and poetry. Based on the article, there are similarities between the two poets in part of their life and experiences, as well as poetry. <br>

List of some of her works.
• Reproach to my Husband<br>

• Message to the Unborn<br>

• What Would Have Happened?<br>

What Would Have Happened?
Below you can find a part of one of her poems translated into English and Persian.

What Would Have Happened
O mother, what would have happened if I had not gotten a husband?

What would have happened if I had not gotten caught in misfortune?

If a story-teller had told a tale about my ill fortune,

I swear by that ill fortune, I would have not believed it.
Was I such a heavy burden? Would my handful of bones 

Have bent my father’s back if I hadn’t gotten a husband? 

What would you say I was at the banquet spread of our family’s life?

A little cat who would have asked for nothing other than a morsel to eat."
"Zhâleh Qâ’em’maqâmi’s “Cheh Mishod” [What Would Have Happened] (pp. 54–5 in Mirror of Dew)

چه میشد "

چه می شد آخر ای مادر اگر شوهر نمی کردم 

گرفتار بلا خود را چه می شد گر نمی کردم 

گر از بدبختی ام افسانه خواندی داستان گویی 

به بدبختی قسم کان قصّه را باور نمی کردم 

مگر باری گران بودیم و مشت استخوان ما 

پدر را پشت خم می کرد اگر شوهر نمی کردم 

بران گسترده خوان گویی چه بودم گربه ای کوچک 

که غیر از لقمه ای نان خواهش دیگر نمی کردم

Wahbememe Burial Site and Monument

The Wahbememe Burial Site and Monument, also known as the Chief White Pigeon Monument, is a monument located at the junction of U.S. Routes <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">12</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">131</a> near <a href="White%20Pigeon%2C%20Michigan">White Pigeon, Michigan</a>. Is is the burial place of <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a> chief Wahbememe (White Pigeon), who died in approximately 1830. It was placed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1995. The location is now the Wahbememe Memorial Park.

Description.
The burial site of Wahbememe is on a low rise, located in a small park. It shares the park with memorials honoring fallen soldiers.

The monument is eight feet tall, and consists of a granite boulder supported by a concrete base. The base is three blocks high, with a slanting cap transitioning from a wider, two-block high lower section to an upper section a single block high. One side of the boulder is smoothed, and carries the inscription: 

The base below carries the additional inscription:

History.
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Potawatomi controlled a large territory around the southern portion of <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>, including this area. Around the turn of the century, Wahbememe (White Pigeon) was the chief of a village located west of here, near the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">St. Joseph River</a>, and was one of the signers of the 1795 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Greenville">Treaty of Greenville</a>. During the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, when the Potawatomi alied with the British, Wahbememe reportedly served as a messenger between local Potawatomi bands and <a href="Main%20Poc">Main Poc</a> and <a href="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>. He was captured by American forces in 1815. Nothing more is known about Wahbememe, save that he died some time before the first European settlers arrived in the White Pigeon area in 1827.

White Pigeon was the first permanent settlement in southern Michigan outside of Wayne and Washtenaw counties. The first settlers arrived in 1827, and <a href="White%20Pigeon%20Township">White Pigeon Township</a> was organized in 1829. That same year, a Mr. Earl claimed the lot of land on which this site is located, and was told by the Potawatomi that Wahbememe was buried there. Earl built a house at the location, and the Potawatomi promptly burned it leading Earl to build elsewhere and mark the spot with a poplar tree.

Although the grave was a well-known landmark to the earliest settlers (indeed, the May 29, 1839, "White Pigeon Republican" contained a short story on the gravesite), a tradition arose that in about 1830 Wahbememe attended a council in the <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> area, and, learning of an planned Indian attack on the White Pigeon settlement, ran straight to White Pigeon to warn the settlers. After arriving in time, he then collapsed and died. This story, although commemorated on the monument, is unlikely to be true, as Wahbememe's grave existed when White Pigeon was first settled.

By 1877, the local populace considered erecting a monument at the grave site. Although there was some talk of doing so, nothing concrete occurred until 1909, when the Alba Columba Club, a White Pigeon women's club, raised funds to construct a monument. A boulder was hauled to the site, and the monument was unveiled on August 10, 1909, by six-year old Willie White Pigeon, a direct descendant of Wahbememe, in front of a crowd of over 4000 people.

The monument, however, still stood on private property. In 1922, the owners, Albert G. and Claudia E. Wade, conveyed an easement on a small parcel to the St. Joseph County Board of Road Commissioners to create a park. The county created what is now the Wahbememe Memorial Park at the site. In 1986, the farm which the site was part of was parceled out to make an industrial park, and the new owners deeded the park property to the St. Joseph County Historical Society. The monument was rededicated on July 11, 1987.

Twig of the wish

A Twig of a Wish is a poem by <a href="Parvin%20E%27tesami">Parvin E'tesami</a>.

Historical and Cultural Moment.
In “A Twig of a Wish,”(Persian: نهال آرزو) <a href="Parvin%20E%27tesami">Parvin Etesami</a> complains about the lack of respect and opportunities for woman. She asserts women’s importance in pointing out that women are in charge of nurturing and educating all children (male and female), they should have greater respect and an equal chance for education as men. Her poem “A Twig of a Wish” was written when it was not unusual for women to be forced into marriages at young ages. Women's lives were very restricted during that time in Iran, and poetry was the only art in which a woman could express her thoughts and feelings. In such an atmosphere, Etesami and other early modern women writers in Iran provided a strong feminist claim for women’s rights. <br>

About A Twig of a Wish.
Etesami's poem “A Twig of a Wish” was written for her high school graduation ceremony from the Iran Bethel School in the spring of 1924. To the assembled audience at the girls’ school’s ceremony, it was daring for Etesami to speak out directly about the importance of women’s education and rights just before and during the <a href="Reza%20Shah%20Pahlavi">Reza Shah</a> era. What can be learned from her poems is that she had passion to learn and was aware of social issues. Her poems are full of spiritual truth and sympathy for the poor and the oppressed.
<a href="Parvin%20E%27tesami">Parvin Etesami</a> (1907-1941) grew up in an intellectual environment under supervision of her father who had a literary personality. That is why she became familiar with the thoughts of literary society. She married her father’s cousin who was much older than her and soon after got divorced for his addition to drug and corruption. Her husband didn’t let her write poets. After her divorce, her poets were published in <a href="Bahar%20%28newspaper%29">Bahar magazine</a>.<br>

His masterpiece is the basilica of <a href="Ta%27%20Pinu">Ta' Pinu</a> in Gozo, while other notable works include the domes of the <a href="Parish%20Church%20of%20St.%20Cajetan%2C%20%C4%A6amrun">Ħamrun</a> and <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Nicholas%2C%20Si%C4%A1%C4%A1iewi">Siġġiewi parish churches</a>, <a href="Villa%20Rosa%20%28St.%20Julian%27s%29">Villa Rosa</a> and the now-demolished <a href="Casa%20Said">Casa Said</a>.

Biography.
Vassallo was born in the town of <a href="Luqa">Luqa</a> on 2 January 1856. He initially worked as a stone sculptor, but by 1887 he had been involved in many aspects of the construction industry, including designing, building or remodeling various buildings and structures to a variety of patrons. He entered government service on 21 December 1887, taking over the late <a href="Webster%20Paulson">Webster Paulson</a>'s post of Clerk of Works. In 1892, he was admitted into the Institution of British Civil Engineers on the recommendation of Sir <a href="Lintorn%20Simmons">Lintorn Simmons</a> and Sir <a href="Osbert%20Chadwick">Osbert Chadwick</a>. He became a Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> in 1907, and was finally granted the Warrant of Land Surveyor and Architect on 7 November 1908. This was condemned by the "Istituto dei Periti" since Vassallo had never formally studied architecture.

Vassallo was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Gregory%20the%20Great">Order of St. Gregory the Great</a> by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20X">Pope Pius X</a> for his services during the Eucharistic Congress of 1913, for which he had designed a tribune.

Works.
Vassallo designed or was involved in the construction of many buildings and structures, including hospitals, schools, workshops and houses, and he used various architectural styles throughout his career. One of his notable works was a wrought iron conservatory at the <a href="Argotti%20Botanic%20Gardens">Argotti Botanic Gardens</a>, which was built sometime before 1907. This was a unique structure in Malta, but it was later demolished due to high maintenance costs. Vassallo also designed the <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical</a> Sliema Government Elementary School, which was built in around 1908–10.

Residential buildings designed by Vassallo include a <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Neo-Gothic</a> house located near the <a href="St.%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Mdina">Mdina Cathedral</a>. Its design was well received by the public, but it was also criticized since its style does not blend well with its surroundings. He also designed two <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> houses which were built in the 1920s: <a href="Villa%20Rosa%20%28St.%20Julian%27s%29">Villa Rosa</a> in <a href="St.%20Julian%27s">St. Julian's</a> and the now-demolished <a href="Casa%20Said">Casa Said</a> in <a href="Sliema">Sliema</a>.

In the 1920s, Vassallo won a competition for the design of the dome of the <a href="Parish%20Church%20of%20St.%20Cajetan%2C%20%C4%A6amrun">Parish Church of St. Cajetan</a> in <a href="%C4%A6amrun">Ħamrun</a>, which would eventually be built in 1953–55 under the direction of Guzè D'Amato. Despite being constructed decades after his death, the dome was built to his original designs with structural alterations made by D'Amato. This is regarded as being one of the finest domes in Malta. Vassallo also designed the dome of the <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Nicholas%2C%20Si%C4%A1%C4%A1iewi">Church of St. Nicholas</a> in <a href="Si%C4%A1%C4%A1iewi">Siġġiewi</a> (1919), the <a href="Rococo%20Revival">Rococo Revival</a> Church of the Madonna tal-Ħerba in <a href="Birkirkara">Birkirkara</a>, and the <a href="Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture">Neo-Romanesque</a> basilica of <a href="Ta%27%20Pinu">Ta' Pinu</a> in Gozo. The latter is regarded as Vassallo's masterpiece due to its monumentality and intricate design, although it is sometimes criticized as being alien in its surroundings.

Vassallo died on 28 January 1928 at the Zammit Clapp Hospital, which he had designed himself in 1910. His son, Edwin Vassallo, was also an architect. Vassallo's legacy is sometimes overlooked since many of his buildings are often wrongly attributed to other architects.

Ingenheim (Billigheim-Ingenheim)

Ingenheim is a village belonging to the municipality of <a href="Billigheim-Ingenheim">Billigheim-Ingenheim</a> in the district <a href="S%C3%BCdliche%20Weinstra%C3%9Fe">Südliche Weinstraße</a> (Southern Wine Route) in the <a href="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. Up to 1969, Ingenheim had been an autonomous borough. 

Geography.
The village lies in the Southern Palatinate, part of it belongs to the nature preserve "Klingbachtal-Kaiserbachtal". North of the village centre runs the <a href="Klingbach">Klingbach</a>. The region belongs to the <a href="Upper%20Rhine%20Plain">Northern Rhine Rift Valley</a>. Ingenheim lies southwest of the district of Billigheim and south of the district of Appenhofen. Federal road no. 38 connects the village to the central towns of <a href="Landau">Landau in der Pfalz</a> and <a href="Bad%20Bergzabern">Bad Bergzabern</a>.

Various dwelling places, like Dorfmühle, Friedrichshof, Im alten Grund, Im Peterswingert, Kehlerhof, Luisenhof and St. Georgenhof, are part of Ingenheim as well. 

History.
Village names with the ending “-heim“ in the Upper Rhine area are attributed to the time of <a href="Frankish%20colonisation">Frankish colonisation</a> (5th to 7th century). Ingenheim presumably derives from the personal name Ingo. Therefore, Ingenheim was settled by a person named Ingo.

The first documented mentions of the village name dates back to 1236 and 1238, when two <a href="Burgmann">Burgmannen</a> of <a href="Landeck%20Castle%20%28Palatinate%29">Landeck Castle</a>, a Konrad of Ingenheim and a Heinrich von Ingenheim, acted as witnesses to a gift of goods from the town of [Klingenmünster | [Münster]] to the <a href="Klingenm%C3%BCnster%20Abbey">Klingenmünster Abbey</a>. The knights of Ingenheim appear quite frequently in documents of this time up to the middle of the 15th century.

The village Ingenheim was originally a <a href="fief">fief</a> belonging to the Klingenmünster Abbey. As such, as a property of Castle Meistersel, half of the village was pawned by Otto von <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Ochsenstein">Ochsenstein</a> in 1369 to Konrad Landschad von Steinach. In 1395 Friedrich von Ochsenstein sold the other half to the <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Speyer">Bishopric of Speyer</a>. In the 16th century the village became the property of the barons of Gemmingen and remained in their possession up to the end of the 18th century. 

In 1792, after the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> (1789), the region became part of <a href="France">France</a>. Under French administration, Ingenheim belonged from 1794 onwards to the Canton of Landau, which was assigned to the <a href="Arrondissement%20of%20Wissembourg">Arrondissement of Wissembourg</a> in the <a href="Bas-Rhin">Bas-Rhin</a> department (department of the Lower Rhine). In 1804, 798 inhabitants boasted the village.

While the Canton of Landau, and therefore Ingenheim as well, was assigned to France during the first <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281814%29">Treaty of Paris (1814)</a>, this part of the department of the Lower Rhine located north of the river <a href="Lauter%20%28Rhine%29">Lauter</a> came under the sovereign territory of [Austrian Empire | [Austria]] with the second <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281815%29">Treaty of Paris (1815)</a>. The remaining areas of the Palatinate region, formerly belonging to the department of the <a href="Mont-Tonnerre">Mont-Tonnerre</a>, were given to Austria at the <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> in June 1815. With the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Munich%20%281816%29">Treaty of Munich</a> in April 1816, the entire <a href="Palatinate%20%28region%29">Palatinate region</a> was reassigned from the Austrian Empire to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Kingdom of Bavaria</a>. 

Under Bavarian administration, Ingenheim first remained in the Bavarian Canton of Landau. Due to territorial adjustments in 1817, Ingenheim was reclassified together with 5 additional municipalities to the Canton of Bergzabern, which was assigned to the County Commissariat Bergzabern (from 1862 known as District Administrative of Bergzabern). The municipality of Ingenheim had an autonomous administration. In 1819 and 1925, Daniel Bourquin was mayor of Ingenheim. 

During the 19th century, Ingenheim was the largest <a href="Qahal">Jewish community</a> in the Palatinate. In the 1830s, a total of 1,631 inhabitants were living in Ingenheim, of which 551 were <a href="Jews">Jewish</a>. The synagogue, which was destroyed in 1938, was built in 1831/1832. From 1869 to 1884, Ingenheim even had a Jewish mayor with Bernhard Roos (1796-1888).

According to 1928 official index of towns for the free state of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, a total of 1,315 inhabitants lived in 277 residential buildings in the rural community of Ingenheim.

531 inhabitants were Catholics, 687 were Protestants, 96 were Jews, and one was designated as "other“. The municipality covered 554 hectares. There was a Catholic and a Protestant parish, a Catholic, a Protestant, and a Jewish school as well as a post office. The train station “Ingenheim-Appenhofen“, on the route of the “Klingbachtalbahn“, was located in Ingenheim. The village mill with its six inhabitants belonged to the municipality as well.

In the course of the first territorial and administrative reform in Rhineland-Palatinate, the formerly autonomous municipality of Ingenheim, with at that time 1,436 inhabitants, was dissolved on June 7th 1969. Together with the municipalities of Appenhofen, Billigheim and Mühlhofen, the new municipality of <a href="Billigheim-Ingenheim">Billigheim-Ingenheim</a> was formed. At the same time, the district Bergzabern was dissolved and the municipality of Billigheim-Ingenheim was assigned to the new district Landau-Bad Bergzabern (renamed to <a href="S%C3%BCdliche%20Weinstra%C3%9Fe">Südliche Weinstraße</a> in 1977).

Transport.
Between 1892 and 1967, Ingenheim was connected to the railway network by the “Klingbachtalbahn“. The corresponding train station “Ingenheim-Appenhofen“ was located in Ingenheim. The nearest train station since then is Rohrbach.

Friends (Justin Bieber and BloodPop song)

"Friends" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter <a href="Justin%20Bieber">Justin Bieber</a> and American record producer and songwriter <a href="BloodPop">BloodPop</a>. It was written by Bieber, <a href="Julia%20Michaels">Julia Michaels</a>, <a href="Justin%20Tranter">Justin Tranter</a> and BloodPop, with production handled by Josh Gudwin and BloodPop. The song was released through GENPOP Corporation, <a href="RBMG%20Records">RBMG Records</a>, <a href="School%20Boy%20Records">School Boy Records</a>, <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> and <a href="Republic%20Records">Republic Records</a> on August 17, 2017. It is Bieber's first single credited as lead artist to be released in over a year, the previous being "<a href="Company%20%28Justin%20Bieber%20song%29">Company</a>", which was released in March 2016 for his studio album "<a href="Purpose%20%28Justin%20Bieber%20album%29">Purpose</a>" (2015).

Background.
In July, Bieber played fans a clip of the song at Milan Airport. On August 13, 2017, Bieber first teased the single by tweeting: "Can we still be friends". On August 14, 2017, Bieber announced an upcoming release on Twitter and Instagram, the accompanied artwork featured a monochrome illustration of two birds tearing apart a worm in front of highlighter yellow text, captioning: "New music. Thursday noon". Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter later revealed on social media that they co-wrote the single.

Critical reception.
Hugh McIntyre of "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" opined that "everything about the song is polished and perfectly suited to take over radio waves for the remainder of the summer". Spencer Kornhaber of "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" called the single "sleek electro" and "the zillionth child of the <a href="Eurythmics">Eurythmics</a>' "<a href="Sweet%20Dreams%20%28Are%20Made%20of%20This%29">Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)</a>" to approach the public in the past three decades". He wrote that BloodPop provided "an insistent beat", "a tight verse-prechorus-chorus structure" and "an on-trend wordless hook". Jordan Sargent of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" thinks that the four songwriters "seem to nod overtly at that song", and that the song "has the same little between-beat drum fills as '<a href="Sorry%20%28Justin%20Bieber%20song%29">Sorry</a>', as well as its pitched-up vocal counterpoints". Beth Shilliday of <a href="Hollywood%20Life">Hollywood Life</a> concluded: "It has all of [BloodPop's] incredible beats that flow between pop and EDM so flawlessly. Just add the Biebs' sexy voice and it's the recipe for a musical win!" Brittany Spanos of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" felt that Bieber "traded in the tropical house leanings of his previous solo hits for a more pop direction" with this song. Maeve McDermott of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" opined that the song "finally jailbreaks Bieber from the soulless trop-house prison of his other EDM one-offs". Nicholas Hautman of "<a href="Us%20Weekly">Us Weekly</a>" called the song an "EDM-inspired tune". Jordan Coley of <a href="The%20Ringer%20%28website%29">The Ringer</a> described the song as "189 seconds of vacuously standard Bieber fare". Shannon Carlin of "<a href="Bustle%20%28magazine%29">Bustle</a>" regarded the track as "a summer jam" and felt that "it was catchy as hell". Alicia Adejobi of "<a href="International%20Business%20Times">International Business Times</a>" thinks that the song "laced over an EDM beat". Phil Witmer of "<a href="Vice%20%28magazine%29">Vice</a>" wrote that the song "pretty much sounds like a synth-disco remix" of "Sorry", in which "the chord progression is the exact same". Beatrice Hazlehurst of "<a href="Paper%20%28magazine%29">Paper</a>" called the song "a shameless club banger".

Government of India v Taylor

Government of India v Taylor [1955] AC 491 (sometimes called Re Delhi Electric Supply & Traction Co Ltd) is a judicial decision of the <a href="Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> relating to the enforceability of foreign tax claims under <a href="English%20law">English law</a>.

Facts.
The Delhi Electric Supply & Traction Co Ltd was an English company which was formed in 1906. It was incorporated for the purpose of operating an electricity supply and tramway under an operating licence granted by the <a href="Municipal%20Corporation%20of%20Delhi">Municipality of Delhi</a>. The company carried on business in India until approximately 1947 when it sold the whole of its undertakings to the <a href="Government%20of%20India">Government of India</a> on 2 March 1947.

Samuel Taylor and John Lovering were appointed as <a href="liquidator%20%28law%29">liquidators</a>, having previously acted as <a href="board%20of%20directors">directors</a> of the company. On 24 October 1951 the Commissioner of Income Tax at Delhi served a notice claiming tax on the surplus from the sale of undertaking.

The liquidators rejected the claim, and sought directions from the court as to whether the claim was an admissible claim in the liquidation.

Decision.
The case came before <a href="Harry%20Vaisey">Vaisey J</a> at first instance who dismissed the claim. That decision was upheld by the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal</a> (<a href="Raymond%20Evershed%2C%201st%20Baron%20Evershed">Lord Evershed MR</a>, <a href="David%20Jenkins%2C%20Baron%20Jenkins">Jenkins LJ</a> and <a href="John%20Morris%2C%20Baron%20Morris%20of%20Borth-y-Gest">Morris LJ</a>). The Government of India then appealed to the <a href="Judicial%20functions%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>.

All five members of the House of Lords were unanimous that the claim must fail. Viscount Simonds gave the lead judgment. He commenced his speech by saying "My Lords, I will admit that I was greatly surprised to hear it suggested that the courts of this country would and should entertain a suit by a foreign State to recover a tax." He summarised the general prohibition at common law, citing various earlier cases on point, including "King of Hellenes v Broston" (1923) 16 Ll L Rep 190, "Re Visser" [1928] Ch 877 and "Sydney Municipal Council v Bull" [1909] 1 KB 7. Having cited the general rule, he then discussed the two alternative grounds upon which counsel for the Government of India was arguing that an exception should be made:

Viscount Simonds rejected both arguments, describing them as "frail weapons with which to attack a strong fortress". He noted that the general common law had tacit Parliamentary approval in the passing of the <a href="Foreign%20Judgments%20%28Reciprocal%20Enforcement%29%20Act%201933">Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933</a>, section 1(2)(b). He ultimately summarily rejected both arguments.

Lord Keith gave a short concurring judgment, specifically endorsing the recent judgment in "Peter Buchanan Ltd v McVey" [1954] Ir 89 (unreported at the time).

Lord Somervell also gave a short concurring speech, affirming the general statement of <a href="William%20Murray%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Mansfield">Lord Mansfield CJ</a> in "<a href="Holman%20v%20Johnson">Holman v Johnson</a>" (1775) 1 Cowp 341 at 343 that "no country ever takes notice of the revenue laws of another." He then went on to state that "after considerable research no case of any country could be found in which taxes due to State A had been enforced in the courts of State B."

Authority.
"Government of India v Taylor" remains good law today. It forms the central basis of Rule 3 of <a href="Dicey%20Morris%20%26amp%3B%20Collins">Dicey Morris & Collins</a> on "The Conflict of Laws", and is one of the primary authorities cited in support of that rule:

However it has been qualified by subsequent authorities. In "QRS 1 Aps v Frandsen" [1999] 1 WLR 2169 it was held that to uphold a contractual indemnity for the payment of taxes would not constitute indirect enforcement of a foreign tax claim.

It has also been noted that in practice the effect of the rule is widely circumvented by international treaties.

Silver Lamp Award

The award was the first acting award and possibly the first cultural award in Iceland.

The recipient was chosen by a vote based on total points for the year's performances, which led to some admired actors never achieving it. Three recipients won it twice: Valur Gíslason, and .

In 1972, as a single exception, instead of an actor the award went to , a photographer.

The 1973 Silver Lamp was to have been awarded to for his performance in supporting roles in productions including "<a href="Cabaret%20%28musical%29">Cabaret</a>", but he refused it, reading a prepared statement. The chairman of the association, Þorvarður Helgason, the drama critic for "<a href="Morgunbla%C3%B0i%C3%B0">Morgunblaðið</a>", announced in response that the award would no longer be given. The 1973 lamp was subsequently sold at auction.

German federal election, 2021

Federal elections to the 20th Bundestag will be held no later than 2021.

Date.
German law requires that a new Bundestag shall be elected on a Sunday or on a nationwide holiday between 46–48 months after the last Bundestag's first sitting. Since the 19th Bundestag will hold it's first sitting no later than 24 October 2017, the last possible date for the election to the 20th Bundestag will be 24 October 2021.

The exact date will be determined by the <a href="President%20of%20Germany">President of Germany</a>.

Elections can be held earlier, if the <a href="President%20of%20Germany">President</a> dissolves the Bundestag. He may only do so, if the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor</a> has lost a <a href="confidence%20motion">confidence motion</a> and requested the dissolution. In this case, a new Bundestag has to be elected on a Sunday or a holiday within 60 days after the dissolution.

Electoral system.
The German electoral system, which could be described as a system of <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> combined with elements of <a href="first-past-the-post%20voting">first-past-the-post voting</a>, is by comparison quite complicated. The following explanation is very much simplified.

Every elector has two votes, the "first-vote" and the "second-vote". The Bundestag has 598 nominal members, elected for a four-year term; these seats are distributed between the states in proportion to the states population elegible to vote.

299 members are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting. Here, only the "first-votes" count. The "second-votes" serve, to determine the proportional representation of the parties in the Bundestag (and are therefore far more important than the "first-votes", despite the misleading name).

If a party by winning single-member constituencies in one state earns more seats than it would be entitled to according to its "second-vote"-share in that state (so called "overhang seats"), the other parties receive "compensation seats". Because of that, the Bundestag usually has more than 598 members. If a party wins less constituency-seats in a state than it would be entitled to, it receives additional seats from the relevant state-list. Parties can file lists in each single state under certain conditions, for example a fixed number of supporting signatures. Parties can receive "second-votes" only in those states, in which they have successfully filed a state-list.

But in order to qualify for seats in the Bundestag corresponding to "second-vote"-share at all, a party must "either" win three single-member constituencies "or" exceed a <a href="electoral%20threshold">threshold</a> of 5% of the "second-votes" "nationwide".

If a party only wins one or two single-member constituencies and fails, to get at least 5% of the "second-votes", it keeps these seat(s), but the other parties, who accomplished one of the two mentioned conditions, receive "compensation seats" (this last time happened in <a href="German%20federal%20election%2C%202002">2002</a>). The same applies, if an independent candidate wins a single-member constituency (which rarely happens).

If a voter has cast a "first-vote" for a "successfull" independent candidate or a "successfull" candidate, whose party failed to qualify for proportional representation, his or her "second-vote" does not count to determine proportional representation. However it does count to determine, whether the elected party has exceeded the 5% threshold.

Parties representing recognized national minorities (currently Danes, Frisians, Sorbs and Romani people) are exempt from the 5% threshold, but normally only run in state elections.

Seats are allocated using the <a href="Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB%20method">Sainte-Laguë method</a>.

<doc id="54897841" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54897841" title="Cladophialophora carrionii">
Cladophialophora carrionii

Cladophialophora carrionii is a <a href="melanin">melanized</a> fungus in the genus "Cladophialophora" that is associated with decaying plant material like cacti and wood. It is one of the most frequent species of "Cladophialophora" implicated in human disease. "Cladophialophora carrionii" is a causative agent of <a href="chromoblastomycosis">chromoblastomycosis</a>, a <a href="Subcutaneous%20tissue">subcutaneous</a> infection that occurs in sub-tropical areas such as Madagascar, Australia and northwestern Venezuela. Transmission occurs through traumatic implantation of plant material colonized by "C. carrionii", mainly infecting rural workers. When "C. carrionii" infects its host, it transforms from a <a href="Mycelium">mycelial</a> state to a muriform state to better tolerate the extreme conditions in the host's body.

Habitat and ecology.
Infections by "C. carrionii" typically arise following traumatic inoculation of material colonized by the fungus. Most infections are reported from dry rural agricultural areas regions. "Cladophialophora carrionii" is <a href="saprotrophic%20nutrition">saprotrophic</a>, occurring mainly on decaying plant material such as wood where it produces enzymes that allow it to utilize lignin as a nutrient source. "Cladophialophora carrionii" is also found in <a href="pine">pine</a> trees, <a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> fence posts (which are often used in farming to protect crops), soil and dead cactus spines where it derives its nutrition from carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins in the plant tissue.

Morphology.
"Cladophialophora carrionii" is part of a group of melanized fungi, also known as “black yeasts” because its mycelial form has a dark green colour and its <a href="Conidium">conidia</a> have brown pigment. Colonies grow at a modest rate on <a href="Sabouraud%20agar">Sabouraud dextrose agar</a>. The conidia of "C. carrionii" are unicellular oval-shaped <a href="spore">spore</a>s that are distinguishable due to the presence of two lightly pigmented scars. Conidia vary in length (1.5-3.0 × 2.0-7.5 µm). Its long conidiophores are similar to the genus "<a href="Cladosporium">Cladosporium</a>", which comes from the Latin word "clado", meaning branched. The genus "Cladophialophora" is distinguished from "Cladosporium" because in addition to chains of conidia, members of the genus "Cladophialophora" also produce <a href="phialide">phialide</a>s. "Cladophialophora carrionii" is a <a href="Dimorphic%20fungus">dimorphic</a> <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> that changes states from a mycelial form to a muriform, yeast-like state once it invades its host. Muriform cells are golden-brown in colour due to melanin deposition and have thick cell walls.

Growth and reproduction.
Like many other black yeasts, "C. carrionii" is sensitive to temperatures above 37 °C. It can be distinguished in culture by the presence of its <a href="urease">urease</a> enzyme hydrolyzing <a href="urea">urea</a> and its inability to liquefy <a href="gelatin">gelatin</a>. Altering temperatures or micronutrient levels such as calcium and phosphate affects whether "C. carrionii" is in the mycelial or muriform state. The fungus transforms to muriform cells under conditions of temperature between 25 °C to 37 °C, 0.1 mM Ca, and a pH of 2.5. It produces multiple conidia in long, straight chains that bud off the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e, with the youngest conidia farthest from the hyphae. There is no sexual state known for "C. carrionii".

Disease in humans.
"Cladophialophora carrionii" can cause a disease called chromoblastomycosis in individuals with a normal functioning immune system, unlike many other pathogenic fungi that can only cause disease in <a href="Immunodeficiency">immunocompromised</a> individuals. It is one of the most common agents of chromoblastomycosis. The fungus changes states once it invades the animal host from the mycelial state to muriform cells that spread outward radially. This dimorphism has been suggested to increase the tolerance of "C. carrionii" to extreme conditions, such as the high temperature and acidity in the human body. Muriform cells increase cell number by <a href="septum">septum</a> formation within the hyphae, rather than by <a href="budding">budding</a>.

Chromoblastomycosis results in subcutaneous, crusty lesions that can spread over large areas on different parts of the body such as the legs, arms and face. If not treated, the lesions continue to increase in size over the body, but do not usually pose a risk of mortality. As the lesions grow, they can take on multiple forms that resemble nodes, tumours (resemble cauliflowers), and plaques. Infection causes <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> of the leg or foot tissue, resulting in <a href="granuloma">granuloma</a>s.

Epidemiology.
Chromoblastomycosis is found worldwide, most prominently in tropical and sub-tropical regions such as Mexico, Madagascar, Brazil, China, and Malaysia but some cases have been reported in the United States and Europe. "Cladophialophora carrionii" causes only a minor subset of chromoblastomycosis cases, most notably in drier locations such as Madagascar, Australia and northwestern Venezuela, which are rife with plants inhabited by the fungus. Many cases of chromoblastomycosis cases target males over the age of thirty because they are predominant in the agricultural industry in rural areas, where deforestation must be carried out to provide agricultural land and they directly work with the plants that are commonly colonized by "C. carrionii".

Pathogenesis and treatment.
Chromoblastomycosis infection occurs by subcutaneous puncture by a thorn or splinter that is infected with "C. carrionii", such as decaying cacti and wood. Scratching at the lesions worsens the infection by spreading the fungus over larger and <a href="distal">distal</a> areas of the body. Field workers who work without foot protection or clothing covering legs and arms are at greater risk for inoculation by material colonized by "C. carrionii". Immunocompromised individuals are also at risk, because the ability to produce <a href="Antibody">antibodies</a> against fungal proteins is critical in minimizing fungal pathogenicity and "C. carrionii" may penetrate deeper into muscle and bone layers if the patient is immunosuppressed. Even if an individual is <a href="Immunocompetence">immunocompetent</a>, they may be at risk if they carry the HLA-A29 <a href="antigen">antigen</a>, since its presence may increase an individual’s susceptibility to contracting chromoblastomycosis. <a href="Histology">Histology</a> tests from a skin biopsy can identify muriform cells that are commonly found in chromoblastomycosis. Identifying the specific agent that caused chromoblastomycosis can be done by <a href="Polymerase%20chain%20reaction">PCR</a> assays or culturing the fungus by growing it on an agar plate and observing the colony <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> and <a href="Spore">sporulation</a> characteristics. However, "C. carrionii" grows quite slowly in culture, so significant results cannot be obtained until after 4–6 weeks of <a href="Incubator%20%28culture%29">incubation</a>.

During infection, the immune system of the host attempts to eliminate the fungus via engulfment and degradation by <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s and <a href="neutrophil">neutrophil</a>s, which function in the <a href="innate%20immune%20system">innate immune system</a>. The <a href="adaptive%20immune%20system">adaptive immune system</a> also plays a role by activating cells such as <a href="interleukin-6">interleukin-6</a> (IL-6), the type of IL specifically produced with "C. carrionii" infection, but it may have negative consequences for eradicating the fungus. It is postulated that the presence of melanin in black yeasts like "C. carrionii" contributes to pathogenicity because it strengthens the fungal <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> and can neutralize the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s produced in macrophages that normally function to break down targeted cells.

Minor cases of chromoblastomycosis can be resolved by <a href="surgery">surgery</a> or <a href="antifungal">antifungal</a> medications. Cold therapy (<a href="cryosurgery">cryosurgery</a>) by applying cool <a href="liquid%20nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a> onto lesions can be effective if combined with antifungal therapy and <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>. More serious cases must be treated for a prolonged period of time (6 to 12 months) with the antifungals <a href="itraconazole">itraconazole</a> and <a href="terbinafine">terbinafine</a>. Antifungals have a wide range of effectiveness, curing between 15-80% of cases. However, "C. carrionii" is sensitive to commonly used antifungals so cure rates are higher than seen in chromoblastomycosis infections caused by "<a href="Fonsecaea%20pedrosoi">Fonsecaea pedrosoi</a>". Treatments less effective if the infection is chronic, resulting in high relapse rates.

Among these entities, since 1937 Metalosport appeared, the first metallurgical group whose presence on the divisional stage is registered in the <a href="Liga%20III">Divizia C</a> championship, in the Seria II of the South League, in the competitive year 1937-38 (5th place at the end of the championship).
The third league - <a href="Liga%20III">Divizia C</a> - was organized for the first time 73 years ago (1936). It was an autumn-spring edition. The 52 participants were divided into five series - according to geographic criteria: north, south, west, center and east.

In 2000, the team was disbanded, eleven years later, a new administrative team refounded FC Metalosport Galaţi. The initiative belonged to his former player, Dorin Butunoiu, helped by a group of people, including Iulian Aramă, Marius Vasilache, Marian Ursu, Andu Nicolau and Radu Iorgu.
The team evolved from 2011 in the 5th and 4th Division and promoted to the <a href="Liga%20III">Liga III</a> at the end of the 2013–14 season, after a play-off match against FC Gârceni.

The Railroad Adventures of Chen Sing

The Railroad Adventures of Chen Sing is a chapter book for young readers written by <a href="George%20Chiang">George Chiang</a> and illustrated by Jessica Warner. The book was published in <a href="hardcover">hardcover</a>, <a href="paperback">paperback</a> and <a href="ebook">ebook</a> on March 1, 2017 and won two 2017 Global Ebook Awards for best "Children's Literature Fiction" and "Juvenile Fiction"

Origins.
The book is a work of historical fiction inspired by stories that Isaac (Ike) Sing told to Chiang in the late 1990s. Chiang made two trips, totalling a period of three weeks, to Sing's home in <a href="Cawston%2C%20British%20Columbia">Cawston, British Columbia</a> and recorded many hours of interviews about his own life and the life of his father, Chen Sing. From these recordings Chiang put together the life story of Chen Sing and used it to write the book. The real Chen Sing was born in 1860 and was orphaned at a young age.
He lived an impoverished existence in Yin Ping, <a href="Guangdong">Guangdong</a> with his elder brother and sister until his teenage years when he left to go to the city of <a href="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, <a href="China">China</a> to find work. Once there he found out about an opportunity to help build a railway in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. The book follows his journey from his home village to the end of his railroad building days.

Plot.
"While the book is a work of historical fiction, it is based on the life of a real Chen Sing, an orphan who emigrated from southern China in the wake of floods and famine. In the book, he is small but strong and is able to survive the arduous two-month sea voyage and succeed at various jobs with the railway crew that others can not handle because of his determination and intelligence. He is also helped by his friendship with members of the <a href="Coast%20Salish">Coast Salish</a> people, who help him acclimate to the surprisingly cold winter. One particularly delightful chapter extols the simple joys of ice fishing, snowshoeing, snowball fights, and other winter pastimes that Chen Sing enjoys for the first time with a new friend."

David Gamble (photographer)

David Martin Gamble is a British-American photographer and artist known for his portrait and journalistic photography.

Six of his portraits, including one of <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>, are held by the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Portrait Gallery</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="England">England</a>. A portrait of <a href="Neil%20deGrasse%20Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> by Gamble is held in the collections of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian</a>’s <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%20%28United%20States%29">National Portrait Gallery</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>

Early life and education.
Gamble was born in March 1953. In his youth, he was a member of a number of bands in the Cambridge rock scene in the 1970s, including the Inserts, Truth and Rory. He graduated from <a href="Ealing%20Art%20College">Ealing School of Art</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="England">England</a>. After which, he did his postgraduate studies at the <a href="Association%20of%20Photographers">Association of Photographers</a>. In 1986, Gamble was an assistant to <a href="Neal%20Slavin">Neal Slavin</a> during the publication of Slavin’s book of photography "Britons". For a short period later in 1992, he would serve as a director of the association.

Career.
Soon after the death of <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, Gamble was permitted access to the artist’s <a href="66th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">East 66th Street, Manhattan</a> apartment to photograph his art work, furniture and myriad of personal effects. The project was commissioned by <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby’s</a> as part of the publicity for their auction of Warhol’s property. A decade later in January 1998, Gamble exhibited a collection of the photographs, taken over a period of eight days, at the <a href="Groucho%20Club">Groucho Club</a> in London. Images of Warhol were digitally superimposed on several of the photographs, creating the feeling that to <a href="Paul%20Vallely">Paul Vallely</a> of <a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a> seemed as though “the dead man [haunted] the photographs of his living spaces.”

A notable example in this collection of photographs is a look inside Warhol’s medicine cabinet in his private bathroom containing his varies prescription medication and personal hygiene products. This collection of prints has toured several locations, being exhibited at several galleries in the United States. The photograph of his medicine cabinet was also included in "Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years", an exhibit by <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> that was also presented at <a href="The%20Andy%20Warhol%20Museum">The Andy Warhol Museum</a>.

In 1987, Gamble was awarded the inaugural Kodak European Awards which is given to professional photographers under 35-years-old.

In 1988, Gamble photographed <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> in a portrait commissioned by <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time Magazine"</a>. The photograph was the winner of the second prize in the Science & Technology category of the <a href="World%20Press%20Photo%20of%20the%20Year">World Press Photo of the Year</a> award. A copy of the Hawking photograph is currently held in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London, England. Other portraits held by the gallery include those of <a href="Quentin%20Crisp">Quentin Crisp</a>, <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a>, <a href="Will%20Self">Will Self</a>, <a href="Alan%20Sugar">Alan Sugar</a> and <a href="Elisabeth%20Welch">Elisabeth Welch</a>. As a photojournalist, Gamble has worked for <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">"Life"</a>", <a href="The%20Observer">Observer</a>", <a href="The%20New%20Yorker">"The New Yorker"</a>, and "Time" magazines. His photographs of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> were also included in and were on the cover of the Observer Magazine’s “Irish Issue” of 30 October 1988.

In 2000, Gamble published a photo-book with Will Self entitled Perfidious Man. The book includes several photographs by Gamble accompanied by essays written by Self. The main subject of the photographs and essays is a look into the contemporary concept of masculinity.

Gamble moved to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> in 2000, establishing his residence in <a href="The%20Hamptons">The Hamptons</a>. Paintings he created during this period were later exhibited at the New Century Artists Gallery in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>.

Gamble and Eric Ernst formed the Artists Secret Society. The society attempts to circumvent the traditional galleries in the Hamptons area. ASS opened an exhibit in July 2008 to promote “successful and lesser known” artists in the area. Ernst and Gamble also host an interview segment on Plum TV’s “Morning Noon and Night” show. In 2009, some of Gamble’s work was added to the collections of the <a href="Guild%20Hall%20Museum">Guild Hall Museum</a> in <a href="East%20Hampton%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">East Hampton, New York</a>. At the museums “ac.qui.si.tions” exhibit in November 2009, Gamble was on-hand to present and discuss his work with visitors.

According to <a href="Neil%20deGrasse%20Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>, Gamble and <a href="Helen%20Matsos">Helen Matsos</a> were the other two co-creators of the scientific talk show <a href="StarTalk%20%282015%20TV%20series%29">StarTalk</a>. A portrait of Tyson taken by Gamble in 2010 is held the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>

Gamble recently collaborated with the <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> choreographer Maya Taylor on a work named “The Silence Project”.

The problem of the speckled hen

In the theory of <a href="empirical%20knowledge">empirical knowledge</a>, the problem of the speckled hen is whether a single immediate <a href="observation">observation</a> of a <a href="wikt%3Aspeckle">speckle</a>d <a href="chicken">hen</a> provides a certain knowledge of the number of speckles observed. Clearly, this is not an isolated example, and the therefore it is of fundamental nature. Philosophically, this problem probes the limits of <a href="Knowledge%20by%20acquaintance">Knowledge by acquaintance</a>: the existence of determinate things in one's experience one is unable to know with <a href="certainty">certainty</a> merely by the virtue of the experience.

<a href="Roderick%20Chisholm">Roderick Chisholm</a> attributes it to <a href="Gilbert%20Ryle">Gilbert Ryle</a> suggesting to <a href="A.%20J.%20Ayer">A. J. Ayer</a>. It is viewed as a critisicm of the view expressed by <a href="C.%20I.%20Lewis">C. I. Lewis</a> that there can never be "positive bafflement in the presence of the immediate, because there is here no question which fails to find an answer".

<a href="Joseph%20Heath">Joseph Heath</a> remarks that this problem is one of the "descendants of <a href="Rene%20Descartes">Descartes</a>'s '<a href="chiliagon">chiliagon</a>' argument in the sixth of his "<a href="Meditations%20on%20First%20Philosophy">Meditations</a>"". 

A. J. Ayer suggested that if we are unable to enumerate speckles accurately, then it incorrect to suggest that the "sense-data" provides a definite number of speckles despite the fact that the hen does have a definite number of them, clearly outlined. In Ayers' words, speckles are enumerable only if in fact the have been enumerated. 

A number of philosophers analyzed the merits of this proposition. Chisholm concludes that the problem of the speckled hen emphacises the fact that there are basic propositions (<a href="synthetic%20proposition">synthetic proposition</a>s which do not refer beyond the content of the immediate experience) are necessarily imprecise.

Glory Academy, Kamakura

Glory Academy, Kamakura, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, is an all-boys, junior and senior high school, founded in 1947 by the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> in the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. It has as its patron the <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> St. <a href="Aloysius%20Gonzaga">Aloysius Gonzaga</a> and takes as its motto that of the Jesuits: <a href="Ad%20maiorem%20Dei%20gloriam">"For the greater glory of God</a>." The name of the school given here is a rendering of the Japanese name "Eiko Gakuen."

History.
The Jesuits, founded by <a href="Ignatius%20of%20Loyola">Ignatius of Loyola</a> in 1540, came to Japan in the 16th century and founded a school in Arima, during the <a href="Azuchi%E2%80%93Momoyama%20period">Azuchi period</a>, which was closed after the banishment of the Jesuits. They returned to Japan and established <a href="Sophia%20University">Sophia University</a> in Tokyo in 1913, <a href="Sophia%20Fukuoka%20Junior%20and%20Senior%20High%20School">Taisei/Sophia Fukuoka Junior and Senior High School</a> in 1932, <a href="Rokko%20Junior%20and%20Senior%20High%20School">Rokko Junior and Senior High School</a> in <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a> in 1937, Glory Academy Middle School in 1947 in <a href="Taura%20Station">Taura</a>, <a href="Kanagawa%20Prefecture">Kanagawa Prefecture</a>, and later <a href="Hiroshima%20Academy%20Junior%20and%20Senior%20High%20School">Hiroshima Academy Junior and Senior High School</a> in 1956. 

In 1950 education at Glory was extended through high school. By 1953 there were 473 in the junior high school and 273 in the high school. In 1957 Glory became independent of the Sophia University Foundation. In 1964 the school moved from Taura to its present, 27.4 acre site at Oboe, <a href="Kamakura">Kamakura</a>, <a href="Kanagawa%20Prefecture">Kanagawa Prefecture</a>. The <a href="Germany">German</a> Jesuit Professor from Sophia University Gustav Foss was the founding principal and remained in the job for 30 years. 

Art and technology classrooms were completed in 1992. On the 50th anniversary in 1997, a new gymnasium and baseball stadium were added. 

In April 2016 four Jesuit academies joined into a new corporation, called the Sophia College Corporation, to consolidate their efforts and strengthen their Jesuit identity, as through common teacher training. The corporation is centered at Sophia University, which lends its assistance to the schools. In this way, with the declining number of Jesuits, the Jesuit influence is more likely to endure. These schools are <a href="Hiroshima%20Academy%20Junior%20and%20Senior%20High%20School">Hiroshima Academy</a>, <a href="Rokko%20Junior%20and%20Senior%20High%20School">Rokko School</a>, <a href="Sophia%20Fukuoka%20Junior%20and%20Senior%20High%20School">Sophia Academy</a>, and Glory Academy, along with <a href="Elisabeth%20University%20of%20Music">Elisabeth University of Music</a>.

Education.
In the Jesuit tradition, the school endeavors to train "men for others." There is heavy emphasis on learning and discipline. Ethics class is compulsory but religious and biblical studies are optional. Considerable emphasis is placed on English language studies.

The school is one of the most demanding in Kanagawa prefecture and all of Japan. More than 3,000 out of 10,000 graduates have attended the <a href="University%20of%20Tokyo">University of Tokyo</a>, an <a href="Imperial%20Universities">Imperial University</a>. From 2008 to 2013, of 1076 graduates 350 attended the University of Tokyo and 98 its medical school. Also, 63 went on to <a href="Hitotsubashi%20University">Hitotsubashi University</a>, 39 to <a href="Tokyo%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Tokyo Institute of Technology</a>, 107 to other public universities, and 387 to private universities.

International experiences are offered on a regular basis with <a href="Sacred%20Heart%20School%20%E2%80%93%20Ateneo%20de%20Cebu">Sacred Heart School – Ateneo de Cebu</a> in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and with <a href="Boston%20College">Boston College</a> in the United States. 

Extracurricular activities.
All junior high school students are required to participate in some club activities. The high school <a href="Association%20football">soccer team</a> has twice made it to the national high school championship. representing Kanagawa prefecture. The baseball team represented the South Kanto region in the national high school softball championships in 2003. The gymnastics department won the <a href="Double%20Dutch%20%28jump%20rope%29">Double Dutch (jump rope)</a> world tournament in 2014. 

Extracurricular activities in which students excel include the International Science Olympic Games (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology). The school won the 2015 nationwide high school debate tournament (in English) and participated in the world competition. In 2003, students won the national high school quiz championship. Student activities include a brass band. 

Masses and other religious activities are offered throughout the year. Voluntary service programs carry students to a rehabilitation hospital and a children's home. 

School events.
These include an annual "walking competition" (30 km) on the coastal road in early November, a cultural "Glory Festival" in early May, and a sports festival in late September.

Model UN World Congress in New York

From May 15 to 21, 2012, Glory Academy was one of two Japanese high schools to participate in the <a href="Model%20United%20Nations">Model United Nations</a> at its headquarters in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, qualifying through its performance at the Japan tournament in November 2011, The school represented <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> in New York and proposed that the <a href="Imf">IMF</a> cancel the external debt of developing countries. A Glory Academy group received honorable mention for its position paper.

<doc id="54898326" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54898326" title="Cladosporium sphaerospermum">
Cladosporium sphaerospermum

Cladosporium sphaerospermum is a fungus belonging to the genus "<a href="Cladosporium">Cladosporium</a>" and was described in 1886 by <a href="Albert%20Julius%20Otto%20Penzig">Albert Julius Otto Penzig</a> from the decaying leaves and branches of "<a href="Citrus">Citrus</a>". It is a dematiaceous (darkly-pigmented) <a href="fungus">fungus</a> characterized by slow growth and largely asexual reproduction. "Cladosporium sphaerospermum" consists of a complex of poorly <a href="Morphology">morphologically</a> differentiated, "cryptic" species that share many physiological and <a href="Ecology">ecological</a> attributes. In older literature, all of these sibling species were classified as "C. sphaerospermum" despite their unique nature. Accordingly, there is confusion in older literature reports on the physiological and habitat regularities of "C. sphaerospermum" in the strict sense. This fungus is most <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetically</a> similar to "<a href="Cladosporium%20fusiforme">C. fusiforme</a>". According to modern phylogenetic analyses, the previously synonymized species, "Cladosporium langeroni", is a distinct species.

Growth and morphology.
The <a href="Hypha">hyphae</a> of "Cladosporium sphaerospermum" are thick walled, <a href="septate">septate</a>, and olivaceous-brown in colour. Colonies of the fungus are velvety in texture and flattened (i.e., rarely raised, fluffy, or radially furrowed). "C. sphaerospermum" <a href="Conidium">conidiophores</a> are branched, septate, and dark, up to 150–300 μm long and 3.5–4.0 μm wide. The structure of the conidiophores are tree-like, a prominent feature of the genus "Cladosporium". Unlike other related species, the conidiophores of this species lack swollen nodes at the branching points. Conidia of this species are characteristically globose to ellipsoid with a diameter of 3.4–4.0 μm. The conidia are formed in branching chains in which the youngest conidium is situated at the top. "Cladosporium sphaerospermum" also produces ramoconidia 6–14 × 3.5–4.0 μm in length and this feature can be used as a method of distinguishing between similar species. Ramoconidia are conidia found at the branching points joining multiple spore chains and can be recognized by one end having a single attachment scar and the other end having two or more attachment scars. "Cladosporium sphaerospermum" is also a <a href="psychrophilic">psychrophilic</a> fungus, known to grow at temperatures as low as –5 °C with an upper limit of and no growth at . The optimal temperature this fungus grows under is . This fungus is <a href="Xerophile">xerotolerant</a> as it can thrive in environments with low water activity caused by high salinity (<a href="halotolerant">halotolerant</a>) or other dissolved solutes. This fungus has been observed to grow in as low as 0.815 a "in vitro".

Physiology.
"Cladosporium sphaerospermum" is considered a <a href="saprotroph">saprotroph</a> and is a secondary invader of dead or dying plant tissue. Energy is provided through the conversion of starch, <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, and <a href="sucrose">sucrose</a> to <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a> and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. However, it has been shown in a laboratory environment that these fungi are able to successfully grow with <a href="toluene">toluene</a> as the sole source of carbon. This trait may have arisen because these fungi and many others from the genus "Cladosporium" are secondary colonizers and frequently dwell in environments poor in nutrients. "Cladosporium sphaerospermum" is able to enhance polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation in soils due to reactive oxygen species produced as secondary <a href="Metabolite">metabolites</a>, such as <a href="Hydrogen%20peroxide">HO</a>. This species is a prolific producer of the pigmented secondary metabolite, <a href="melanin">melanin</a>, thought to serve as a protective mechanism against <a href="Ultraviolet">UV irradiation</a>, enzymatic lysis, oxidant attack, and fungal infections from other competing fungi. A method that can be used to determine the presence of this fungus on a background of other organic material is through the <a href="KOH%20test">KOH test</a> which stains the fungus. The addition of lactophenol blue with this test turns the <a href="chitin">chitin</a> in the cell wall blue but leaves the budding <a href="Conidium">conidia</a> and globular <a href="Conidium">conidiophore</a>s with their characteristic brown colouring. The first draft sequence of the "C. sphaerospermum" <a href="genome">genome</a> was created in 2012. Genes were identified that are involved in the <a href="1%2C5-Dihydroxynaphthalene">dihydroxynaphthalene</a> (DHN)-<a href="melanin">melanin</a> biosynthesis pathway which confirms the <a href="etiology">etiology</a> of melanin in this species. Genes associated with the production of allergens were also identified as well as those conferring resistance to various antifungal drugs.

Habitat and ecology.
"Cladosporium sphaerospermum" is a cosmopolitan fungus that inhabits city buildings and the environment and because of its airborne nature it can move rapidly between locations, though the extent of this is lacking in research. It is found in hypersaline environments in <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean</a> and tropical climates, as well as soil and plant environments in temperate climates. The indoor presence of this fungus can signify there is a <a href="condensation">condensation</a> problem within the building such as on bathroom walls and in kitchens. "Cladosporium sphaerospermum" is also been shown to inhabit paint films on walls and other surfaces as well as old paintings. This fungus is also able to grow on gypsum-based material with and without paint and wallpaper. Plant materials that are affected include citrus leaves on various other decaying plant leaves, on the stems of herbaceous and woody plants, on fruits and vegetables. The fungus has also been reported from wheat-based bakery items. 

Human health.
"Cladosporium sphaerospermum" is mainly known as a <a href="Decomposition">spoilage</a> agent of harvested fruits and vegetables. There are very few reports implicating this species as a disease agent in humans. It is known as an allergen and mainly causes problems in patients with respiratory tract diseases as well as subcutaneous <a href="phaeohyphomycosis">phaeohyphomycosis</a> and intrabronchial lesions in <a href="Immunocompetence">immunocompetent</a> individuals caused by many dematiaceous fungi. It has been reported rarely from skin, eye, sinus, and brain infections.

Style and process.
Robinson's work has been described by Titus Levi as a musical rendering of <a href="abstract%20expressionism">abstract expressionism</a>. In <a href="Keyboard%20Magazine">Keyboard Magazine</a> he explains in his 1991 Discoveries article featuring Robinson: "Robinson’s sense of timing, phrasing, form, and flow guide listeners toward his alternative vision. His music has the clarity and ingenuousness of <a href="Chinese%20painting">Chinese brush painting</a>, some of the hard geometric edginess of <a href="Kandinsky">Kandinsky</a>, and a detached, ethereal, and abstract quality that nonetheless seems bound to the tight forms found in some <a href="Abstract%20expressionism">abstract Expressionist</a> paintings."

Christina V. Godbey of "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">The Los Angeles Times</a>" (May 30, 1992) wrote of Robinson’s process: “Michael Robinson is a composer of the modern age...Since 1985, he has written compositions exclusively for the computer, and it has produced some rather unusual sounds. Robinson composes music with traditional notations on paper before it is translated and encoded into the computer.”

Robinson has composed over 400 works and has released over 100 albums. His musical style is informed by American, South Asian, and European traditions. "...his production methodology is also unique: although the performance of a typical Robinson piece sounds as if spontaneous improvisation is involved, his compositions are, amazingly, entirely programmed using the Meruvina and thus fully notated.”

NGC 4340 is generally thought to be paired up with the galaxy <a href="NGC%204350">NGC 4350</a>.

Physical characteristics.
NGC 4340 has a small inner bar embedded in a luminous stellar nuclear ring. Even though the ring is luminous, there are no star-forming regions. Instead, the ring is made of mostly old stars in a gas-poor environment. The color of the ring is the same as the color as the surrounding bulge suggesting that it is probably an old, “fossil” remnant of an earlier episode of star-formation. Crossing the inner ring, there is a larger primary bar with <a href="ansae">ansae</a> at the ends. Careful inspection shows that the two bars are slightly misaligned, which suggests they may be independently rotating. The larger primary bar connects to another ring that surrounds the central regions of the galaxy.

Saussurian dichotomies

Saussurean or Saussurian is just a term used to refer to De Suassure's followers (that) collect their senior lectures into a book which was and still a revolutionary one to the academic linguists and philosophers .That book published in 1916 and is entitled as "Course In General Linguistics". It was such a major work which makes him a well-known figure to Indo-European comparative linguistics.

However, Saussure in his influential book,"Course in general linguistics" (1916)
states that there are certain dichotomies related to theories of meaning, and they are:(1)Diachronic:stresses and studies the change in languages over time, such as the change in between old and modern Einglish in phontics, syntax, and semantics.It is also called diachronic linguistics.(2)Sychronic:allows merely one perspective which is of language user, i.e. it is a non historical study.(3)Lange:a French term refers to the language system which is shared by a community of speakers .(4)Parole:a concrete act of speaking in actual situations by an individual.Lange &Parole, in what way resemble Chomsky"s competence and performance .(5)Syntagmatic:the combination of elements horizontally.(6)Paradigmatic: the association of elements vertically.(7)Signifier :concept or sound image.(8)Signified:entity.

If one now compares between Suassure and Peirce who is considered as a vital one in the history of semiotics, one will find that Saussure stresses the use of semiology,while Peirce with semiotics.Also, Saussure used two sides theory:signifier &signified,where as Peirce used three:sign,object &interpretant.

The Concerto for six instrumental formations and two solo instruments (<a href="vibraphone">vibraphone</a> and <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>) is a work composed by <a href="Jean%20Barraqu%C3%A9">Jean Barraqué</a> in 1962–68.

History.
The initial impulse to write the Concerto came when <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a> wrote to Barraqué asking for a new work for the <a href="Domaine%20Musical">Domaine Musical</a>’s 1962–63 season. Barraqué wrote back, suggesting the Concerto, and he began composing it on Easter Monday, 23 April 1962. He did not finish it at that time, however. He resumed work in the summer of 1968 in <a href="Perros-Guirec">Perros-Guirec</a>, and completed the score in Florence on 22 October of the same year. It was premiered on 20 November 1968 at the <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a> in London, by <a href="Hubert%20Rostaing">Hubert Rostaing</a> (clarinet), <a href="Tristan%20Fry">Tristan Fry</a> (vibraphone), and the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> conducted by <a href="Gilbert%20Amy">Gilbert Amy</a>. The manuscript score was dedicated on 20 March 1969 to Claude and Hubert Rostaing (; ; ).

Instrumentation.
There are two solo instruments, clarinet and vibraphone, accompanied by six instrumental formations, each containing one stringed instrument, one woodwind, and one brass :

Character.
The manuscript title page includes several mottos and inscriptions indicating the formal character and intended poetic atmosphere. One of these is an abbreviated form of the “Affranchi du hasard” quotation found in the printed score of ‘’… au delà du hasard’’: “the many currents cross / … towards one convergent point / united among themselves they are the mirrors”. One of the others indicate <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a> as a spiritual influence: “because of a smile, for a sadness, for a very gentle memory towards Schubert” .

Structure.
The Concerto consists of seventeen sequences grouped in six sections, which are played without interruption . Its scoring resembles that of Pierre Boulez’s "Domaines", which was begun in 1961 and premiered in the same year as the Concerto, but while Boulez keeps his six instrumental groups as distinct as possible, Barraqué’s flow together into an orchestra. Boulez also projects a regular series of twelve alternations between his soloiist and each instrumental group, whereas Barraqué’s work is continuous .

Stop Masturbating Start Living

Intro.
Stop Masturbating and Start Living (SMSL) is a book written by Joseph Fan and designed to help the reader lead a more powerful and fulfilling life. Written in a fun and easy to read format, SMSL aims to help the reader improve his or her health, wealth, love, and happiness, keeping in mind the tagline “How to go from fappy to happy.” It can also be said that Stop Masturbating and Start Living is a book on how to stop masturbating and start living. However, masturbation is also a metaphor for any vice.

Synopsis.
SMSL is cleverly written so that it takes the average reader 13 minutes to read, the average amount of time it takes one to masturbate. Each chapter short and to the point, SMSL begins with a foreword that squashes the taboo of masturbation as an uncomfortable topic right out of the gate. The foreword explains that masturbation “is a serious subject, a serious addiction for some, that you may be dealing with hands-on.” As the author then continues to explain and as this quote exemplifies, SMSL is full of puns, light hearted, and written so that the reader is not afraid of a taboo topic. Following the foreword the author explains why he decided to write the SMSL before jumping into solving the problem at hand. 

Why do you want to stop? How do you feel after masturbating? Are you addicted? What are you supposed to do instead? These are some of the questions that SMSL asks. Each chapter is titled with such a question and follows a progression beginning with why one wants to stop masturbating and ending with how one can stop masturbating. SMSL ends with the explanation that the skills learned and needed to stop masturbating can be applied to any vice. The overall end of SMSL is to teach the reader how to conquer any vice and take back control of their life.

Cover.
 The cover of SMSL was illustrated by nude model and artist Mandy Cat Kitana of Mandyland (www.mandyland.com).

Adamant (1811 ship)

Adamant was launched in 1811 at Blythe. She was a general trader that sailed to such places as Sierra Leone, Riga, New York, Quebec, and Australia. In 1821 she <a href="transportation%20%28punishment%29">transported</a> <a href="convict">convict</a>s to Sydney, New South Wales. She wrecked in 1828 on a voyage from Quebec back to London.

Career.
"Adamant" enters "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Register">Lloyd's Register</a>" in 1811 with W. Wright, master, and Wm. Clark, owner. The 1812 volume of "Lloyd's Register" gave her master as Miller, and her trade as London transport. 

"Adamant" departed England on 29 March 1821 under the command of William Ebsworthy and with surgeon James Hamilton, and arrived at Port Jackson on 8 September. The guard consisted of detachments of the 34th and 48th regiments under orders of Lieutenant Thompson of the 34th. She embarked 144 male convicts, of whom two died on the voyage.

Captain Ebsworthy, Chief Officer Mr. Easterby, Second Officer William Collins, Third Officer John Mossman, and Dr. Hamilton were all intending to depart on "Adamant" for Batavia on 25 September. Their voyage was delayed however by a court case involving Captain Ebsworthy and the steward of the "Adamant", George Farris, who accused Ebsworthy of embezzling government stores and converting them to his private purposes. There were counter accusations and lengthy depositions taken from Farris, Dr. Hamilton, John Mossman and Sergeant James Barclay of the 48th regiment. When the enquiry was finished the results were submitted to the Governor for consideration. "Adamant" did not depart Sydney until about 22 October.

On 14 May 1822, "Adamant", bound for London, was in dock at Bengal. She was expected to depart in June.

Loss.
Late in 1828 "Adamant", Brown, master, was lost at the Bird Islands, off of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. A later report has "Adamant", Brown, master, sold at "Gluce" Bay (probably <a href="Glace%20Bay">Glace Bay</a>. A more detailed account reports that her crew abandoned "Adamant" as she was sailing from Quebec to London. "Endeavour", of Hull, fell in with her on 15 November and drove her onshore near Gluce Bay. She was then sold, together with all her cargo, for £70 under the authority of the Collector of Excise.

Tuff (character)

Tuff (ブン "Bun") is one of the main characters in "". Tuff is an ally of <a href="Kirby%20%28character%29">Kirby</a> and often plays a large role. He is voiced by <a href="Rika%20Komatsu">Rika Komatsu</a> in the Japanese version of the show, and in the dub by <a href="Kayzie%20Rogers">Kayzie Rogers</a>.

Physical Appearance.
Tuff is a young boy about a head taller than Kirby. His skin is a light orange color, as is the top of his hair. The tips are green, with the colors separated by a zigzag. His hair goes down over his eyes (which are never seen). He only wears a pair of purple shorts held up by a single red suspender, and green shoes. It is also possible that Tuff is short for Tufford.

Personality.
Tuff is a rowdy and mischievous young boy who has a good heart, but not much in the way of intellect to go with it. He loves to play games like soccer and do other outdoor activities. He also loves to pull pranks, though usually on people like Dedede so he can easily justify it. (However, sometimes his pranks cause trouble for the people of the village as well.) Tuff lives for having fun and doesn't take many things seriously. However, he often falls victim to Dedede's plots like many others in Dream Land thanks to that.

Relationships.
Tuff is the brother of <a href="Tiff%20%28character%29">Tiff</a> and the son of the Cabinet Minister <a href="Sir%20Ebrum">Sir Ebrum</a> and <a href="Lady%20Like%20%28character%29">Lady Like</a>. Despite how the two are polar opposites in many ways, he and his sister get along well, though she doesn't like when he pulls pranks and causes trouble and often tries to ruin his fun. Tuff also tends to argue with his mother when it comes to things like studying, but his father is more lenient with him. Tuff's best friends aside from Kirby are the three Cappychildren <a href="Honey%2C%C2%A0Iro%2C%20and%C2%A0Spikehead">Honey, Iro, and Spikehead</a>, and they're often seen playing together. He doesn't usually take <a href="King%20Dedede">King Dedede</a> and his tricks very seriously, but he tries to help his sister stop him or to try making Dedede's life as difficult as he can. He and <a href="Escargoon">Escargoon</a> do not normally get along, but he once bribed Tuff, Kirby and Fololo and Falala into scaring King Dedede with the reward of candy and getting back at King Dedede in Escargoon Squad. Tuff rarely interacts with <a href="Meta%20Knight">Meta Knight</a> and his followers.

Trouble in Mind (Big Bill Broonzy album)

Trouble in Mind is an <a href="album">album</a> by American <a href="blues">blues</a> musician <a href="Big%20Bill%20Broonzy">Big Bill Broonzy</a>. It was released on February 22, 2000 by <a href="Smithsonian%20Folkways">Smithsonian Folkways</a>. The album consists of <a href="folk%20music">traditional folk</a>, blues, and spiritual songs featuring Broonzy accompanying himself on <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a> and a guest appearance by <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>. Suffering from cancer, Broonzy realized his time was limited and hence recorded extensively between 1956 and 1957. While most of the work draws from the album "Big Bill Broonzy Sings Country Blues" (1957), arranged by <a href="Moses%20Asch">Moses Asch</a> and <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Smith%20%28jazz%29">Charles Edward Smith</a>, "Trouble in Mind" is also sourced from concert broadcasts and interviews recorded late in Broonzy's career.

Like other albums issued by Smithsonian Folkways, "Trouble in Mind" has been kept in print; the production quality of the album is higher than most installments of the label's catalogue. An accompanying booklet, arranged by Jeff Place and Anthony Seeger, includes photos and notes documenting Broonzy's stint with Folkways. While "Trouble in Mind" only represents the latter portion of Broonzy's career, music critics have recognized the album for its historically significant material.

Background and recording.
An extensively recorded bluesman, <a href="Big%20Bill%20Broonzy">Big Bill Broonzy</a> left the United States to tour Europe in 1951, becoming the first <a href="Chicago%20blues">Chicago blues</a> player to perform for European audiences. Broonzy previously spent time in Iowa, where he honed a repertoire which remained a fixture of his concerts and recordings for the remainder of the decade. With bluesmen such as <a href="Muddy%20Waters">Muddy Waters</a> and <a href="Howlin%27%20Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a> <a href="Amplifier">amplifying</a> their music, resulting in the popularity of the <a href="electric%20blues">electric blues</a>, Broonzy decided to reinvent himself as a <a href="folk%20blues">folk blues</a> musician to capitalize on another prevailing trend, the <a href="American%20folk%20music%20revival">folk revival</a>. 

<a href="Folkways%20Records">Folkways Records</a> producer <a href="Moses%20Asch">Moses Asch</a> and New York-based <a href="jazz">jazz</a> critic <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Smith%20%28jazz%29">Charles Edward Smith</a> took an interest to Broonzy's folk material. Ashe envisioned recording Broonzy in a style reminiscent of his 1930s records: as a solo performer accompanying himself on <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a>. According to musicologist Jeff Place, Broonzy's stripped-down approach brought his singing and lyrics to the forefront. Although fusing folk with blues influences was common during the folk revival, particularly with <a href="Lead%20Belly">Lead Belly</a> and <a href="Josh%20White">Josh White</a>, Broonzy was arguably the most chronicled bluesman of the era. Asch and Smith had partaken in several projects with Broonzy, including albums and interviews, before he was forced to retire from music in early 1957, due to complications from <a href="throat%20cancer">throat cancer</a>.

Music.
"Trouble in Mind" is largely culled from a recording session in New York produced by Asche and Smith; originally, Folkways released the studio work on the <a href="album">album</a> "Bill Broonzy Sings the Country Blues" in 1957. The final two tracks were taped during a concert at <a href="Northwestern%20University">Northwestern University</a>. Spoken introductions and commentary were spliced together from interviews conducted by <a href="deejay">DJ</a> <a href="Studs%20Terkel">Studs Terkel</a> on the radio station <a href="WFMT">WFMT</a>. Aside from <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a> on <a href="banjo">banjo</a> for a live rendition of "<a href="This%20Train">This Train (Bound for Glory)</a>", all the instrumentation is credited to Broonzy.

The majority of the original songs were written by Broonzy, who was also credited as musical arranger on some <a href="cover%20version">cover</a>s. On "<a href="Key%20to%20the%20Highway">Key to the Highway</a>", he collaborated with <a href="piano">piano</a> player <a href="Charlie%20Segar">Charlie Segar</a>, creating the melody while Sagar wrote most of the lyrics. Broonzy's willingness to address sensitive political issues are especially evident on "Joe Turner No. 2", "When Will I Get to Be Called Man", and "Black, Brown, and White Blues", <a href="topical%20song">topical song</a>s that other record labels refused to release. Included on "Trouble in Mind" are renditions of traditional folk and blues compositions such as "<a href="Frankie%20and%20Johnny%20%28song%29">Frankie and Johnny</a>", "<a href="It%20Hurts%20Me%20Too">When Things Go Wrong (It Hurts Me Too)</a>", and "<a href="C.C.%20Rider">C.C. Rider</a>". These tracks, frequently played by Broonzy live, ensured that his albums would have instant appeal for white audiences in the manner of various <a href="country%20blues">country blues</a>-based LPs that had resulted from the rediscovery of old-time blues artists.

Release and reception.
<a href="Smithsonian%20Folkways">Smithsonian Folkways</a> released "Trouble in Mind" on February 22, 2000; the label keeps the album in print. The album's liner notes were supplied by musicologist Jeff Place, who wrote detailed Broonzy's career and the songs complied on the album. Considering "Trouble in Mind" compiles recordings produced in the 1950s, the album is enhanced by higher sound quality, more so than most Smithsonian Folkways releases.

In his review for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, <a href="Richie%20Unterberger">Richie Unterberger</a> said of "Trouble in Mind": "[Broonzy] was likely not in peak physical shape by this time, you wouldn't suspect that from the quality of the performances. His vocals are still rich and moving on a relaxed selection of originals and standards". "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>"' reviewer Patrick Jones found the presentation of the album is encouraging "the listener to interact with the music, to learn about it, and to explore its link to history", and "is a rewarding and culturally enriching experience". Criticism from "<a href="No%20Depression%20%28magazine%29">No Depression</a>" noted the novelty of Broonzy's Folkways material as a part of the vogue for "country-turned-urban blues singers as facsimiles of some idealized rural past"; however, it commended the historical significance of the album.

Disappearance of April Pitzer

April Beth Pitzer (February 19, 1974 – declared <a href="Declared%20death%20in%20absentia">legally dead</a> August 27, 2012) was an American former <a href="model%20%28person%29">model</a> who <a href="missing%20person">disappeared</a> in 2004 under unusual circumstances in <a href="Newberry%20Springs%2C%20California">Newberry Springs, California</a>, a small community in the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a>. Her case has been profiled on the series "<a href="Disappeared%20%28TV%20series%29">Disappeared</a>", and was one of the most high-profile cold cases in California.

Background.
At the time of her disappearance, Pitzer had relocated from <a href="Longview%2C%20Texas">Longview, Texas</a> to California after losing custody of her two daughters. Pitzer, a former model, suffered from <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>, and had claimed to her mother that she was working as a waitress in California during the spring of 2004; however, she had stopped taking her bipolar medication and was living in homeless shelters and on the streets.

Disappearance.
Pitzer was last seen in Newberry Springs on June 28, 2004 by Chuck Hollister, a man in his sixties with whom Pitzer had been residing at the time. According to Hollister, he dropped Pitzer off at a bus stop in Newberry Springs after helping her pack her belongings; Pitzer had been planning to return to Arkansas to live with her mother, Gloria Denton, who later confirmed this. Pitzer never arrived in Arkansas, and has not been seen or heard from since.

Investigation.
On September 9, 2004, an anonymous transit employee in <a href="Barstow%2C%20California">Barstow, California</a> notified police that they had been told by a woman riding their bus that she knew Pitzer, and that she was "in a hole." The same week, a message written inside a <a href="rest%20stop">rest stop</a> on <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Oregon">Interstate 5</a> in <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> was discovered; the message read: "Want to find missing girl from Arkansas? I-15 freeway, 3 miles east of Barstow." According to Pitzer's mother, she suspected her daughter may have been targeted as a result of her past as a <a href="informant">drug informant</a> in Texas. Additionally, a cafe proprietor in Newberry Springs stated she had hired Pitzer as a waitress several days before her disappearance; she claimed that on her second day of work, Pitzer arrived with what appeared to be a blackened eye.

Law enforcement examined Hollister as a potential suspect as he was the last person to see Pitzer. Hollister, however, denied any involvement, claiming that after dropping Pitzer off at the bus stop, he had helped a friend move to Oregon and was out of the state; when he returned, she was gone.

Mine searches.
The message discovered in the rest stop led law enforcement to hone in on <a href="Mining">mine</a> shafts in <a href="San%20Bernardino%20County%2C%20California">San Bernardino County</a> outside Newberry Springs in their search for Pitzer. In 2005, it was discovered that Chuck Hollister's close friend, Dan Dansbury, who went by the name "Dan Dan," owned the Red Dog Mine, a mine that was abandoned in 1979. During a December 2005 search in and around the Red Dog mine, police recovered a white suitcase and scattered clothing that Denton claimed was Pitzer's, which was scattered across a radius. 

Hanging in an abandoned shack approximately from the Red Dog Mine, near <a href="Ludlow%2C%20California">Ludlow</a>, police discovered a <a href="nightgown">nightgown</a> belonging to Pitzer tied in a <a href="Hangman%27s%20knot">hangman's noose</a>. Also found in the shack were strips of gauze and a bottle of <a href="iodine">iodine</a>. Additional clothing was discovered buried under a deck attached to another shack near the Indian Queen, a separate mine in the vicinity. Multiple articles of clothing discovered were identified by Pitzer's mother as clothes that she had sent her daughter in <a href="CARE%20Package">care package</a>s. Numerous searches were undertaken at the Red Dog Mine; inside, searchers discovered additional belongings of Pitzer's, including boots and undergarments, as well as a mattress and a sheet stained with blood and bodily fluids. 

Hollister died of <a href="cancer">cancer</a> in September 2006, and denied any involvement in Pitzer's disappearance. In November 2009, Pitzer's mother was contacted by Hollister's friend, Dan Dansbury, while organizing a search for her daughter in California. Denton met with Dansbury, who was on his deathbed; he claimed to have known Pitzer, but denied any involvement in her disappearance. However, after their meeting, Dansbury reportedly told a friend that the previous searches for Pitzer at the Red Dog Mine were "in the right place," but he added that they "hadn't gone far enough." Samples of dirt and other debris from the mine were collected for potential forensic evidence.

Pitzer was declared legally dead on August 27, 2012. In 2016, after years of searches, Pitzer's mother stated that she was confident her daughter's remains were not in the mine, although they may have been at one time before being relocated.

Later developments.
A local <a href="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a> manufacturer in Newberry Springs, Steve Wilkinson, was considered a suspect in Pitzer's disappearance, possibly related to her past as a drug informant. It was reported that Wilkinson had been seen in the area of the Red Dog Mine on September 4, 2015, one day prior to a planned trip to <a href="Amarillo%2C%20Texas">Amarillo, Texas</a>. En route to Amarillo on September 5, Wilkinson was killed when the <a href="Cessna%20310">Cessna 310</a> airplane in which he was a passenger crashed into a mountain near <a href="Silverton%2C%20Colorado">Silverton, Colorado</a>.

George Vanderveer

George Vanderveer was an early 20th-Century American "conservative Seattle lawyer" who defended <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW) members during the union's years of "deepest trouble."

Background.
Vanderveer was born on August 2, 1875.

Career.
During and after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Vanderveer became a champion of IWW laborers. Beyond cases (below), he even wrote Governor <a href="Ernest%20Lister">Ernest Lister</a> of <a href="Washington%20State">Washington State</a> to stop the arrest of "Wobblies" because their imprisonment was a "grievous social and industrial wrong."

1916 Everett massacre.
"See <a href="Everett%20Massacre">Everett Massacre</a>"

In 1916, Vanderveer defended Wobblies accused in this strike and massacre.

1918 Chicago Espionage Act trial.
Vanderveer defended 101 IWW members, including IWW co-founder <a href="Bill%20Haywood">Bill Haywood</a>, in a Chicago espionage trial in 1918 ("one of the largest criminal trials in American history").

During World War I the U.S. government moved strongly against the IWW. On September 5, 1917, U.S. <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a> agents made simultaneous raids on dozens of IWW meeting halls across the country. Minutes books, correspondence, mailing lists, and publications were seized, with the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a> removing five tons of material from the IWW's General Office in Chicago alone. This seized material was scoured for possible violations of the <a href="Espionage%20Act%20of%201917">Espionage Act of 1917</a> and other laws, with a view to future prosecution of the organization's leaders, organizers, and key activists. Based largely on documents seized on September 5, a Federal Grand Jury in Chicago indicted 166 IWW leaders for conspiring to hinder the draft, encourage desertion, and intimidate others in connection with labor disputes, under the new <a href="Espionage%20Act">Espionage Act</a>. 101 went on trial en masse before Judge <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a>, which began on April 1, 1918. Vanderveer led their defense and argued that most evidence predated the war. They were all convicted — including those who had not been members of the union for years. The judge sentenced 35 to 5 years, 33 to 10 years, and 15 to 20 years; the remained 30 received clemency. (Sentenced to prison by Judge Landis and released on bail, Haywood fled to the <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</a>, where he remained until his death in 1928).

1919 Seattle General Strike.
"See <a href="Seattle%20General%20Strike">Seattle General Strike</a>"

In 1919, Vanderveer defended AFL and IWW members in this five-day general work stoppage by more than 65,000 workers in Seattle, Washington, which lasted February 6–11.

1919 Centralia massacre.
"See <a href="Centralia%20massacre%20%28Washington%29">Centralia massacre (Washington)</a>"

In late 1919, Vanderveer returned from Chicago to Seattle, where he defended eleven men arrested and charged with the murder of <a href="Warren%20Grimm">Warren O. Grimm</a> during the Centralia massacre, which landed local lawyer <a href="Elmer%20Smith">Elmer Smith</a> in jail among others.

During the trial, Vanderveer is reputed to have said: The IWWs say there must be a fundamental change and that fundamental change must be in the reorganization of industry, for public service, so that the purpose shall be that we will work to live and not merely live to work. Work for service rather than work for profit... This is a big case, counsel says, the biggest case that has ever been tried in this country, but the biggest thing about these big things is from beginning to end it has been a struggle on the one side for ideas and on the other side to suppress those ideas!

1928 Seattle teachers v. Sharples.
Vanderveer represented teachers in " Seattle High School Teachers Chap. No. 200 of the American Federation of Teachers v. Sharples". When teachers formed a union (<a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Teachers">American Federation of Teachers</a>, Local 200), the state school board imposed a "<a href="Yellow-dog%20contract">yellow dog</a>" contract on them. AFT Local 200 fought the yellow dog rule in court; Vanderveer defended them.

<doc id="54900759" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54900759" title="The Jewish Confederates">
The Jewish Confederates

The Jewish Confederates is a 2001 history book authored by Robert N. Rosen about Jews who supported the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a> and served in the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> of 1861–1865. Rosen, a Jewish lawyer with a master's degree in History from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, is the author of two more books about the city of <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. The book received both praise and criticism in many academic journals.

Summary.
Rosen gives an overview of Jewish participation in the Confederate States Army (CSA) during the American Civil War of 1861-1865, and their attachment to the extant <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>. Even though Jews were only 2,000 out of 1 million members of the CSA, Rosen shows that both <a href="Sephardi%20Jews">Sephardi Jews</a>, who had been in the South for a long time, and <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a>, most of whom were immigrants from Prussia, joined the Confederacy alongside their neighbors and served honorably. While the book mentions well-known Jewish Confederates like <a href="Judah%20P.%20Benjamin">Judah P. Benjamin</a>, <a href="David%20Levy%20Yulee">David Levy Yulee</a>, <a href="Abraham%20Myers">Abraham Myers</a> and <a href="Phoebe%20Pember">Phoebe Pember</a>, and lesser known Jewish Confederates like <a href="Henry%20M.%20Hyams">Henry M. Hyams</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20F.%20Jonas">Benjamin F. Jonas</a>, <a href="Adolph%20Proskauer">Adolph Proskauer</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Hart">Alexander Hart</a>, it is also full of vignettes about the lives of ordinary Southern Jewish families who sent their sons to the war front, as well as their daughters and mothers, who often acted as Confederate informants.

Critical reception.
In "<a href="The%20Journal%20of%20Southern%20History">The Journal of Southern History</a>", Leonard Dinnerstein, a professor of history at the University of Arizona, praised the book for its academic rigour. Similarly, in a review for "The South Carolina Historical Magazine", Gordon C. Rhea called the book "a thoughtful and readable narrative packed with information and insights" as well as "a fine piece of scholarship and a fascinating read." Reviewing it for "Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies", Sheldon S. Cohen praised it as "an engaging and expansive portrayal of a small, yet singular, group of Americans and their involvement in one of this nation's most determinative and monumental conflicts." In "The Georgia Historical Quarterly", Mark K. Bauman of the Atlanta Metropolitan College praised the book as "a carefully documented, nuanced study based on numerous primary sources that is grounded in the appropriate historical literature."

In a review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Roy%20Hoffman">Roy Hoffman</a> called the book "comprehensive and readerly" but he stressed that it was "sometimes inconsistent as social analysis." Similarly, in "The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography", Frederic Krome of <a href="The%20Jacob%20Rader%20Marcus%20Center%20of%20the%20American%20Jewish%20Archives">The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives</a>, called the book "well-written and organized" but "not very analytical." In particular, he criticized Rosen's effort to "downplay" Southern anti-Semitism.

Reviewing it for "<a href="Shofar%20%28journal%29">Shofar</a>", Robert E. May, a professor of history at <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a>, highlighted Rosen's contention that Jews were better accepted in the South than the North both in the Antebellum era and during the war. He concluded by calling the book "a truly invaluable contribution to American Jewish historiography." In "Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association", David T. Gleeson, a professor of history at <a href="Northumbria%20University%20">Northumbria University </a>, criticized Rosen for failing to delve into the differences between anti-Semitism in the North and the South. Nevertheless, he praised the book for filling "a major gap in the historiography of the Confederacy."

Robert A. Taylor, a professor of History at <a href="Florida%20International%20University">Florida International University</a>, praised the book as "a significant contribution to the literature of the Civil War South and American Jewish history." He also noted that the Jewish culture of the Antebellum South was mostly gone after the war, as new Jewish immigrants distanced themselves from it. Meanwhile, in "American Jewish History", Jonathan D. Sarna, the Joseph H. and Belle R. Braun Professor of American Jewish History at <a href="Brandeis%20University">Brandeis University</a>, dismissed the book as "an apologia, a pious bow to the 'religious of the <a href="lost%20cause">lost cause</a>'." Specifically, he criticized the chapters about <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a> on the grounds that Rosen's "sources are meager and his one-sidedness embarrassing." He concluded by reiterating that the book "does justice to one side of the conflict alone."

Home Fire (novel)

Home Fire is the seventh novel by <a href="Kamila%20Shamsie">Kamila Shamsie</a>, reimagining <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>'s <a href="Antigone%20%28Sophocles%20play%29">"Antigone"</a> in a contemporary setting. It has been longlisted for the <a href="Booker%20Prize">Booker Prize</a>.

Development and publication history.
Shamsie began "Home Fire" at the suggestion of London theater director Jatinder Verma that Shamsie write a modern update of the "Antigone"; she was interested in the project and quickly decided on what the story she would tell, though she preferred to pursue it as a novel rather than a play. 

The 288-page novel was published on August 15, 2017, by <a href="Riverhead%20Books">Riverhead Books</a>.

Synopsis.
"Home Fire" is a contemporary reimagining of the Greek <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a> "Antigone". Akin to the play's five acts, the novel is set in five locations: London; <a href="Amherst%2C%20Massachusetts">Amherst, Massachusetts</a>; Istanbul; <a href="Raqqa">Raqqa</a>, Syria; and <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, Pakistan.

Reception.
The novel received widely favorable reviews. In <a href="The%20Guardian">"The Guardian"</a>, Natalie Haynes said, "Shamsie’s prose is, as always, elegant and evocative. "Home Fire" pulls off a fine balancing act: it is a powerful exploration of the clash between society, family and faith in the modern world, while tipping its hat to the same dilemma in the ancient one." In <a href="The%20Washington%20Post">"The Washington Post"</a>, Katharine Weber said the novel "blazes with the kind of annihilating devastation that transcends grief." <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">"New York Times"</a> book critic <a href="Dwight%20Garner%20%28critic%29">Dwight Garner</a> said "Home Fire" "builds to one of the most memorable final scenes I've read in a novel this century."

"Home Fire" has been longlisted as a candidate for the 2017 <a href="Man%20Booker%20Prize">Man Booker Prize</a>.

2017 Sierra Leone mudslides

Early in the morning on August 14, 2017, after three days of torrential rainfall, devastating floods and <a href="mudslide">mudslide</a>s occurred in and around <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>'s capital city, <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a>.

As of August 20, the number of confirmed deaths is 499; hundreds of others are missing and feared dead. More than 3,000 people were left homeless and hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed by the mudslides. Occurring during a particularly wet <a href="rainy%20season">rainy season</a>, the disaster was exacerbated by the city's situation at or below <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, poor infrastructure, and drainage system. 

Local organizations and the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> handled the initial recovery efforts, and the international community has also been supplying aid.

Impact.
According to the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a>'s <a href="Climate%20Prediction%20Center">Climate Prediction Center</a>, <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> had been in the midst of a particularly wet <a href="rainy%20season">rainy season</a>, with the capital city of <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a>, in the <a href="Western%20Area">Western Area</a> of the country, experiencing 41 inches (104 cm) of rainfall leading up to the mudslides since July 1, 2017 – nearly tripling the area's seasonal average. The Sierra Leone meteorological department did not issue a warning ahead of torrential rainfall to hasten evacuations from danger zones; from August 11 to 14, Freetown received three consecutive days of downpours, which led to severe flooding in the city and its surrounding suburbs. Flooding is an annual threat for the area: in 2015 floods killed 10 people and left thousands homeless.

Overlooking Freetown, <a href="Sugar%20Loaf%20%28Freetown%29">Sugar Loaf</a> mountain partially collapsed, triggering <a href="mudslide">mudslide</a>s in the early morning of August 14 which damaged or completely submerged several houses and structures, killing residents – many still asleep – who were trapped inside. The <a href="Regent%2C%20Sierra%20Leone">Regent</a> suburban district is considered to have endured the most devastation; a mountainous settlement 15 miles east of Freetown, Regent had been obliterated when nearby hillsides collapsed around 6:00 <a href="GMT">GMT</a>. Other areas which reported serious damage include the settlements Motormeh, Kamayamah, Kaningo, Dworzak, New England, Kroobay, Mountain Cut, George Brook, Big Warf, and Wellington. Director Kelfa Karbo of the relief agency Street Child described a "domino effect" which resulted in structures demolishing other properties as the mudslides progressed.

There are 499 confirmed fatalities, and thousands more are feared dead. Initial estimates placed the number at 205, but recognized that in all likelihood the toll would rise with rescue efforts ongoing and about 600 people still missing. More than 3,000 people have been left homeless and hundreds of properties damaged or submerged by the mudslides and flooding.

Contributing factors.
The severity of the destruction was exacerbated by a combination of factors. Freetown, a densely populated and congested city occupied by about 1.2 million people at the time of the disaster, lies at or below <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, and is flanked by heavily forested mountain ranges. It suffers from a long-term issue with poor urban development programs: "The government is failing to provide housing for the poorest in society", said Jamie Hitchen of the <a href="Africa%20Research%20Institute">Africa Research Institute</a>, while noting attention to unregulated construction is only received after a crisis. The lack of enforcement of a <a href="Moratorium%20%28law%29">moratorium</a> led to the encroachment of <a href="flood%20plain">flood plain</a>s by unorganized settlements and municipal works, resulting in narrower water passageways. In flooding events, Freetown's drainage systems are often blocked by discarded waste, especially in the city's more impoverished communities, contributing to higher levels of <a href="surface%20runoff">surface runoff</a>.

The construction of large homes in hillside areas and unrestricted <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> for residential purposes weakened the <a href="slope%20stability">stability of nearby slopes</a> and incurred significant adverse <a href="soil%20erosion">soil erosion</a>. Within a decade leading to the disaster, Sierra Leone cleared approximately 800,000 hectares of forest cover – the country's <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Civil%20War">civil war</a>, fought between 1991 and 2002, is also a cause of deforestation. The nation's Environmental Protective Agency reported a <a href="reforestation">reforesting</a> mission in the region two weeks prior to the floods and mudslides which was ultimately unsuccessful.

Aftermath.
Later in the day, President <a href="Ernest%20Bai%20Koroma">Ernest Bai Koroma</a> made a public address to Sierra Leone in a national broadcast, declaring a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> and the establishment of a relief centre in Regent. He urged the nation, still recovering from the aftermath of the <a href="West%20African%20Ebola%20virus%20epidemic">Ebola outbreak</a>, to remain unified: "Our nation has once again been gripped by grief. Many of our compatriots have lost their lives, many more have been gravely injured and billions of Leones’ worth of property destroyed in the flooding and landslides that swept across some parts of our city". He also addressed the coordination of registries in Freetown that provide aid for residents left without shelter. On August 15, the president declared seven days of <a href="National%20day%20of%20mourning">national mourning</a>, which would take effect immediately.

Local organizations, military personnel, and the <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Red%20Cross%20Society">Red Cross of Sierra Leone</a> contributed to immediate excavation and recovery efforts, and they worked amid rainfall. The continued downpours and damaged passageways disrupted relief efforts, as did the topography of affected areas. The Red Cross donated 11 vehicles to assist in traveling to isolated areas, while the <a href="United%20Nations%20Office%20on%20Drugs%20and%20Crime">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) sent a joint team of forensic officers and specialized rescue units with trained dogs. People initially used their bare hands and shovels to dig through mud and debris where machines were not yet available. The Connaught Hospital mortuary in Freetown was overwhelmed by nearly 300 bodies in the first day alone, forcing workers to lay victims on floors and outside the building to be identified. Due to the lack of manpower and threat of disease, bodies were buried in <a href="mass%20grave">mass grave</a>s on August 16 at two sites in <a href="Waterloo%2C%20Sierra%20Leone">Waterloo</a>.

Sierra Leone's Office for National Security (ONS) advised survivors to evacuate flood-prone areas. Additional evacuations took place when aerial images of a hillside adjacent from Sugar Loaf revealed a threat of another mudslide which could impact a much wider area. Response teams were deployed to two public schools converted into displacement centres to distribute food, water, and medical supplies. By August 16, workers in Regent and Kaningo began constructing emergency latrines and a 10,000 liter water harvesting system. Stagnant waters raised fears for outbreaks of waterborne diseases; to combat the threat, <a href="water%20tank">storage tank</a>s and <a href="Portable%20water%20purification">purification tablet</a>s, as well as educational courses on hygiene were provided by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Children%27s%20Fund">United Nations Children's Fund</a> (UNICF).

Koroma made an appeal to the international community for relief. Several European countries responded with donations: the United Kingdom provided £5 million (<a href="GBP">GBP</a>) for clean drinking water and medicine, Ireland donated €400,000 (<a href="euros">EUR</a>), Spain donated €50,000 (EUR) and assembled a technical forensic team, and Switzerland spent <a href="Swiss%20francs">CHF</a>400,000 to provide sanitation and first-aid kits . West African country donations included $500,000 (<a href="USD">USD</a>) from Togo, medical supplies distributed by Liberia, and pledges for support by Guinea and Nigeria. Other governments such as China donated $1 million (USD) through their embassy in Freetown, and Israel sent an envoy supplying food and medical supplies. In response to the disaster, the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) arranged contingency plans to mitigate potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a> and <a href="cholera">cholera</a>. The UN's <a href="International%20Organization%20of%20Migration">migration agency</a> allocated $150,000 (USD) in initial-response aid and mobilized personnel in Sierra Leone to assist in rescue operations and distribute supplies to survivors. The <a href="World%20Food%20Programme">World Food Programme</a> (WFP) provided rations for 7,500 people. The <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU) authorized €300,000 (euros) for humitarian aid on August 16. On August 17, the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Societies">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a> (IFRC) approved CHF4.6 million worth of aid to be distributed through the Sierra Leone Red Cross agency for use over a 10-month period.

It is a U-shaped motel complex consisting of two cottages and three multi-unit sections totaling 18 rooms. Its first cottage was built in 1946, a second was built in 1946, and the remainder was built in 1947-50, in 1951-52, and in 1952. They are one-story frame buildings on poured concrete foundations, which "reflect the Minimal Traditional style popular in the 1940s and 1950s." The complex was deemed notable as "The cottages and the motel units composing the Riggins Motel exemplify the combination and transition of early roadside

The State of Africa

The State of Africa: A History Of Fifty Years Of Independence (republished in 2011 as The State of Africa: A History Of The Continent Since Independence) is a 2005 book by British writer <a href="Martin%20Meredith">Martin Meredith</a>.

Background and synopsis.
The State of Africa in-depth investigation into the history of Africa since European decolonisation. Meredith examines the many challenges much of Africa has faced including civil conflict and lawlessness, government corruption and dictatorships. Africa is described as a continent where "bad-news stories (famine, genocide, corruption) massively outweigh the good (<a href="History%20of%20South%20Africa%20%281994%E2%80%93present%29">South Africa</a>)."

Reception.
In "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" Pamela Bone wrote that in "this big, exhaustive history Martin Meredith leaves us in little doubt as to what he believes is the primary cause of Africa's pain: its corrupt, tyrannical, incompetent, thieving, "vampire-like" leaders...It documents, country by country, decade by decade, a depressing litany of wars, revolutions, dictatorships, famines, genocide, coups and economic collapse". While Bone wrote that the book is an "impressive history, well told" she criticised the fact that "the book misses the spirit of Africa, the joyfulness and strength of the people, which persists despite their appalling hardships, and which gives hope".

Writing in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" Alex Duval Smith described "The State of Africa" as a "dispassionate analysis" that "does more than perhaps he (Meredith) realises to set the past 50 African years in a continuum"

Chris Nkwatsibwe, a human rights activist from <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a> praised the book. Nkwatsibwe wrote that "Meredith works with the colossal spatial and temporal span of this subject with ease, weaving chapters together in a loose chronological order to present the narrative as a patchwork quilt of Africa, rather than as a rigid country-by-country timeline".

It was released in North America on June 21, 2005. It is loosely based on the 2005 film "" and features stills from the movie in the game.

Gameplay.
The game's story mode loosely follows the plot of the film and follows <a href="Herbie">Herbie</a> as the car races to win the championship.

If the player fails to place first in any race, they are shown a <a href="Game%20Over">Game Over</a> screen and booted to the menu to start over.

There are 8 different tracks in the game and there is no multiplayer mode available. The player controls Herbie throughout each race. The player can collect stars on the road in order to activate tricks that boost Herbie's overall speed and slow down other racers.

Reception.
"Disney's Herbie: Fully Loaded" received mostly mixed reception from critics, who praised the game's 3D graphics while disparaging about the poor <a href="Artificial%20Intelligence">AI</a> for opposing racers and the lack of alternative modes. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Frank Provo called the game a "missed opportunity" and felt that <a href="Lindsey%20Lohan">Lindsey Lohan</a> voice samples would have "pepped things up". <a href="GameZone">GameZone</a>'s Anise Hollingshead felt that "Herbie: Fully Loaded" was "ho-hum" and felt that there "isn't much to this average game". "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" remarked that the game was "a lackluster effort at capturing the spirit of the film."

The graphics were widely praised, however. GameSpot's Frank Provo called them the game's "lone bright spot" and was impressed by the level of detail for Herbie in particular.

Richard Orlowski is a <a href="Poland">Polish-born</a> <a href="Polish%20Americans">American</a> soccer coach.

Career.
Playing.
In his native Poland, Orlowski played as a forward for clubs such as Gofabet Gorzkowice, Piotrcovia Piotrkow Tryb and WKS Grunwald Poznan. Later, in 1984, he fled to <a href="Austria">Austria</a> to escape from the political regression and the Soviet subjugation of his home country. He was then granted refugee status in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, anglicized his name from Ryzsard Orlowski to Richard, and settled in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. While living in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, he played for a succession of Polish-American teams and even had a stint in the Cayman Islands.

Nepal.
Orlowski was selected as <a href="Nepal%20national%20football%20team">Nepal national football team</a> assistant coach along with Polish-American <a href="Jack%20Stefanowski">Jack Stefanowski</a>- who was head coach.
Their best result was a 2-1 victory over <a href="India%20national%20football%20team">India</a> in the <a href="2013%20SAFF%20Championship">2013 SAFF Championship</a>, before getting knocked out by <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> en route to the final.

Anguilla.
Orlowski was assigned the <a href="Anguilla%20national%20football%20team">Anguilla</a> head coach role in 2015, taking ownership of a team composed of construction workers, bankers, teachers, and boat builders. During his time there, he brought increased professionalism and tactical intuition to the country. Also, he recorded three friendly wins- two against the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands%20national%20football%20team">British Virgin Islands</a> and one versus a non-FIFA nation, <a href="Saint%20Martin%20national%20football%20team">Saint Martin</a> by galvanizing the players with the possibility of moving up the World Rankings into performing well. Those three triumphs were <a href="Anguilla%20national%20football%20team">Anguilla</a>'s first wins in the space of fourteen years.

But when the FIFA World Rankings were updated, Anguilla had not received any points even though the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands%20national%20football%20team">British Virgin Islands</a> were a FIFA nation. FIFA never rectified the error and, when Anguilla had to play <a href="Nicaragua%20national%20football%20team">Nicaragua</a> for a 2018 World Cup qualifier, they lost twice on a combined score of 8-0; Orlowski resigned after eight months in charge.

Belize.
Assigned <a href="Belize%20national%20football%20team">Belize</a> manager ahead of the <a href="2017%20Copa%20Centroamericana%20">2017 Copa Centroamericana </a>, he led the Jaguars to a 0-0 draw with <a href="Panama%20national%20football%20team">Panama</a> in their opening fixture. However, his team lost all their remaining group stage matches after that. His main ambition for the national team is to get youth involved in soccer at a much younger age and also wants more friendlies against better opposition as it would be advantageous to the teams chemistry and quality of play.

He is also involved with the youth sides of the <a href="Belize%20national%20football%20team">Belize national team</a> from the under-15 level. On account of this, he has drafted some younger players into the senior squad.

J. S. Parker

John Shotton Parker (1944 – 14 August 2017), known professionally as J. S. Parker, was a New Zealand painter.

Parker was born in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, but spent most of his life living in <a href="Blenheim%2C%20New%20Zealand">Blenheim</a>. He studied art at Christchurch's <a href="Ilam%20School%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Ilam School of Fine Arts</a>, graduating in 1966, and had his first exhibition in 1967. He became an art teacher at Blenheim's <a href="Marlborough%20Girls%27%20College">Marlborough Girls' College</a> in 1970 whilst also pursuing his own art. In 1975, he was named <a href="Frances%20Hodgkins%20Fellowship">Frances Hodgkins Fellow</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Otago">University of Otago</a>.

During his time as Hodgkins fellow he became friends with former Fellowship recipient <a href="Ralph%20Hotere">Ralph Hotere</a>, who became Parker's unofficial artistic mentor. Parker later honoured his late friend with the massive 2016 work "Plain Song for Ralph (the Hotere canvas)", which was painted on canvas which had previously been owned by Hotere. Hotere's art influenced Parker's, though Parker's paintings were aimed more at evoking an "emotional response from the viewer, rather than conveying a message".

Parker's work progressed from photographs and drawings to oil pastels, before he began working in oil paint on large canvases, the medium for which he is best known. His key works are large-scale <a href="colour%20field">colour field</a> abstracts inspired by the <a href="Marlborough%2C%20New%20Zealand">Marlborough</a> landscape that surrounds Blenheim. His most well-known series of works was the extended "Plain Song" series, which he worked on from the 1980s until his death. These works were an attempt to express the colours of the Marlborough landscape in musical terms, "creating a symphonic tone poem in paint [...], with bold, heavily impastoed canvases which nevertheless have both subtle delicacy and a rigorous use of geometry".

Parker was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20New%20Zealand%20Order%20of%20Merit">New Zealand Order of Merit</a> in the <a href="2002%20Birthday%20Honours">2002 Queen's Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours</a> for services to painting. He was later named the 2014 Marlborough Living Cultural Treasure. Parker's life and work was celebrated in the 2009 book "J.S. Parker: Plain song", written by art historian Damian Skinner.

Parker died from lung cancer on 14 August 2017. He was survived by Kate, his wife of 45 years, and their daughter.

<doc id="54901551" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54901551" title="Pleiness Lake">
Pleiness Lake

Pleiness Lake, also known as Lost Lake, is a natural lake located in <a href="Eden%20Township%2C%20Mason%20County%2C%20Michigan">Eden Township, Mason County, Michigan</a> in the northwestern part of <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Michigan's Lower Peninsula</a>.

History.
Native American settlement.
Tribes of the <a href="Ottawa%20people">Ottawa people</a> native to Michigan originally spanned from the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a> to the nearby <a href="Pere%20Marquette%20River">Pere Marquette River</a>, with tribes migrating throughout the seasons between settlements. In 1855, a federal treaty between nine tribes of the Ottawa, which would later be known as the <a href="Little%20River%20Band%20of%20Ottawa%20Indians">Little River Band of Ottawa Indians</a>, established the Pashawsey Indian Reserve, which settled the Ottawa into modern day Eden Township along the l1ake. Ownership of the lands in the area was never determined and many moved back to the <a href="Manistee%20River">Manistee River</a> or had left lumber camps in Wisconsin by 1900.

Pleiness family.
In 1881, John Jacob Pleiness moved into the area at the age of seven with his mother and father after their home at Fort Hope was destroyed in a fire. In the 1890s, Pleiness established a blacksmith shop on the southeastern plot near the lake, which was then known as Lost Lake, and later established a farm. Between 1887 and 1909, the <a href="Mason%20and%20Oceana%20Railroad">Mason and Oceana Railroad</a> operated directly south of Lost Lake.

The area and much of the United States experienced an extreme drought in the summer of 1930 shortly before the <a href="Dust%20Bowl">Dust Bowl</a> period, which occurred for the most of the decade. Pleiness' son, John Jacob Pleiness Jr., reported in September 1930 that the lake's waterline fell about to its lowest level in over 40 years.

Modern history.
In October 1941, communities proposed to change the name from Lost Lake since there were another 25 lakes in Michigan with the same name. It was proposed to rename Lost Lake to Pashawsey Lake in October 1941 to recognize the Pashawsey Indian Reserve that once incorporated the lake into its area, with "pashawsey" meaning "light" in the Ottawa language. At the meeting, the decision of Mason County supervisors was to rename Lost Lake to Pleiness Lake. In the summer of 1942, there was little resort activity at the lake. John Jacob Pleiness died on November 22, 1948.

Since then, cottages have been constructed on the lake and the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Natural%20Resources">Michigan Department of Natural Resources</a> and county constructed a boat launch and <a href="outhouse">outhouse</a> in the southern portion of the lake.

Ecology.
Fish.
In the early 1900s, the Michigan Board of Fish Commissioners began planting fish into Pleiness Lake. On August 15, 1905, 75 adult largemouth bass were introduced and an additional 1,500 largemouth bass <a href="Fingerling%20%28fish%29">fingerlings</a> were introduced on July 12, 1906.

Fish inhabiting Pleiness Lake include: 

Plants.
In the 1940s, <a href="Eurasian%20watermilfoil">Eurasian watermilfoil</a>, a submerged aquatic plant, was introduced into North America and became invasive. Similar to other lakes in Michigan, Pleiness Lake has had to combat the growth of Eurasian watermilfoil, with the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Michigan Department of Environmental Quality</a> partnering with Mason County to spray the lake when necessary.

Nataša Jovanović

Nataša Jovanović (; born April 14, 1966) is a politician in <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. She has served several terms in the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Serbia">National Assembly of Serbia</a> as a member of the far-right <a href="Serbian%20Radical%20Party">Serbian Radical Party</a>.

Early life and career.
Jovanović was born in <a href="Kragujevac">Kragujevac</a>, then part of the <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Serbia">Socialist Republic of Serbia</a> in the <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>. She was employed with the Zastava Impeks company from 1987 to 1989 and was a tour guide with the agencies "Holidej" and "Kontiki" from 1991 to 1996.

Political career.
Jovanović joined the Serbian Radical Party in 1992. She was one of the party's candidates for the Kragujevac division in the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201993">1993 Serbian parliamentary election</a>, receiving the twenty-fourth position out of twenty-nine on the party's <a href="electoral%20list">electoral list</a>. The Radicals won five seats in the division, and she was not subsequently included in the party's parliamentary delegation. (From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one-third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates from successful lists in numerical order, while the remaining two-thirds would be distributed amongst other candidates on the lists by the sponsoring parties. Jovanović could have been included in the Radical Party's delegation notwithstanding her low position on the list, although in the event she was not.)

Yugoslav parliamentarian.
Jovanović was elected to the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Serbia%20and%20Montenegro">Assembly of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>'s Chamber of Citizens in the <a href="Yugoslavian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201996">1996 election</a>. The Radical Party won sixteen seats and initially served in <a href="Opposition%20%28parliamentary%29">opposition</a> to a governing alliance led by the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20Serbia">Socialist Party of Serbia</a> and its Montenegrin allies. In 1998, the Radical Party joined a <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a> in Serbia led by the Socialist Party; the following year, the party also became part of the government at the federal level in Yugoslavia.

In December 1998, Jovanoviċ was one of nineteen Serbian politicians denied entry to <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> countries for what was described as her role in bringing about a restrictive Law on Public Information, which critics regarded as an attempt to suppress the activities of opposition journalists. A news report from this time described her as chair of the Radical Party's organization in <a href="%C5%A0umadija">Šumadija</a>.

Jovanović sought re-election to the Chamber of Citizens in the <a href="Yugoslavian%20general%20election%2C%202000">2000 Yugoslav election</a>. She was defeated when the Radical Party failed to win any mandates in Kragujevac.

Member of the National Assembly of Serbia.
Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2000, such that the entire country became a single electoral division. Jovanović received the fourteenth position on the Radical Party's list for the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202000">2000 Serbian parliamentary election</a>; the party won twenty-three mandates, and she was included in its delegation to the assembly. (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for parties to distribute the mandates out of numerical order. Although Jovanović did not automatically receive a seat in parliament by virtue of her position on the list, she was included in the party's delegation all the same.) The election was won by the <a href="Democratic%20Opposition%20of%20Serbia">Democratic Opposition of Serbia</a>; the Radicals served in opposition, often using obstructionist parliamentary tactics. In April 2001, the legislature was adjourned when Jovanović refused to leave the floor after exceeding her allotted time to speak. On another occasion, Jovanović splashed water on speaker <a href="Nata%C5%A1a%20Mi%C4%87i%C4%87">Nataša Mićić</a> during a contentious debate. She took part in a rally at the legislature in October 2003, saying that the Radical Party would seek to bring down the "criminal" government as soon as possible.

The Radical Party emerged as the largest party in the assembly after the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202003">2003 elections</a>, although it did not command a majority and did not form government. Jovanović received the twelfth position on the party's list and was once again included in its parliamentary delegation. At a 2006 rally, she described <a href="Ratko%20Mladi%C4%87">Ratko Mladić</a>, at the time a fugitive and accused Serbian <a href="war%20criminal">war criminal</a>, as "the pride of the Serbian nation, unlike those in power."

In June 2006, Jovanović was appointed as a member of Serbia's delegation to the <a href="Parliamentary%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20Europe">Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe</a>. On one occasion, she took part in a delegation seeking an international investigation into human organ trafficking in <a href="Kosovo%20and%20Metohija">Kosovo and Metohija</a>.

Jovanović received the thirty-second position on the Radical Party's list in the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202007">2007 parliamentary election</a> and was again included in its delegation after the election. The Radicals again won the largest number of seats but, as before, did not command a majority. Jovanović led the Radical Party's negotiating team in talks with <a href="President%20of%20Serbia">Serbian president</a> <a href="Boris%20Tadi%C4%87">Boris Tadić</a> on the formation of a new government; she argued that a member of the Radical Party should be nominated for <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Serbia">prime minister</a> in accordance and that Tadić should resign as president due to what was described as a poor showing by his <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28Serbia%29">Democratic Party</a>. This advice was predictably not taken, and the Radicals remained in opposition. In May 2007, however, a temporary alliance between the Radicals, the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20Serbia">Socialist Party of Serbia</a>, and the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20of%20Serbia">Democratic Party of Serbia</a> (not to be confused with Tadić's party) resulted in Jovanović being selected as a deputy speaker of the assembly.

A new parliamentary election was held in <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202008">2008</a>, with inconclusive results. Jovanović, again included in her party's parliamentary group, took part negotiations between the Radicals, the Socialists, and the Democratic Party of Serbia toward forming a new government with <a href="Vojislav%20Ko%C5%A1tunica">Vojislav Koštunica</a> as prime minister. The Socialists ultimately declined to participate in the deal, instead forming an alliance with Tadić's <a href="For%20a%20European%20Serbia">For a European Serbia</a> alliance. Notwithstanding this, Jovanović was again selected as a deputy speaker in June 2008.

When the Tadić government arrested and extradited former <a href="Bosnian%20Serb">Bosnian Serb</a> leader <a href="Radovan%20Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87">Radovan Karadžić</a> on <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s charges in 2008, Jovanović was reported to have said of Tadić in a parliamentary debate, “Let the sun never shine upon him, let his name be deleted, let God punish him. He is the biggest traitor.” On another occasion, she defended Radical Party leader <a href="Vojislav%20%C5%A0e%C5%A1elj">Vojislav Šešelj</a>'s statement that the killer of <a href="Zoran%20%C4%90in%C4%91i%C4%87">Zoran Đinđić</a> should be recognized as a hero of the Serb people on par with <a href="Gavrilo%20Princip">Gavrilo Princip</a>.

The Radical Party experienced a significant split in late 2008, and several leading figures formed the breakaway <a href="Serbian%20Progressive%20Party">Serbian Progressive Party</a>, a more moderate conservative grouping under the leadership of <a href="Tomislav%20Nikoli%C4%87">Tomislav Nikolić</a> and <a href="Aleksandar%20Vu%C4%8Di%C4%87">Aleksandar Vučić</a>. Jovanović remained with the Radicals and was considered a prominent ally of hardline party leader <a href="Vojislav%20%C5%A0e%C5%A1elj">Vojislav Šešelj</a>.

Serbia's electoral system was reformed again in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Jovanović received the twelfth position on the party's electoral list; the party failed to cross the <a href="electoral%20threshold">electoral threshold</a> to win representation in the assembly. She was again included on the Radical list for the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202014">2014 election</a>, in which the party once again failed to win representation.

The Radicals returned to parliament with the <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202016">2016 election</a>, winning twenty-two mandates. Jovanović, who received the ninth position on the list, was declared re-elected and represented the party in talks with president Tomislav Nikolić prior to the formation of a new government. The results of the talks were a foregone conclusion; the Progressives and their allies commanded a majority of seats in parliament. The Radical delegation used their consultation session to demand that Nikolić resign, and the meeting was reported to have ended after thirty seconds.

Jovanović is currently a member of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee and the committee on the right of the child, a deputy member of the defense and internal affairs committee, a member of Serbia's delegation to the <a href="NATO%20Parliamentary%20Assembly">NATO Parliamentary Assembly</a> (where Serbia has associate status), and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="China">China</a>.

The work was published in conjunction with his <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> series and a major exhibition at the British Museum.

Background and synopsis.
"Germany: Memories of a Nation" explores the complex and disjointed history of Europe's foremost power.

MacGregor focuses on objects and ideas, people and places which still resonate in modern Germany such as <a href="Johannes%20Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</a>'s <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a>, the fairytales of the <a href="Brothers%20Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a> and <a href="Meissen%20porcelain">Meissen porcelain</a>.

Reception.
<a href="David%20Blackbourn">David Blackbourn</a>, an academic focusing on German history wrote in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" that MacGregor's book was "immensely readable and sharply intelligent". Blackbourn wrote that MacGregor's choice of objects "serve to illustrate the historic fragmentation of the German lands". Blackbourn concluded that MacGregor "has written a remarkable set of reflections on the objects and places of German memory".

Writing for "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" Rebecca K Morrison praised "Germany: Memories of a Nation". Morrison described the book as "an impeccably erudite cultural history of Germany". Morrison wrote that the "book is immaculately researched, timely and important".

"<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" also received the book positively with the book described as "deeply felt, carefully conceived and an important addition to any consideration of the shape not only of modern Germany but of Europe as a whole".

Brute (album)

Brute is the second <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> of <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> musician <a href="Fatima%20Al%20Qadiri">Fatima Al Qadiri</a>. A <a href="protest%20music">protest album</a> inspired by events such as the <a href="2015%20Baltimore%20protests">2015 Baltimore protests</a> and the <a href="Ferguson%20unrest">Ferguson unrest</a>, the album regards the authoritarian power of law enforcement in the United States and the illusion of democracy existing in the western part of the world. Its cover art by <a href="Josh%20Kline%20%28artist%29">Josh Kline</a>, Babok Radboy, and Joerg Lohse is a photograph of one of the "police <a href="teletubbies">teletubbies</a>" found in Kline's art piece "Freedom," which was intended to present how civil rights were being destroyed in the 21st century. 

"Brute" features samples of the Ferguson protest, an <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> report of <a href="Occupy%20Wall%20Street">Occupy Wall Street</a> by <a href="Lawrence%20O%27Donnell">Lawrence O'Donnell</a>, and an interview with a former member of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">LAPD</a> regarding the power of the police. Released by <a href="Hyperdub">Hyperdub</a> in March 2016, "Brute" garnered significant media coverage for it's unique political message and was listed in the "Top Ten Protest Albums Of 2016" by "<a href="Shadowproof">Shadowproof</a>", where Kevin Gosztola described it as "the kind of album that will carry even more resonance in the era of President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>." However, some critics with more mixed opinions towards the album called it too similar to Qadiri's previous releases and found many of the songs too formless.

Background.
Qadiri's experience of having her civil rights violated came from living in Kuwait during its <a href="Invasion%20of%20Kuwait">invasion by Iraqi forces</a> in 1990. It wasn't until she attended college that she moved to the United States. As she discussed how she viewed the nation before she relocated there, "I thought America was kind of like "<a href="Saved%20By%20The%20Bell">Saved By The Bell</a>" and "<a href="Fresh%20Prince%20of%20Bel%20Air">Fresh Prince of Bel Air</a>". I'd never set foot there before going to college, and my perception of it was very far removed from the truth, you know? I was just consuming American TV shows like any other kid around the world, thinking, "Oh, it looks so cute." In terms of experience in protesting, Qadiri was at a counterdemonstration at a 1999 <a href="Annual%20Meetings%20of%20the%20International%20Monetary%20Fund%20and%20the%20World%20Bank%20Group">IMF World Bank</a> meeting: "I have never seen more cops in my entire life. There were cops on horses, on bicycles, on bikes, in cars, and helicopters. I had a very rude awakening; the illusions of American democracy were destroyed almost immediately." She was also involved in the <a href="Protests%20against%20the%20Iraq%20War">New York City protests against</a> the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>.

Qadiri began writing her second album around February/March 2015 while having to be a room in her Kuwait home due to a knee injury. She was looking at a "horrific news cycle" on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>, being "moved" by seeing protests going on in places such as <a href="Ferguson%20unrest">Ferguson</a> and <a href="2015%20Baltimore%20protests">Baltimore</a>. This inspired Qadiri to make a record about protesting halfway into writing her next record. As she explained in a "<a href="Thump%20%28Vice%29">Thump</a>" interview, "I also saw it as a challenge. <a href="Protest%20music">Protest music</a> is a real genre, and there have been a lot of seminal protest records. I just feel like this is a subject that's moving a lot of people right now." The first track completed for the album was "Blood Moon," the last "Oubliette."

Concept.
Compared by some reviewers to <a href="Hyperdub">Hyperdub</a> founder <a href="Kode9">Kode9</a>'s album "Nothing" (2015) and his pieces about <a href="sonic%20warfare">sonic warfare</a> such as "Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect, and the Ecology of Fear" (2009), "Brute" deals with themes of <a href="Neoliberalism">neoliberal</a> <a href="fascism">fascism</a>, <a href="authoritarianism">authoritarianism</a>, the rising power of the <a href="law%20enforcement">law enforcement</a> system in the United States, and how democracy in the western part of the world is just a mirage. Qadiri described it as a record in the vein of "<a href="What%27s%20Going%20On%20%28Marvin%20Gaye%20album%29">What's Going On</a>" (1971) by <a href="Marvin%20Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> but also explained that it wasn't really a protest record: “It’s a meditation, but a very unpleasant one. Protest music is a call-to-action, and this is not a call-to-action because I don’t know what the action should be. I’m not offering any solutions, just saying that this is the reality.” Qadiri said that she titled the album "Brute" as a "counterpoint to the word thug, and how people over the last two years have been speaking about thugs in the media." She also reasoned that the word "contains a lot of savagery, but also, in English, it has a dandyish, almost 1950s-ish sense."

Composition and sound design.
"<a href="Now%20%28newspaper%29">Now</a>" critic Kevin Ritichie wrote that "Brute" has a <a href="minimal%20music">minimal</a> structure that "sometimes ris[es] in urgency before falling into a deceptive calm." "Brute" is the most grime-infused LP in Qadiri's discography, where signature sounds of the genre such as gunshot-like percussion, swirling melodies, and police siren sound effects are heard many times throughout. Burnett found it unlike most other grime music in that it is "rarely propulsive or tailored for the dancefloor, but rather shift and shake convulsively under the weight of stark, metronomic beats, swathes of sub-bass and icy synth swirls." As <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> journalist Andy Kellman wrote, "Brute" uses a combination of real and simulated representations of protests that gives it a <a href="surreal">surreal</a> feal. 

Because of its themes regarding powerful law enforcement, "Brute" has a hopeless tone coming from its use of what Jake Hulyer labeled as a "cold and stark" structure with an "unwelcoming atmosphere:" audio snippets of political rallies, <a href="minor%20chord">minor</a> <a href="chord%20progressions">chord structures</a>, synthesized horns and choirs, and what Lhooq described as "apocalyptic bass growls." While "Brute" is based on an American topic, Qadiri wanted to make the instrumentals "universal" for listeners from other nations across the globe to resonate with it. "Brute"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s oppressive vibe comes from the drum parts, specifically how the "rhythms jerk at unnatural angles" and "beats drop like gas canisters," wrote Stephen Worthy of "<a href="Mixmag">Mixmag</a>". As Derek Staples of "<a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a>" wrote, "an ever-lurking, low-end wake" is used to represent an omnipresent police force on songs like “Battery” and “10-34," "volatile harmonic breaks signifying the frequent outbursts of unmitigated violence." 

There are very few glimpses of a hopeful vibe on the album, such as the electronic harps on the song "Fragmentation." As Joseph Burnett of "Dusted" wrote, "Listen carefully, and there is a certain melodicism nestled in the heart of this album, but its tone is despairing and subdued, glimmers of light in a dark and uncaring world." Burnett suggested that the reason for this was to show the "uncaring, uncomprehending barrier that has been erected between authority and the demos, between the powerful and the rest of us."

"Brute" primarily uses three audio sources, which Qadiri garnered via <a href="Youtube">Youtube</a>. One of them is a live recording of the Ferguson protests where a policeman says "you are no longer peacefully assembling" through a <a href="Long%20Range%20Acoustic%20Device">Long Range Acoustic Device</a>, which is played over an <a href="Industrial%20music">industrial</a> instrumental on the opening track "Endzone." Another one is <a href="Lawrence%20O%27Donnell">Lawrence O'Donnell</a>'s <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> report about <a href="Occupy%20Wall%20Street">Occupy Wall Street</a>, which Qadiri chose for his "classic American media news anchor voice," which is played on the track "Blows." It is filtered in reverb and "half-shrouded" in synthesizers to put the listener far away from what's really going, wrote Rory Gibb of "<a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a>". Another one of these samples is an interview with a former <a href="LAPD">LAPD</a> sergeant named Cheryl Dorsey about the power of police officers which plays on the LP's closer "Power" over synthesized glass-breaking sounds. The samples are used at a minimum "just to illustrate the context, to set the tone," Qadiri explained.

Cover art.
In early 2015, American artist <a href="Josh%20Kline%20%28artist%29">Josh Kline</a> produced an installation titled "Freedom" at the <a href="New%20Museum">New Museum</a> in New York. It centers on four "Police <a href="Teletubbies">Teletubbies</a>" in <a href="SWAT">SWAT</a> gear that block an area modeled after <a href="Zuccotti%20Park">Zuccotti Park</a>, the location of the <a href="Occupy%20Wall%20Street">Occupy Wall Street</a> protests. The art piece was meant to showcase how civil rights were being destroyed in the 21st century and uses Qadiri's cover of "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>." The cover art for "Brute" consists of a photograph of one of the teletubbies altered by Babak Radboy to give it face hair, broken blood vessels, and chapped lips. Qadiri explained, "He Frankensteined it. He gave it life. He took something that was an object, and made it into a living, breathing monster." Writer Patrick Hinton put the cover art in his gallery for "Mixmag" of "The best record artwork of 2016."

Release and promotion.
On 20 January 2016, it was announced that "Brute" would be released on 4 March 2016 and "Battery" was released. On 23 February 2016, "Mixmag" held a Q&A with Brown and premiered the track "Power." <a href="Hyperdub">Hyperdub</a> officially released the album on 4 March 2016. 

Critical reception.
"Brute" garnered a significant amount of media coverage that focused on as well as honored its political theme, "Thump" calling it "the Powerful Political Album We've Been Waiting For." Writing for "<a href="Hyperallergic">Hyperallergic</a>", Cynthia Cruz stated, "Like great poetry, her music provides just the right amount of world and politics with her references to protests, news clips and police force while allowing the listener enough space within each song and within the album to make her own connections." "<a href="Shadowproof">Shadowproof</a>" ran a list by Kevin Gosztola titled the "Top Ten Protest Albums Of 2016," where "Brute" was included. Gosztola summarized that it was "the kind of album that will carry even more resonance in the era of President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>," while in a review of the record for "<a href="Clash%20%28magazine%29">Clash</a>" magazine, Sofia Leadbetter stated, "Al Qadiri has invoked her own personal brand of protest in a world in which discussion over that right has become ever more charged." In a nine-out-of-ten review for "Mixmag", Worthy favorably compared the record to the works of <a href="Laurie%20Anderson">Laurie Anderson</a> as a "doyenne of experimental <a href="electronica">electronica</a>."

In a review for "Consequence of Sound", Staples discussed the LP's ideas in relation to the Republican debates that were going on shortly before the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">2016 United States presidential election</a>; he praised the LP for mostly being an instrumental record, reasoning that her choice of not having any vocalist sing words show that "Al Qadiri has an acute awareness of human communication and the subtle impact of its many non-spoken factors." Gibb's review of "Brute" discussed how Qadiri used tropes from popular music styles in all of her works, opining that "the overt narrative framings of "Brute" [and her previous LP "Asiatisch" (2014)] highlight the way Al Qadiri's work seeks to create collages of themes — a bricolage approach that’s effective in bringing together ideas and allowing them to interact, even if the musical results aren't always as successful." He wrote that "the moments when "Brute" really comes to life are those when it leaves overt references behind and heads towards starker and more emotionally ambiguous places." 

A common criticism in more mixed reviews of "Brute" were towards it not being different enough from previous releases by Qadiri as well as most of the tracks being too formless. In a review for "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>", Kevin Lozano called it a "frustrating mish-mosh of middling and artful." He highlighted its unique concept and felt the tracks that used samples were the best on the record; however, he also opined that most of the other songs were "shapeless tracks" that had too many elements borrowed from Qadiri's past releases. "<a href="Resident%20Advisor">Resident Advisor</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Andrew Ryce wrote that most of the LP's samples were its only parts that distinguished it from previous releases: "Otherwise, we're given titles like "10-34" and "Oubliette," words that gesture towards a theme without providing substance." A reviewer for "<a href="musicOMH">musicOMH</a>" called it a "frustrating album" and a "missed opportunity," writing that it "has the ability to unnerve and unsettle to the point of creating a paranoid world for the listener" but too much of the songs are "formless pieces that drift instead of acting as a counterpoint to the oppression that lets "Brute" down."

Ben Beaumont-Thomas of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" praised the political theme as "bracing" but opined that the album wasn't "enjoyable to listen to" due to its "limp compositions" and use of sounds like <a href="Fairlight%20CMI">Fairlight CMI</a>-esque voices and "ultra-synthetic" drums that became a cliche in underground electronic music due to the popularity of works by acts such as <a href="Oneohtrix%20Point%20Never">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and Visionist. Daniel Bromfield of "<a href="Spectrum%20Culture">Spectrum Culture</a>" described the album, despite its concept, as "actually pretty, almost pastoral" and joked that it "could just as easily be a concept album about spending a weekend on grandma’s farm." In fact, he went as so far as to say the album was much more enjoyable to listen to without knowing its context: "Taken purely on musical terms, Brute is an excellent album. As a concept album, it’s a flop."

Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism

Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism is a work on the history of the Jewish <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> by <a href="Gershom%20Scholem">Gershom Scholem</a>, published in 1941.

Topics.
In his introduction to "Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism", Scholem blames Jewish scholars of the <a href="Haskalah">Haskalah</a> period, who, because of what he decried their antagonism and neglect of the study of Kabbalah, allowed the field be all but monopolized by "charlatans and dreamers".

Scholem's chapter on <a href="Merkabah%20mysticism">Merkabah mysticism</a> and Jewish gnosticism deals mainly with the mystical books <a href="Hekhalot%20literature">the "Lesser Hechalot" and the "Greater Hechalot"</a>, tracts written and edited between the 2nd and 6th centuries C.E. Scholem also writes on other tracts like "<a href="Shi%27ur%20Qomah">Shiur Koma</a>", the "<a href="Book%20of%20Enoch">Book of Enoch</a>", "<a href="Sefer%20Yetzira">Sefer Yetzira</a>" and the "<a href="Bahir">Sefer Habahir</a>".

In the book, Scholem, citing other scholars, observed similarities between the "Sefer Yetzirah" (Book of Creation) and early Islamic gnosticism.

Scholem subsequently explores the works of the German Jewish school of Hasidim, and of the works of <a href="Abraham%20Abulafia">Abraham Abulafia</a>. Next, the most detailed investigation in Scholem's work is on the best known work of Jewish mysticism, the <a href="Zohar">Zohar</a>. After that, Scholem explores <a href="Isaac%20Luria">Isaac Luria</a>'s teachings and the Eastern European <a href="Hasidic">Hasidic</a> movement.

Commemoration.
On the 50th anniversary of the book's publication, a conference of scholars convened in Berlin in Scholem's honor.

The Scharhörnbake was the most important <a href="daymark">daymark</a> on the German <a href="north%20sea">north sea</a> coast for a long time. First erected in 1661 by the City of <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> on the sandbank <a href="Scharh%C3%B6rn">Scharhörn</a> and south side of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> estuary, it was rebuild over centuries and equipped with a room for <a href="shipwreck">shipwreck</a> refugees from 1840 to 1965 and taken down finally in 1979.

With height of 29.10 meter, it was the highest daymark from 1898 until December 23, 1914 on the north sea coast.

Often detroyed by storms, it was also taken down at war time to make <a href="navigation">navigation</a> harder for enemy ships.

Function.
The main function of the daymark was to <a href="Aid%20to%20navigation">aid navigation</a> for ships around the feared "Scharhörn Reef "into the Elbe coming from the north sea. Many ships wrecked at this dangerous passage. As Hamburg depended most on this, it maintained <a href="Sea%20mark">sea marks</a> around the reefs and the routes via the Südergatt und Nordergatt starting 1440. Coming from the sea the first and most important on <a href="starboard">starboard</a> was the "Rothe Ton". The bearing to the <a href="Great%20Tower%20Neuwerk">Great Tower Neuwerk</a> via the Scharhörnbake was essential to spot is beacon (see red line).

Further bearings using the Great Tower Neuwerk were
Considering the cost and effort to build and maintain the Scharhörnbake as the highest daymark and the Great Tower Neuwerk as the oldest "sea tower" underlines the importance of the Elbe estuary to the city and state of Hamburg.

The room for refugees was added around 1840. Der emergency provisions were routinely refreshed. As the sandbank Scharhön grew into an island by plantations, this function was made obsolete by the first shacks starting 1929.

Appearance.
Form and position varied with each reconstruction. At first is was a wodden structure combining a pyramid and a square. It was not until the mid 19th century that it appeared in its striking form consisting of two diamonds above each other.

Genetic engineering in Asia

India and China are the two largest producers of genetically modified products in Asia. India currently only grows GM cotton, while China produces GM varieties of cotton, poplar, petunia, tomato, papaya and sweet pepper. Cost of enforcement of regulations in India are generally higher, possibly due to the greater influence farmers and small seed firms have on policy makers, while the enforcement of regulations was more effective in China. Other Asian countries that grew GM crops in 2011 were Pakistan, the Philippines and Myanmar. GM crops were approved for commercialisation in <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> in 2013 and in <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> in 2014.

China.
GM crops in China go through three phases of field trials (pilot field testing, environmental release testing, and preproduction testing) before they are submitted to the Office of Agricultural Genetic Engineering Biosafety Administration (OAGEBA) for assessment. Producers must apply to OAGEBA at each stage of the field tests. The Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology developed the first biosafety regulations for GM products in 1993 and they were updated in 2001. The 75 member National Biosafety Committee evaluates all applications, although OAGEBA has the final decision. Most of the National Biosafety Committee are involved in biotechnology leading to criticisms that they do not represent a wide enough range of public concerns.

India.
The release of transgenic crops in India is governed by the Indian Environment Protection Act, which was enacted in 1986. The
Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC), Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) and Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) all review any genetically modified organism to be released, with transgenic crops also needing permission from the Ministry of Agriculture. India regulators cleared the <a href="Bt%20brinjal">Bt brinjal</a>, a genetically modified eggplant, for commercialisation in October 2009. Following opposition from some scientists, farmers and environmental groups a moratorium was imposed on its release in February 2010.

Official Reports on GMO.
There have been four official reports on GMO in India till August 2013 :

Japan.
Two laws regulate food safety and food quality in Japan, the Food Sanitation Law passed in 1947 and the Law Concerning Standardization and Proper Labeling of Agricultural and Forestry Products passed in 1950. The Food Sanitation Law has been amended and updated many times; an amendment dealing with pre-market approval and labeling of GMOs was passed in 2000 and came into effect in 2001. Japan passed laws to implement the <a href="Cartagena%20Protocol%20on%20Biosafety">Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety</a> in September 2003 which came into effect in February 2004 - the Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms (Law No. 97 of 2003).

Authority for approvals for various uses of genetically modified organisms is divided in Japan. The Ministry of the Environment has final approval for all uses of GMOs, but crops for commercial use and live vaccines for
animals first go through the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; viruses for gene therapy and other medical applications first go through the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare; field trials of GM crops and recominant DNA used in biotechnology research first goes through the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; and uses in the process of production of industrial enzymes, etc. goes through the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

Japan has not approved any commodity GM crops to be grown in Japan, but does allow import of agricultural products made from GM crops and food made of imported GM ingredients. Japan does however allow cultivation of GM flowers (e.g. <a href="Blue%20roses">Blue roses</a>).

GM foods must undergo a safety assessment prior to being awarded certification for distribution to the domestic market. The Food Safety Commission (FSC) performs food and feed safety risk assessments.

Certain GM food must be labeled, but this is limited to designated genetically modified agricultural products, which are soybean, corn, potato, rapeseed, cottonseed, alfalfa and beet, and is limited to 32 processed foods which contain soybean, corn and potato, alfalfa and beet, in which recombinant DNA or the resulting protein still exists even after processing. However, processed food in which recombinant DNA or protein is dissolved in or removed during processing, such as soy sauce, soybean oil, corn flakes, millet jelly, corn oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, and others, do not have to be labeled.

Japan does not require traceability, and allows negative labeling ("GMO-free" and the like).

Philippines.
The Philippines bans all GMOs recently overturning existing Department of Agriculture regulations. A petition filed on May 17, 2013 by environmental group Greenpeace Southeast Asia and farmer-scientist coalition Masipag (Magsasaka at Siyentipiko sa Pagpapaunlad ng Agrikultura) asked the appellate court to stop the planting of Bt eggplant in test fields, saying the impacts of such an undertaking to the environment, native crops and human health are still unknown. The Court of Appeals granted the petition, citing the <a href="precautionary%20principle">precautionary principle</a> stating "when human activities may lead to threats of serious and irreversible damage to the environment that is scientifically plausible but uncertain, actions shall be taken to avoid or diminish the threat." Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration in June 2013 and on September 20, 2013 the Court of Appeals chose to uphold their May decision saying the bt talong field trials violate the people’s constitutional right to a "balanced and healthful ecology." The Supreme Court on Tuesday, December 8, 2015 permanently stopped the field testing for Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) talong (eggplant), upholding the decision of the Court of Appeals which stopped the field trials for the genetically modified eggplant. The Philippines Supreme Court also took the unprecedented step and invalidated the Department of Agriculture administrative order allowing the field testing, propagation and commercialization, and importation of GMOs.

Christianity.
Like the rest of France, Paris has been predominantly <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> since the early Middle Ages, though religious attendance is now low. A majority of Parisians are still nominally Roman Catholic. According to 2011 statistics, there are 106 parishes and curates in the city, plus separate parishes for Spanish, Polish and Portuguese Catholics. There are an additional 10 Eastern Orthodox parishes, and bishops for the Armenian and Ukrainian Orthodox Churches. In addition there are eighty male religious orders and 140 female religious orders in the city, as well as 110 Catholic schools with 75,000 students.

The principal Roman Catholic church in Paris is the Cathedral of <a href="Notre-Dame%20de%20Paris">Notre-Dame de Paris</a>, the seat of the Archbishop of Paris. There are two officially recognised pilgrimage sites in Paris: the <a href="Basilique%20du%20Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur%20de%20Montmartre">Basilique du Sacré-Cœur de Montmartre</a> and the <a href="Chapel%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Miraculous%20Medal">Chapel of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal</a>. Cardinal <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Vingt-Trois">André Vingt-Trois</a> became the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Paris">Archbishop of Paris</a> in March 2005.

Almost all Protestant denominations are represented in Paris, with 74 <a href="evangelical">evangelical</a> churches from various denominations, including 21 parishes of the <a href="United%20Protestant%20Church%20of%20France">United Protestant Church of France</a> and two parishes of the <a href="Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20the%20Latter-Day%20Saints">Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints</a>. There are several important churches for the English-speaking community: the <a href="American%20Church%20in%20Paris">American Church in Paris</a>, founded in 1814, was the first American church outside the United States; the current church was finished in 1931. The Saint George's Anglican Church in the 16th arrondissement is the principal Anglican church in the city.

Islam.
The <a href="Grand%20Mosque%20of%20Paris">Grand Mosque of Paris</a>, the oldest mosque in Paris, was dedicated in 1926. It was funded by the French government and built to honour the 38,000 soldiers from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco who died fighting for France in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

In 2011 there were nineteen large mosques within the city limits of Paris, all except the Grand Mosque located in the outer arrondissements of the city, as well as hundreds of small prayer rooms. The number of mosques doubled between 1991 and 2011.

Judaism.
During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Paris was a centre of Jewish learning with famous <a href="Talmudic">Talmudic</a> scholars, such as <a href="Yechiel%20of%20Paris">Yechiel of Paris</a> who took part in the <a href="Disputation%20of%20Paris">Disputation of Paris</a> between Christian and Jewish intellectuals. The Parisian Jewish community was victim of <a href="Persecution%20of%20Jews">persecution</a>, alternating expulsions and returns, until France became the first country in Europe to <a href="Jewish%20emancipation">emancipate its Jewish</a> population during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. Although 75% of the Jewish population in France survived the <a href="Holocaust%20in%20France">Holocaust</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, half the city's Jewish population perished in Nazi concentration camps, while some others fled abroad. A large migration of North Africa <a href="Sephardic%20Jews">Sephardic Jews</a> settled Paris in the 1960s, and represent most of the Paris Jewish community today. There are currently 83 synagogues in the city; The <a href="Le%20Marais">Marais</a>-quarter <a href="Agoudas%20Hakehilos%20Synagogue">Agoudas Hakehilos Synagogue</a>, built in 1913 by architect <a href="Hector%20Guimard">Hector Guimard</a>, is a Paris landmark.

Canada.
Mainland Canada is one of the world's largest producers of GM <a href="canola">canola</a> and also grows GM maize, soybean and sugarbeet. <a href="Health%20Canada">Health Canada</a>, under the Food and Drugs Act, and the <a href="Canadian%20Food%20Inspection%20Agency">Canadian Food Inspection Agency</a> are responsible for evaluating the safety and nutritional value of genetically modified foods. Environmental assessments of biotechnology-derived plants are carried out by the CFIA's Plant Biosafety Office (PBO). The Canadian regulatory system is based on whether a product has novel features regardless of method of origin. In other words, a product is regulated as GM if it carries some trait not previously found in the species whether it was generated using traditional breeding methods (e.g. <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a>, <a href="cell%20fusion">cell fusion</a>, <a href="mutation%20breeding">mutation breeding</a>) or genetic engineering. Canadian law requires that manufacturers and importers submit detailed scientific data to Health Canada for safety assessments for approval. This data includes: information on how the GM plant was developed; nucleic acid data that characterizes the genetic change; composition and nutritional data of the novel food compared to the original non-modified food' potential for new toxins; and potential for being an allergen. A decision is then made whether to approve the product for release along with any restrictions or requirements. Labeling of foods as products of Genetic Engineering or not products of Genetic Engineering is voluntary. The Canadian regulations were reviewed by the Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee between 1999 and 2003, with the conclusion that the current level of regulation was satisfactory. The committee was accused by environmental and citizen groups of not representing the full spectrum of public interests by only having one member of the board of 20 representing <a href="NGO">non-governmental organisation</a>s and for being too closely aligned to industry groups.

Mexico.
In February 2005, after consulting the <a href="Mexican%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Mexican Academy of Sciences</a>, Mexico's senate passed a law allowing to plant and sell genetically modified cotton and soybean. The law requires all genetically modified products to be labelled according to guidelines issued by the Mexican Ministry of Health. In 2009, the government enacted statutory provisions for the regulation of genetically modified maize. Mexico is the <a href="center%20of%20diversity">center of diversity</a> for maize and concerns had been raised about the impact genetically modified maize could have on local strains.
In 2013, a federal judge ordered Mexico’s SAGARPA (Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganadería, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca, y Alimentación), which is Mexico’s Secretary of Agriculture, and SEMARNAT (Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales), equivalent of the EPA, to temporarily halt any new GMO corn permits, accepting a lawsuit brought by opponents of the crop.

United States.
Federal regulation.
The USA is the largest commercial grower of genetically modified crops in the world.

United States regulatory policy is governed by the <a href="Coordinated%20Framework%20for%20Regulation%20of%20Biotechnology">Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology</a> This regulatory policy framework that was developed under the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">Presidency of Ronald Reagan</a> to ensure safety of the public and to ensure the continuing development of the fledgling biotechnology industry without overly burdensome regulation. The policy as it developed had three tenets: "(1) U.S. policy would focus on the product of genetic modification (GM) techniques, not the process itself, (2) only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated, and (3) GM products are on a continuum with existing products and, therefore, existing statutes are sufficient to review the products." In 2015 the Obama administration announced that it would update the way the government regulated genetically modified crops.

For a genetically modified organism to be approved for release, it must be assessed under the <a href="Plant%20Protection%20Act">Plant Protection Act</a> by the <a href="Animal%20and%20Plant%20Health%20Inspection%20Service">Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service</a> (APHIS) agency within the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">US Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) and may also be assessed by the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) and the <a href="Environmental%20protection%20agency">Environmental protection agency</a> (EPA), depending on the intended use of the organism. The USDA evaluates the plant's potential to become a weed. The FDA has a voluntary consultation process with the developers of genetically engineered plants. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which outlines FDA's responsibilities, does not require pre-market clearance of food, including genetically modified food plants. The EPA regulates genetically modified plants with pesticide properties, as well as agrochemical residues. Most genetically modified plants are reviewed by at least two of the agencies, with many subject to all three. Within the organization are departments that regulate different areas of GM food including, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN, ) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). As of 2008, all developers of genetically modified crops in the US had made use of the voluntary process. Final approval can still be denied by individual counties within each state. In 2004, <a href="Mendocino%20County%2C%20California">Mendocino County</a>, California became the first county to impose a ban on the "Propagation, Cultivation, Raising, and Growing of Genetically Modified Organisms", the measure passing with a 57% majority. In May, 2014 Jackson and Josephine Counties in Southern Oregon passed initiatives similar to that passed by Mendocino County; both passing by 2 to 1 margins.

Several laws govern the US regulatory agencies. These laws are statutes the agencies review when determining the safety of a particular GM food. These laws include:


State regulation.
Several states have passed regulations concerning labelling of GM food; <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> passed a GMO labeling bill in May 2013, but the bill will only be triggered after four other states enact similar legislation. On January 9, 2014, <a href="Maine">Maine</a>’s governor signed a bill requiring labeling for foods made with GMO's, with a similar triggering mechanism as Connecticut's bill. In May 2014 Vermont passed a law requiring labeling of food containing ingredients derived from genetically modified organisms. A federal judge ruled Maui's GMO ban invalid.

The campaign was undertaken through sale of generic medicines through exclusive outlets namely “Jan Aushadhi Medical Store”in various districts of the country. The first “Jan Aushadhi Medical Store” was opened on 25 November 2008 at Amritsar in Punjab.In September 2015, the 'Jan Aushadhi Scheme' was revamped as 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana' (PMJAY). In November 2016, to give further impetus to the scheme, it was again renamed as "Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana" (PMBJP).n September 2015, the 'Jan Aushadhi Scheme' was revamped as 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana' (PMJAY).

Criticism.
The concept of Jan Aushadhi Kendra, which was launched at government hospitals to provide patients with medicines at affordable rates, has miserably failed to serve its purpose at Civil Hospital, Ludhiana. Only 20 per cent patients at Civil Hospital are able to benefit from this facility. Most of the stores, set up under the Jan Aushadhi Scheme to provide non-branded generic medicines to all, haven’t stocked common medicines for months for lack of supply. These include medicines for seasonal infections, gas, cough, cold, etc. Officials said the shortage of medicines is due to logistical issues.

The government is looking to tighten the current law which allows farmers to keep seed without paying royalties in a bid to encourage more private investment.

In Brazil the National Biosafety Technical Commission is responsible for assessing environmental and food safety and prepares guidelines for transport, importation and field experiments involving GM products.

Genetic engineering in Oceania

New Zealand and Australia require labeling so consumers can exercise choice between foods that have genetically modified, conventional or organic origins.

Australia.
Genetic engineering in Australia was originally (since 1987) overseen by the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, before the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Gene%20Technology%20Regulator">Office of the Gene Technology Regulator</a> (OGTR) and <a href="Food%20Standards%20Australia%20New%20Zealand">Food Standards Australia New Zealand</a> took over in 2001. The OTGR is a <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Commonwealth%20Government%20entities">Commonwealth Government Authority</a> within the <a href="Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Ageing">Department of Health and Ageing</a> and reports directly to <a href="Australian%20Parliament">Parliament</a> through a Ministerial Council on Gene Technology and has <a href="legislative">legislative</a> powers. It was established as part of the Gene Technology Act 2003 and operates according to the Gene Technology Regulations 2001. The OGTR reports directly to <a href="Australian%20Parliament">Parliament</a> through a Ministerial Council on Gene Technology and has <a href="legislative">legislative</a> powers.
The OGTR decides on license applications for the release of all genetically modified organisms, while regulation is provided by the <a href="Therapeutic%20Goods%20Administration">Therapeutic Goods Administration</a> for GM medicines or <a href="Food%20Standards%20Australia%20New%20Zealand">Food Standards Australia New Zealand</a> for GM food. The individual state governments are then able to assess the impact of release on markets and trade and apply further legislation to control approved genetically modified products.

Genetically modified cotton, canola, and carnations are grown in Australia. Genetically modified cotton has been grown commercially in New South Wales and Queensland since 1996. GM canola was approved in 2003 and was first grown in 2008 and was first approved in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> in 2010.

In 2011 genetically modified plants were grown in all states except South Australia and Tasmania, who have extended their moratoriums until 2019 and 2014. The Queensland and Northern Territory Governments have not implemented any further legislation beyond the national level, but several other states placed bans on planting certain GM crops. In 2007 the New South Wales government extended a blanket moratorium on GM food crops until 2011, but allowed groups to apply for exemptions. New South Wales approved GM Canola for commercial cultivation in 2008, while the Victorian government let the moratorium on GM Canola expire in 2007. Western Australia passed the Genetically Modified Crops Free Areas Act in 2003 and was declared a GM free area in 2004. In 2008 an exception was made for the commercial cultivation of GM cotton in the Ord River Irrigation Areas. Trials of GM canola were carried out in 2003 and in 2010 the Western Australian government allowed the commercialisation of GM canola.

New Zealand.
<a href="Genetic%20engineering">Genetic engineering</a> is a contentious issue in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. no genetically modified food was grown in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and no medicines containing live genetically modified organisms have been approved for use. However, medicines manufactured using genetically modified organisms that do not contain live organisms have been approved for sale, and imported foods with genetically modified components are sold. <a href="Food%20Standards%20Australia%20New%20Zealand">Food Standards Australia New Zealand</a> (FSANZ) must approve any food produced from GM crops, or made using genetically engineered enzymes, before it can be marketed in Australia or New Zealand. FSANZ makes a list of such approvals available on its website.

In 2000 the Government appointed a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> to report on issues relating to <a href="genetically%20modified%20organism">genetically modified organism</a>s (GMOs). The <a href="Report%20of%20the%20Royal%20Commission%20on%20Genetic%20Modification">Report of the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification</a>, released in July 2001, concluded that New Zealand should keep its options open with regard to genetic engineering and to proceed carefully in order to minimise and manage any risks. Field trials have been carried out with GM <a href="Pinus%20radiata">pine</a> trees and <a href="brassica">brassica</a>s.

Prior to the <a href="New%20Zealand%20general%20election%2C%202002">2002 general election</a>, the book "<a href="Seeds%20of%20Distrust">Seeds of Distrust</a>" was published which highlighted possible contamination of imported corn seed with GMO seeds. During the election campaign the book caused an amount of friction between the Labour and Green Parties, referred to as "<a href="Corngate">Corngate</a>" in the media.

Field trials of genetically engineered "<a href="Pinus%20radiata">Pinus radiata</a>" trees is being carried out by SCION, a <a href="Crown%20Research%20Institute">Crown Research Institute</a>. Environmental activists breached the security at the site and damaged 19 of the trees in 2008. No organisation claimed responsibility but a spade left on the site had a "GE-free New Zealand" sticker attached to it. <a href="Brassica">Brassica</a> species have been approved by ERMA for a ten-year field trial in <a href="Canterbury%2C%20New%20Zealand">Canterbury</a>. The conditions that were set for the trial were breached and lobbyists called for an end to the trial.

URZ AP

The URZ AP (Univerzální Ruční Zbraň Automatická Puška) is an assault rifle of Czechoslovak origin.

Development.
The “series of weapons” concept was first pioneered by the French with the Berthier machine rifle and the Stoner 63 was developed by Jiri Cermak in the late 1960s, who also designed the SA Vz. 58 rifle. The weapons series was to replace everything from submachine guns to general purpose machine guns. The URZ APT used the receiver, which in all variants were belt-fed from a cylindrical container. Most unusual for a Warsaw Pact country, the URZ AP was chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO as it was intended for export.

The URZ AP is a 7.62x51mm NATO calibre delayed blowback assault rifle. The weapon uses a rotating bolt delayed blowback operation with 2 lugs with rollers to overcome a quarter twist to accelerate the bolt carrier and unlock. To ease extraction, the barrel has a fluted chamber to prevent ruptured cartridges. The select fire capability fires from closed bolt in semi auto and open bolt in full auto. The belt feed uses a feeding rotor found in the ammo box.

Background and synopsis.
"Selling Apartheid" is an in-depth investigation into the <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20South%20Africa%20during%20apartheid">Foreign relations of South Africa during apartheid</a> and the international propaganda campaign conducted by the apartheid government. Nixon's book contains a large number of previously secret records from archives in South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. It examines the diverse network of apartheid supporters and defenders from global corporations with business operations in South Africa to conservative religious organisations, and even anti-communist black conservatives aligned with right-wing <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> politicians.

The book recalls a moment during Nixon's youth in which he was unwittingly given a <a href="propaganda%20magazine">propaganda magazine</a> produced by South African intelligence services from his grandmother which painted a glowing picture filled with wild animals, sunsets and happy black people on the beach.

Reception.
In the "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Star Tribune</a>" Chris Serres wrote that "Selling Apartheid" "meticulously unpacks the complex web of relationships and covert money flows"

Ron Jacobs, writing for the "Sri Lanka Guardian" praised the book as an "essential addition to the volume of work on South Africa’s apartheid regime" which is "rich in detail".

Music and critical reception.
<a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a>'s Randall Colburn wrote: "“Eve” serves as a contrast to “I Can Tell You About Pain”, as its seven-plus minutes incorporate group chants and menacing synths into its crashing guitars and pummeling percussion, giving the song an eerie epicness." <a href="Stereogum">Stereogum</a> writer Tom Breihan described “Eve” as "a monstrous epic", and stated: "Both songs are punishing in very different ways." <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a> critic Saby Reyes-Kulkarni thought that "I Can Tell You About Pain"'s production style "almost leans in a <a href="black%20metal">black metal</a> direction, giving the song a deceptively quick-and-dirty sound." Reyes-Kulkarni further stated: "This ability to switch from surgically precise to blunt and back again is what keeps Converge continually gripping." 

Andy Cush of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" wrote: "The former ["I Can Tell You About Pain"] is quick and raw, finding the band in full-on firebreathing madness mode; the latter ["Eve"] is an unusually moody epic that clocks in at nearly eight minutes long." Graham Hartmann from <a href="Loudwire">Loudwire</a> described "Eve" as "a more experimental piece of Converge’s catalogue", stating: "Focusing on <a href="doom%20metal">doom</a> and <a href="drone%20music">drone</a> characteristics, Converge stretch out the expansive track in a way that feels truly inspired. <a href="Kurt%20Ballou">Kurt Ballou</a>’s production is top-notch, as always, building a colossal wall of sound for “Eve” that remains dense even in its softest moments."

Thea Tewi

Thea Tewi (1902-1999) was a German-born American sculptor known for her work in stone. During the 1940s she was also a successful award-winning fashion designer who was proclaimed America's top lingerie designer in 1947.

Early life and education.
Thea Wittner was born in Berlin in 1902, although some sources state 1915. She studied at <a href="Berlin%20University%20of%20the%20Arts">Staatliche Kunstakademie</a> under the direction of <a href="Bruno%20Paul">Bruno Paul</a>. In 1938, Thea, her Polish husband Kalman Schlachet and their son Peter came to the USA as Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, and she eventually gained American citizenship in 1944, at which time she took the surname Tewi.

Tewi continued studying throughout her life, attending the <a href="SculptureCenter">SculptureCenter</a> between 1953 and 1956, the <a href="Art%20Students%20League%20of%20New%20York">Art Students League</a> from 1954 to 1955, and in 1955, alongside <a href="Seymour%20Lipton">Seymour Lipton</a> and <a href="Manolo%20Pascual">Manolo Pascual</a>, she went to <a href="The%20New%20School%20for%20Social%20Research">The New School for Social Research</a>. In 1970, she went to research <a href="lost-wax%20casting">lost-wax casting</a> and <a href="bronze">bronze</a> casting in <a href="Pietrasanta">Pietrasanta</a>, Italy.

As fashion designer.
As a bespoke lingerie designer, Thea Tewi was active in New York in the 1940s. Her brand, Tewi Lingerie Inc., was extremely successful, leading to Tewi winning a <a href="Neiman%20Marcus%20Fashion%20Award">Neiman Marcus Fashion Award</a> in 1945. Two Thea Tewi garments are in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>'s <a href="Costume%20Institute">Costume Institute</a>, a silk nightgown called "Busting Out All Over" and an embroidered silk and lace slip called "Ripe Roses." In 1947, the "Textile Colorist" journal, while reporting on Tewi's electric-blanket inspired nightgowns, noted that she had been named America's top lingerie designer. In 1950, Thea Tewi Lingerie merged with another leading company, Dutchess Underwear, to offer a line called "Dutchess Individually Yours by Tewi." In 1950, she returned to sculpting. In the 1960s, although Tewi was now regarded and established as a sculptor, she was still remembered as having been a "leading high fashion lingerie designer."

As artist.
Tewi started out working in metal, but switched to stone as her favourite material, particularly marble and <a href="onyx">onyx</a>. She resumed sculpting in 1950 following her career as a lingerie designer.

Tewi frequently brought Jewish themes and motifs into her sculpture, including a work using the <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew alphabet</a> as its basis which won her the <a href="National%20Arts%20Club">National Arts Club</a> award for religious sculpture in 1966. She represented the United States at the 1969 <a href="Biennale">Biennale</a> in Carrara, Italy.

Tewi exhibited widely from the 1960s to the early 1990s, with solo shows in galleries and venues across the United States and Italy, and participated in a number of exhibitions held across America and in Paris and Italy. Examples of her sculpture are held by the <a href="Smithsonian%20American%20Art%20Museum">Smithsonian American Art Museum</a>, the <a href="Cincinnati%20Art%20Museum">Cincinnati Art Museum</a>, the <a href="Chrysler%20Museum%20of%20Art">Chrysler Museum of Art</a>, and many other institutions.

She died in Queens, New York at the age of 97, in 1999. When her death was recorded, she was entered as Thea Schlachet.

Louis Michel Halbou

Louis Michel Halbou (1730 - 1809) was a French draughtsman and engraver of the pre-Romantic period, specialising in <a href="burin%20%28engraving%29">burin</a>. His work can be found in several public collections such as the Edmond de Rothschild prints collection in the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Versailles%20et%20du%20Trianon">Musée du château de Versailles et du Trianon</a>, the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a> and the <a href="Wellcome%20Trust">Wellcome Trust</a>.

Life.
Few details survive of Halbou's biography. <a href="%C3%89mile%20Bellier%20de%20La%20Chavignerie">Émile Bellier de La Chavignerie</a> states he was born in Paris in 1730 and calls him a "student [ie apprentice] of <a href="Nicolas-Gabriel%20Dupuis">Nicolas-Gabriel Dupuis</a>", whilst another source adds that he must have had quite a long apprenticeship since his art was "flourishing around 1760". He completed several etchings designed by others and also sometimes drew <a href="vignette%20%28graphic%20design%29">vignettes</a> (after <a href="Cl%C3%A9ment-Pierre%20Marillier">Marillier</a>). He mainly worked in Paris, where he was active between 1763 and 1800. He lived on the <a href="Rive%20gauche">Rive gauche</a> "at a parasol merchant's at the Soleil d'or" on <a href="rue%20de%20l%27Ancienne-Com%C3%A9die">rue de la Comédie-Française</a>, then on <a href="rue%20du%20Fouarre">rue du Fouarre</a> and finally on <a href="rue%20de%20l%27H%C3%B4tel-Colbert">rue des Rats</a> (1803), putting him near the print-shop quarter of the city. His students included <a href="Nicolas-Auguste%20Leisnier">Nicolas-Auguste Leisnier</a>.

The March 1763 edition of "L'Avant-coureur" and the 1768 <a href="Salon%20de%20peinture%20et%20de%20sculpture">Salon</a> mention him by the name of "Louis Halbou", as does Hérissant, the Paris publisher of 39 plates by Halbou in a 1769 edition of "Traité de vénerie" by Goury de Champgrand. Halbou had some success engraving moral scenes after works by <a href="Jean-Michel%20Moreau">Jean-Michel Moreau</a>, <a href="Jean-Honor%C3%A9%20Fragonard">Jean-Honoré Fragonard</a> and <a href="Johann%20Eleazar%20Schenau">Johann Eleazar Schenau</a>, with his prints sold by the <a href="Jacques%20Ch%C3%A9reau">"Veuve Chéreau"</a>, Marguerite-Geneviève Chiquet, who had opened a shop on <a href="rue%20Saint-Jacques%20%28Paris%29">rue Saint-Jacques</a> under the sign of the Deux Piliers d'or. <a href="Henri%20Beraldi">Beraldi</a> mentions a 1792 receipt for 1600 livres, a "considerable sum for the time", signed by the merchant Laurent for Halbou's engraving after <a href="Adriaen%20van%20der%20Werff">Adriaen van der Werff</a>'s "La Madeleine dans sa retraite" ("Mary Magdalene in the Desert"). Halbou also contributed to several collections of illustrations and his work is also to be found in the "<a href="Pierre-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Basan">Cabinet Basan</a>" (1771), published by Ruault (1785), the <a href="Pierre-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Didot">Didot jeune</a> (1789) and the "Musée français".

Eduard Zuckmayer

Eduard Zuckmayer (3 August 1890 in <a href="Nackenheim">Nackenheim</a>, <a href="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> – 2 July 1972 in <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>) was a <a href="Germans">German</a> <a href="Pedagogy">pedagogue</a>, <a href="composer">composer</a>, <a href="Conductor%20%28music%29">conductor</a> and <a href="pianist">pianist</a>. He was the older brother of the famous German writer <a href="Carl%20Zuckmayer">Carl Zuckmayer</a> (1896–1977).

Family and Youth.
He was born as the first son of the wealthy factory owner Carl Zuckmayer (1864–1947) who produced <a href="Tamper-evident%20technology">Tamper-evident</a> <a href="Lid%20%28container%29">caps</a> for <a href="whine">whine</a> bottles in Nackenheim which is a whine-growing village on the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> front. The parents of his mother Amalie Zuckmayer (1869–1954), née Goldschmidt, were converted from <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> to <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> whereas he was raised as a <a href="Catholicism">Catholic</a>. From the age of six he got piano lessons. His talent was recognised early. In the age of twelve he started to compose. However he started to study <a href="jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a> but soon quit. In 1909 he took private piano lessons from <a href="Robert%20Kahn%20%28composer%29">Robert Kahn</a> (1865–1951) and <a href="James%20Kwast">James Kwast</a> (1852–1927) in Berlin. He also attended the conductor's school of <a href="Fritz%20Steinbach">Fritz Steinbach</a> (1855–1916) and became a piano pupil of <a href="Lazzaro%20Uzielli">Lazzaro Uzielli</a> (1861–1943) at <a href="Peter%20Cornelius%20Conservatory">Conservatory</a> in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>. In 1914 he got "concert level" as pianist and conductor.

Work.
Germany.
In 1915 he was a conductor at <a href="Staatstheater%20Mainz">City theatre</a> in <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a>. He and his younger brother volunteered as soldiers in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. He got severely wounded and was decorated twice with an <a href="Iron%20Cross%23World%20War%20I">Iron cross</a> 2nd class and later with an Iron cross 1st class. Between 1919 and 1925 he lived in <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> where he for instance performed <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a>'s sonata in D for violin and piano op. 11, No. 2. He worked as a music teacher, conductor and pianist. In 1923 he became co-founder of "Gesellschaft für Neue Musik" (= Society of New Music) in <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a> and <a href="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a>. From 1923 to 1925 he also led a piano class at <a href="Peter%20Cornelius%20Conservatory">Mainz conservatory</a>. At that time he was regarded as a brilliant concert pianist with a high chance for a marvellous career.

But as an enthusiast of German "Jugendmusikbewegung" (= Youth Music Movement) he wanted to participate in the education of a new generation as a countermovement to the tattered political situation at <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a>. He wanted music to be a part of many people's life. In contrary to middle-class culture "Jugendmusikbewegung" enhanced the status of amateur music.
Therefore, he followed a call of pedagogue <a href="Martin%20Luserke">Martin Luserke</a> (1880–1968) to work as a music teacher at "<a href="Schule%20am%20Meer">Schule am Meer</a>", a progressive boarding school on <a href="Juist">Juist Island</a> at <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. There he founded the school's choir and its orchestra which included all pupils. In this progressive school sports, music and <a href="community%20theatre">community theatre</a> were elementary. Musical education was regarded as bridging between the fine arts and life. With his pupils Zuckmayer went on several tours through Germany and got very positive reviews in contemporary newspapers. For one of his compositions his brother Carl visited the school to write the lyrics. Other lyrics were created by Luserke.

When <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a> was <a href="Adolf%20Hitler%2527s%20rise%20to%20power%23Seizure%20of%20control%20.281931.E2.80.931933.29">brought to power</a> in January 1933 the school's work became much more difficult since it counted about one third Jewish pupils and teachers. Due to <a href="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a> and "<a href="Gleichschaltung">Gleichschaltung</a>" (= Nazification) the school closed in spring 1934. Zuckmayer changed to "<a href="Odenwaldschule">Odenwaldschule</a>", another progressive boarding school in <a href="Hesse">Hesse</a>. "Racial reasons" were mentioned when he became thrown out of "<a href="Reichsmusikkammer">Reichsmusikkammer</a>" (RMK) in 1935.

Turkey.
He had to leave Germany in 1936 and migrated to <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, where <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a> (1895–1963) was already busy reforming the Turkish music education, assigned by the Turkish president <a href="Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk">Kemal Atatürk</a>. Hindemith mediated Zuckmayer's employment at the newly founded <a href="Hacettepe%20University%20Ankara%20State%20Conservatory">Music Conservatory</a> of <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>. There he met German colleagues like stage director <a href="Carl%20Ebert">Carl Ebert</a> (1887–1980), conductor <a href="Ernst%20Praetorius">Ernst Praetorius</a> (1880–1946) or violinist <a href="Amar%20Quartet">Licco Amar</a> (1891–1959) and many others from German music and theatre who were forced to flee from Nazism.

Initially he led the pupil's orchestra of "Musiki Muallim Mektebi", where music teachers were trained. But in autumn of 1936 he got appointed as chorus leader of the drama play and opera division. He also became pianist of the "<a href="Presidential%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Ankara symphony orchestra</a>" conducted by Praetorius and was deputy of Hindemith.

In 1938 Gisela Jockisch (1905–1985), née Günther, followed him with her little daughter Melanie to Turkey. She was the wife of pedagogue Walter Jockisch (1907–1970). Jockisch and Zuckmayer had been colleagues at "Schule am Meer" on Juist Island. Gisela Jockisch and Eduard Zuckmayer lived together in Turkey but were not able to marry before 1947 because German authorities in 1938 neglected a certificate of no impediment to marriage ("Ehefähigkeitszeugnis") due to racist <a href="Nuremberg%20Laws">Nuremberg Laws</a> ("Nürnberger Gesetze").

In 1938 the academy "Gazi Egitim Enstitüsü" was founded. Zuckmayer became its director of the music division which he held until 1970. He gave distinction to the Turkish music pedagogy. Until 1970 he trained nearly all Turkish music teachers (about 600 in total) who later taught throughout the country. He integrated fundamentals of the German "Jugendmusikbewegung" into Turkish music pedagogy. One of his later well-known pupils was conductor <a href="Hikmet%20%C5%9Eim%C5%9Fek">Hikmet Şimşek</a>.

In 1940 his brother Carl wanted to help his brother to follow him to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> with an "<a href="affidavit%23United%20States">affidavit</a> of support" where he already had migrated. He was worried about his safety since German troops were fighting in close range to Turkey in <a href="Greece">Greece</a> as well as in southern regions of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. He contacted Hindemith in that matter.

In 1944 all German migrants were called upon by the Turkish government to leave Turkey. Eduard Zuckmayer refused ad got detained in <a href="K%C4%B1r%C5%9Fehir">Kırşehir</a> detainment camp in <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. Even there he very soon established a choir with whom he performed a mass by <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina</a> at <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> 1945. Hindemith who meanwhile had migrated to the US tried to intervene against Zuckmayer's detainment. He sent a telegram to Turkish president <a href="Ismet%20In%C3%B6n%C3%BC">Ismet Inönü</a> but it was not successful. After the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> Zuckmayer was able to leave the detainment camp and was reinstated to his former positions. He also taught music theory at <a href="Hacettepe%20University%20Ankara%20State%20Conservatory">Ankara Conservatory</a>.

Former <a href="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a> chairman <a href="Edzard%20Reuter">Edzard Reuter</a> who lived in Turkey at that time described Zuckmayer as a "dignified and quiet man" who extinguished a "unique atmosphere" when he "sat down to play the piano".
In 1947 he was finally able to marry his partner Gisela Jockisch. But in 1950 she left Turkey with his adopted daughter Michaela to remigrate to Germany. Later both migrated to the United States. Zuckmayer instead stayed at his place of activity. Even in old age he performed as concert pianist and conductor in Ankara, <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and <a href="Izmir">Izmir</a>.

He had internalised the Turkish language as rarely another migrant. Since his entry to Turkey he had plead for translation of German folk songs to Turkish language. Meanwhile, they were integrated into Turkish music schoolbooks. He also transmitted Turkish folk tunes to polyphonic choral singing.

In contrary to Germany where he is shadowed by his famous younger brother Eduard Zuckmayer still is a very prominent figure in Turkey. He is one of the most prominent protagonists of Turkish music history of the 20th century, especially in its national music education. On the occasion of his 20th obit in 1992 a conference was held in Ankara where some of his works were performed.

Zuckmayer died in the age of 81. His grave is in Ankara, Turkey.

He was a student at <a href="Trefeca">Trevecka</a> in 1843 and became minister in 1849 at Pontypridd's <a href="Peniel%20Chapel">Penuel chapel</a>. He moved to <a href="Bridgend">Ewenni Isaf</a> in 1852 and later Cardiff in 1864. From 1876-1883 he lived at <a href="Bonvilston">Bonvilston</a> but returned to <a href="Bridgend">Bridgend</a> before his death in 1892. 

Matthews gained a reputation as an imaginative and dramatic preacher, known for his sudden outcries. He has been deemed "the uncrowned king of the Calvinistic Methodist Associations".

Written works.
Edward Matthews published a volume of sermons in 1927, edited by D.M.Phillips. However, his most popular works were his biographies. "Hanes Bywyd Siencyn Penhydd," concerning the life of <a href="Jenkin%20Thomas%20%28Methodist%29">Jenkin Thomas</a>, was published in book form in 1850, "Bywgraffiad Thomas Richard" (on <a href="Thomas%20Richard%20%28Methodist%29">Thomas Richard</a>) in 1863 and "George Heycock a'i Amserau" in 1867"." He was also join author of "Cofiant J. Harris Jones" (on <a href="John%20Harris%20Jones">John Harris Jones</a>) in 1886 and edited two volumes each of Morgan Howells (in 1858 and 1869) and Thomas Richards (in 1866 and 1867). He often wrote articles for "Y Traethodydd, Y Drysorfa" and "Y Cylchgrawn," to the extent that W.Llywel Morgan edited a volume of Matthews' published articles in 1911.

Personal life.
Edward was born at New Barn near <a href="St%20Athan">St. Athan</a> to Thomas and Anne Matthews. As a child, his parents split and his father emigrated to the USA. In 1833, he lived in Glamorgan as a lodger to the widow Mrs.Truman at <a href="Penllyn%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan">Pen-llin</a>. He and Mrs. Truman married in 1843. Matthews is buried in Nolton churchyard.

Pain management in children

Pain management in children is the assessment and treatment of pain in <a href="infant">infant</a>s and <a href="child">child</a>ren. Pain has many different definitions. It is a sensation of anxiety, discomfort and distress. Physiologically, pain can be described in terms of nerve stimulation and conduction of nerve impulses to the brain. Such stimulation can mild, localized, chronic, acute or agonizing. Even in children, pain is tied to emotional and psychological components. The consequences of untreated pain can increase the incidence of complications and even death. Children can have significant pain related to <a href="Epidermolysis%20Bullosa">Epidermolysis Bullosa</a>, <a href="Osteogenesis%20Imperfecta">Osteogenesis Imperfecta</a>, cancer, metabolic/neurologic diseases, <a href="palliative%20care">palliative care</a>, and <a href="sickle%20cell%20disease">sickle cell disease</a>. One clinician has described the use of evidence-based approaches to managing pain in children: "Pain management practices should be based on scientific facts or agreed best practices, not on personal beliefs or opinion. The burden of proof lies with the healthcare professional, NOT the patient." The pain of many children is undertreated.

Indications.
The <a href="Indication%20%28medicine%29">indication</a>s for the treatment of pain in children are not always clear due to misconceptions that still exist. 
The indications for the treatment of pain can vary among health care providers and are subject to the provider's personalities, culture, and acceptance of pain in children. The characteristics of pain will help determine assessment, diagnosis and treatment. Pain can be acute, recurrent, chronic or a combination of these. The pain of children has been characterized as having "plasticity and complexity" and in need of timely and continuous assessment. A best practice is to ask for descriptions of the pain before querying the child about location, intensity, quality, and tolerance. Personal viewpoints and assumptions by providers regarding the meaning of a behavior need evaluation. There is "a relatively pervasive and systematic tendency for proxy judgments to underestimate the pain experience of others".

Minor invasive, and painful procedures often don't include a treatment plan for anticipated pain. During circumcision, infant boys do not consistently receive appropriate pain control. Newborn circumcisions are quite painful and associated with irritability and feeding disturbances for days after the procedure.
Acute pain.
Acute pain has an obvious cause and is expected only to last for a few days or weeks. It is usually managed with medication and then with non-pharmacological treats to provide comfort.

Acute pain is an indication for assessment, treatment and prevention. While in pain, physiological changes occur that can further jeopardize healing and recovery. Unrelieved pain can cause <a href="alkalosis">alkalosis</a> and <a href="hypoxemia">hypoxemia</a> that results from rapid, shallow breathing. The shallow breathing then leads to the accumulation of fluid in the lungs and the inability to cough can prevent the secretions from being expelled. The pain can cause an increase in blood pressure, heart rate creating great stress on the heart. Pain will increase the release anti-inflammatory steroids that will reduce the ability to fight infection. These same steroids that are released increase the metabolic rate and impact healing. Children experiencing pain have an increase in sympathetic effects such as the inability to urinate. The pain can also slow down the gastrointestinal system. This can result in the child receiving inadequate nutrition. Muscle cramps, stiffness, and stress prevents moving around, an essential activity in recovery.

Inadequate pain management in children can have psycho-social consequences. These can be a disinterest in food, apathy, sleep problems, anxiety, avoidance of subsequent discussions about health, fear, hopelessness and powerlessness. Other consequences can be longer hospital stays, high readmission rates and a longer recovery. On the other hand, the American Association of Pediatrics describes pain with immunizations as "The pain associated with the majority of immunizations is minor.".

Besides the obvious relief of suffering, managing pain in children will reduce the risk of later consequences due to unrelieved pain:

Pain can be caused by medical procedures. Acute pain can be expected in response to many if not most invasive procedures. Anticipation of pain and distress can guide the pre-treatment pain-prevention plan based upon past reports of pain associated with the procedure. Those with technical expertise and experience are most likely to minimize the pain as much as possible. Preparation before a procedure with information that can be understood by children and parents can minimize distress. Parents can benefit from advice regarding effective methods of comforting a child.

The type of procedure will determine the use of deep sedation and anesthesia. In some cases, the best methods to preventing and relieving pain will be building self-esteem. Other non-pharmacological treatments can be effective. These can be cognitive behavioral strategies, imagery, relaxation, massage, heat compression, calm adults, a quiet environment, and clear, confident explanations by providers. Some children benefit from the opportunity for self-regulation. Distress can be addressed and controlled. Such treatment plans have resulted in reductions of reports of pain and the assessed levels of pain in children. Pain reduction during invasive procedures is closely linked to controlling distress. Treating distress even for minor or uncomplicated procedures, likes venipuncture can be implemented.

Neuropathic pain.
<a href="Peripheral%20neuropathy">Neuropathic pain</a> is associated with nerve injuries or abnormal sensitivities to touch or contact. other causes are, postsurgical, post-amputation.

Cancer pain.
Cancer pain can differ from the other types of pain. In addition, a child can have pain for other reasons not associated with cancer. Pain in children without cancer can present as headaches, muscles strains and "as being part of being a child." Pain experienced by children is related to the stage or extent of the cancer. Children with cancer may have no pain. One child may have a different threshold for pain than another. Other sources of pain from cancer are:

Recurrent pain.
Recurrent pain is pain that arises periodically and can result in absences from school. This type of pain may be the most common. It is described as:


Chronic pain.
Chronic pain in children is unresolved pain that affects activities of daily living and may result in significant days lost at school. It is characterized as mild to severe and present for long periods of time. Chronic pain can develop from disease or injury with acute pain. Girls are more likely to have chronic pain. Some have described chronic pain as the pain experienced when the child reports: headache, abdominal pain, back pain, generalized pain or combinations of these. Children with chronic pain can have psychological effects. In addition, families may also suffer emotionally when the child experiences pain. Caring for a child in pain has social consequences related to the disability and limitations that acommpany the pain. Pain in children involves additional costs from healthcare and lost wages because time off from work is taken to care for the child.

Causes.
The causes of pain in infants and children are most likely to be the same as in adults. Pain be experienced in many ways and is dependent upon the child's:

Assessment.
Ongoing and frequent assessment between all those involved in the treatment plan is documented in a readily accessible format - usually the patient record. Assessment of the pain in children depends upon the cooperation and developmental stage of the child. Some children do not have the ability to assist in their assessment because they have matured enough cognitively, emotionally, or physically.

Young infant.
Signs of distress and possible pain are exhibited by young infants by:

Older infant.
Signs of distress and pain are exhibited in older infants by:

Toddler.
A toddler can express distress and pain by:

School-aged child.
School-aged children express pain in similar ways as toddlers but also by:

Adolescent.
Cultural expectations begin to influence expressions of pain. Adolescents express pain:

Quantitative pain assessment.
Though pain is subjective and can be considered to exist as a spectrum rather than an exact determination, different assessment tools exist to compare pain levels over time. This kind of assessment incorporates pain scales and requires a high enough developmental level so that the child can respond to the question(s). A verbal response is not always necessary to quantify the pain.

Pain scales.
A <a href="pain%20scale">pain scale</a> measures a <a href="patient">patient</a>'s <a href="pain">pain</a> intensity or other features. Pain scales are based on self-report, observational (behavioral), or physiological data. Self-report is considered primary and should be obtained if possible. Pain measurements help determine the severity, type, and duration of the pain, and are used to make an accurate diagnosis, determine a treatment plan, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. Pain scales are available for neonates, infants, children, adolescents, adults, seniors, and persons whose communication is impaired. Pain assessments are often regarded as "the 5th <a href="Vital%20signs">Vital Sign</a>".

During treatment.
Clinicians responsible for the child monitor the child frequently in tertiary care centers (hospitals). Pharmacological and non-pharmacological or both treatment modalities are used to manage the pain. Parents or caregivers are also requested to provide their own pain assessments. At the beginning of pharmacological treatment, clinicians monitor the child for adverse reactions to the medications. The levels of some medications are monitored to ensure that the child is not over medicated or receives toxic levels of the drug. The levels will also provide the results that will indicate that the levels in the blood are high enough to be effective in managing the pain. Medications are metabolized differently between even children of the same age. The factors that influence the levels of medications that control pain are the height, weight, and body surface of the child in addition to any other illnesses that a child might have. Some medications may have a <a href="paradoxical%20effect">paradoxical effect</a> in children, that is, an effect that is the opposite of the expected effect. Clinicians monitor for this and any other reactions to the medication.

Because children process information differently than adults, a-traumatic measures are used to reduce anxiety and stress. Treatment centers for children often employ these procedures. Examples are:

Non-pharmacological pain management.
Pain relieving, non pharmacological management of pain during immunizations can be sugar on a pacifier, comforting during and after the injections, visualization of 'blowing away the pain' (like bubbles), chest to chest hugging, and giving the child choices about injection sites. Other non-pharmacological treaments that have been found to be effective:

Pharmacotherapy.
The use of medications to treat acute, chronic, recurrent and neuropathic pain is most common. Most instances of pain in children are treated with <a href="analgesic">analgesic</a>s. These include <a href="acetaminophen">acetaminophen</a>, <a href="NSAIDs">NSAIDs</a>, local anesthetics, <a href="opioid">opioid</a>s, and medications for <a href="neuropathic%20pain">neuropathic pain</a>. The most effective approach to pain management in children is to provide round the clock instead of providing pain relief as needed. Regional anesthesia is effective and recommended whenever possible. Opioids are effective but depress breathing in infants.

Chronic pain treatment.
Chronic pain is treated with a variety of medications and non-pharmacological interventions. Opioid tolerance and withdrawal can be seen in the NICU and PICU. Other side effects with opioid use can be: cognition deficets, altered mood, and disturbances of endocrine development. Opioid misuse can occur in adolescents and is associated with the use of alcohol, cigarettes and marijuana.

Non-pharmacological treatment for children in helping to relieve periodic pain episodes and severity includes counselling and behavior modification therapy. The American Association of Pediatrics have suggested that parents be educated on providing round the clock medication administration after their children receive surgery.

Acute pain treatment.
For acute pain, multiple medications given at the same time is the most effective. This results in lower pain scores, provides greater relief, allows lower dosing (and side effects), targets different nerve pathways, and can be tailored to the child.

Cancer pain treatment.
Cancer pain in children is managed differently in children. Clinicians treating the pain can come from a variety of disciplines or specialities. The medical history, physical examinations, age and overall health of the child is evaluated. The type of cancer may influence decisions about pain management. The extent of the cancer, the tolerance of the child to specific medications, procedure or therapies is also taken into account. The preferences of the parent or caregiver is also part of determining the best way to treat cancer pain in the child. For cancer pain, opioids are effective. The side effects can be: constipation, fatigue, and disorientation. Some opioids can be given orally. Others are given IV, subcutaneous, or transdermal. Switching medications may be necessary. Dosing for children has been based upon studies with adults or short-term studies. Children can develop opioid tolerance where larger doses are needed to have the same effect. When resistance to opioids develop, the pain responsiveness is reset and everything hurts more. Tolerance is more likely to develop in younger children.

History.
In the recent past it was believed that the experssions of pain in babies was <a href="reflex">reflex</a>ive and due to the immaturity of the infant <a href="brain">brain</a>, the pain could not really be perceived. Attempting to relieve pain in infants was considered futile since it was thought to be impossible to measure the child's pain.

These beliefs along with cultural concerns of opiate addiction contributed to the clinicians of the time withholding pain relief.

In 1994, responding to the need for a more useful system for describing <a href="chronic%20pain">chronic pain</a>, the <a href="International%20Association%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Pain">International Association for the Study of Pain</a> (IASP) classified pain by the:

N-day period

An “"n"-day period” is a period of "n" consecutive <a href="day">day</a>s, where "n" is some positive <a href="integer">integer</a>. For example, when "n" = 12, then it is a 12-day period. Appropriate calculation methods for finding the number of days when given the starting and ending date differ according to the case under consideration even if it is a　familiar problem. In some cases, it may also be necessary to take into account such things as “<a href="business%20day">business day</a>s”, “<a href="holiday">holiday</a>s,” etc. In cases where provisions stipulated by <a href="laws">laws</a> or judicial precedents need to be considered, multiple calculation methods may exist, and this situation may lead to lawsuits in some cases.

Calculating the number of days in arithmetic.
The calculation method of ""n"-day period" is strongly related to the definition of “"n" days later” and “"n" days before”. So, we started this section from the introduction of the definition of “"n" days later” and “"n" days before”.

The definition of “"n" days later” and “"n" days before”.
There are some different and unequal definitions for “"n" days later” and “"n" days before”. However, since calculation conventions for them are not the subject of this article, the following definitions are adopted for the purpose of this article.

Examples:

Day count conventions in arithmetic.
There are three primitive different and unequal methods of calculating the number of days between two specific dates as shown below. Even cases that require consideration of provisions by laws and judicial precedents will come down to the combination of the following primitive calculation methods and how to divide cases after all (though it may be concluded that multiple interpretations are possible.)

So, the relation of above-mentioned primitive methods is represented by following equation.
Extending calendar.
Extending calendar is a virtual calendar using "extending the days of the month", that is dates after the number of the days of the next month to be counted is added to the number of the days of the months to be counted. It will be useful to calculate if the period extends long teams. The definitions of the "extending the days" are as follows. Extending calendar is familiarly known as "お化け日暦(Obake Hireki)" in Japan.

Following equations are satisfied.
Examples: 




Advanced examples.
In this section, we exemplify describe the calculation method, when the start date and the end date belong to different months.

Église Saint-Benoît-le-Bétourné

The Église Saint-Benoît-le-Bétourné was a church in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. Originally dedicated to the martyrs <a href="Sergius%20and%20Bacchus">Sergius and Bacchus</a>, it was founded in the 6th century on <a href="Rue%20Saint-Jacques%20%28Paris%29">rue Saint-Jacques</a> in what is now the <a href="5th%20arrondissement%20of%20Paris">5th arrondissement of Paris</a>. It was demolished in 1831 to build the <a href="th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20du%20Panth%C3%A9on">théâtre du Panthéon</a>, which was itself demolished in 1854 to build <a href="Rue%20des%20%C3%89coles%20%28Paris%29">rue des Écoles</a>.

History.
According to Raoul of Presles the church was founded by <a href="Denis%20of%20Paris">Denis of Paris</a>, who carried his head to its site after his execution, blessing the location, preaching a sermon on the <a href="Holy%20Trinity">Holy Trinity</a> and dedicating it to "Benoît Sire Dieu" ("Blessed be the Lord our God"). Its spelling changed over the centuries and so the church's dedication seems to have shifted to <a href="Benedict%20of%20Nursia">Benedict (in French "Benoît") of Nursia</a>.

Traditionally the church's master builder mistakenly added its choir to the west end not the east, leading to its nickname of "le bétourné" ("the [church] turned the wrong way round"). Around 1280-1300 it is mentioned in "<a href="Le%20Dit%20des%20rues%20de%20Paris">Le Dit des rues de Paris</a>" by <a href="Guillot%20de%20Paris">Guillot de Paris</a> as Saint-Beneoit le bestourné. <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a> restored its usual name early in the 16th century and it then took the nickname "le bistourné" ("the twice-turned [church]"), later bowdlerised into "le bestourné", possibly to bring it back closer to its old name.

One of the church's chaplains was Guillaume de Villon, tutor to <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Villon">François Villon</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Perrault">Charles Perrault</a> was buried in the church. In the Middle Ages the church housed an altar of <a href="Maturinus">Maturinus</a>, patron of the mad and possessed, around which a devotion to him sprang up and to which many ill people were brought in hope of a cure. 

During the reign of <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a>, the church's cloister housed a public market. He also granted the canons of <a href="Notre%20Dame%20de%20Paris">Notre Dame de Paris</a> a right to sell bread and wine in that market. The cloister's vast barns allowed the canons to store the grain and wine paid as dues to the canons. The church and its land were sold on 5 October 1791, 8 October 1791 and 30 September 1798. and in 1790 the revolutionary authorities turned it into a store for horse fodder. It was destroyed in 1854 to build rue des Écoles.

<doc id="54904838" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54904838" title="Chronic fatigue syndrome in children">
Chronic fatigue syndrome in children

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome in children is a lingering and debilitating illness that produces a variety of debilitating effects in children and adolescents. The major findings and characteristics of this disease is fatigue, body, muscle pain, joint pain, cognitive deficits, disturbed sleep, and headaches. As in adults, there is no cure or approved treatment for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) in children. However, some symptoms can be treated or managed. Treating these symptoms might provide relief for some patients with ME/CFS but not others. Other strategies, like learning new ways to manage activity, can also be helpful.

Patients, their families, and healthcare providers need to work together to decide which symptom causes the most problems. They should discuss the possible benefits and harms of any treatment plans, including medicines and other therapies. A treatment plan for a child who might have ME/CFS should focus on the most disruptive symptoms first.

Symptoms.
Pain can be significant. Children with ME/CFS often have headaches and stomach pains. Food allergies and vision problems can contribute to the pain.

Lightheadedness.
Some children and adolescents with ME/CFS might also have symptoms of orthostatic intolerance that are triggered when-or made worse by-standing or sitting upright. These symptoms can include:


For patients with these symptoms, their doctor will check their heart rate and blood pressure, and may recommend they see a specialist, like a cardiologist or neurologist. For children with ME/CFS who do not have heart or blood vessel disease, their doctor might suggest patients increase daily fluid and salt intake and use support stockings. If symptoms do not improve, prescription medication can be considered.

Sleep problems.
Children might continue to feel unrefreshed even after the medications help them to get a full night of sleep. If so, they should consider seeing a sleep specialist. Most people with sleep disorders, like sleep apnea (brief pause in breathing during sleep) and narcolepsy (uncontrollable sleeping), respond to therapy. However, for children with ME/CFS, not all symptoms may go away.

Problems with concentation.
Children with ME/CFS may have problems paying attention, thinking, remembering, and responding. For instance, after becoming ill it may be hard for children to take notes and listen to their teacher at the same time.

Depression, stress, and anxiety.
Adjusting to any chronic illness can sometimes lead to symptoms of depression and anxiety. Anxiety in children with ME/CFS is not caused by the illness itself. It can happen because of the changes the child must make to live with the illness. When healthcare providers are concerned about a patient’s psychological condition, they may recommend seeing a mental health professional.

Treatment.
Pain can be relieved for some by gentle massage and heat. Parents/guardians should always talk to their child’s healthcare provider before trying any medication. Doctors may recommend trying over-the-counter pain-relievers, like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

Sleep problems.
Good sleep habits are important for all people, including those with ME/CFS. Some common tips for good sleep are:

When children try these techniques but are still unable to sleep, their doctor might recommend taking medicine to help with sleep.

Inability to concentrate, think, and remember.
For children with ME/CFS who have concentration problems, some doctors have prescribed stimulant medications, like those typically used to treat Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). While stimulants might help improve concentration for some patients with ME/CFS, they might lead to the “push-and-crash” cycle and worsen symptoms. “Push-and-crash” cycles are when someone with ME/CFS is having a good day and tries to push to do more than they would normally attempt (do too much, crash, rest, start to feel a little better, do too much once again).

Depression, stress, and anxiety.
Counseling may help to reduce stress and some symptoms of depression and anxiety, like sleep problems and headaches. Some children might benefit from antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications. However, doctors should use caution in prescribing these medications. Some drugs used to treat depression have other effects that might worsen other ME/CFS symptoms and cause side effects. Some children with ME/CFS might benefit from trying techniques like deep breathing and muscle relaxation, massage, and movement therapies (like stretching, yoga, and tai chi). These can reduce stress and anxiety, and promote a sense of well-being. Although treating depression and anxiety can ease mental and emotional distress in some patients and can be very beneficial, it is not a cure for ME/CFS.

Activity.
For patients with ME/CFS, it is important to find a balance between inactivity and excessive activity, which can make symptoms worse. This means a new way of thinking about daily activities. For example, daily chores and school activities may need to be broken down into smaller steps. A symptom diary can be very helpful for managing ME/CFS. Keeping daily track of how patients feel and what patients do may help to find ways to make activities easier. Parents/guardians and doctors of children with ME/CFS can work with teachers and school administrators to adjust the school load for children with ME/CFS.

It was established as a branch of the <a href="Lead%20Development%20Association">Lead Development Association</a> in London in 1982, and is the largest organisation in the world dedicated to electric boats and boating 

It was the first such national association, others followed in France Australia, The Netherlands, the USA and Greece 

Governance and organisation.
The EBA is constituted as a member-led, not-for-profit unincorporated body, with a membership that fluctuates annually between 3-400 individual and business members. Members elect the Office Bearers at the AGM.

Aims and activities.
The association aims to generate the revival of electric boats, including innovation in both engineering and battery technology, lower wash hull design, alongside the setting up of an infrastructure of charging points hand-in-hand with the reduction of licence fees and a regular participation in both boat shows and rallies on the Thames, Norfolk, the Lake District and elsewhere.

Publications.
The EBA members magazine “Electric Boat News”, has progressed to a full colour magazine and recently an online magazine. The EBA also publishes a Business Member's Directory & Product Guide Trade. Social media pages have also become important means of communication in recent years.

Challenges and Records.
The Electric Boat Association promotes and encourages competitions and challenges. The Solar Challenge Trophy was first established in 1997 and awarded that year to Malcolm Moss for his solar-powered channel crossing. The St David's Trophy was donated by the former speedboat racing champion, the late <a href="Fiona%2C%20Dowager%20Countess%20of%20Arran">Fiona, Dowager Countess of Arran</a>. The silver cup is awarded for "significant advance in the field of electric boating". <a href="Rear-Admiral%20Percy%20Gick">Rear-Admiral Percy Gick</a> presented the Emsworth Trophy to the Association in commemoration of the 600 mile cruise the Admiral and Mrs Gick made in 1978 in their cruiser "Electra of Emsworth". It is a great-crested grebe (the EBA symbol) in limewood carved and painted by Captain John Powell of Emsworth.

The Emsworth Trophy is awarded to the EBA member whose boat completed the longest journey achieved during any consecutive four-month period in accordance with rules laid down and as determined by the committee. Mansura Perpetual Challenge Trophy, launched in February 2007, is for innovation in the design, development and operation of boats with hybrid or all electric propulsion systems. The bronze trophy, depicting the tiller head of the 1912 hybrid motor yacht Mansura, was donated by Julian Delmar-Morgan, grandson of the yacht's designer and owner, and David Barratt.

Over the 2015 August Bank holiday weekend, Les Fidler of Westview Marina Earith achieved his personal challenge of cruising from Bedford to Denver Sluice (then the return trip to [Earith] ), a distance of over 100 miles on one charge. Annie, Les and Elaine Fidler’s 27 ft cruiser has solar panels fitted to the roof to assist charging but the weather for most of the weekend included torrential rain and very little sun to be seen.

In July 1997, 24 hour Endurance Record was set by EBA members Pat and Paul Wagstaffe M.B.E. in their 29 ft launch ‘Wagtail V’. Organised by EBA business member Thames Electric Launch Company, the record was established covering 116 miles in 24 hours on a single charge over a measured stretch of the River Thames near Goring. Four years later, Richard and Anne Leeson, EBA members, offered their classic 1899 Andrews river launch ‘Pike’ for an Endurance Record attempt. Conducted in co-operation with the Guinness Book of Records, the record attempt was carried out over the same stretch of the Thames used in 1997 but this time the run lasted for 30 hours and covered 137 miles on a single charge.

In the later periods, the term was used to refer to a peasant settlement without a church around a landowner's estate.

2017 Corruption cases involving prominent Israeli political figures

Throughout the course of 2017, several corruption scandals have been raised in regards to top <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i political officials. The investigations involve prominent Israeli businessmen, ministers, journalists, and current <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Israel">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. The first of the investigations, dubbed "Case 1000" opened officially in December 2016. This investigations looked into valuable presents and gifts received by Netanyahu, and his family throughout the years from several known wealthy acquaintances of the family. "Case 2000" deals with recorded conversations PM Netanyahu had with the publisher of <a href="Yedioth%20Ahronoth">Yedioth Ahronoth</a>, one of the largest newspapers in circulation in Israel. During these conversations Netanyahu is believed to have proposed to push legislation harming Yedioth's major competitor, <a href="Israel%20Hayom">Israel Hayom</a>, in exchange for more flattering and positive coverage of himself in Yedioth. "Case 3000" does not directly involve Netanyahu, as it involves a list of busniness men, lawyers, and officials in the security organizations in Israel, and their connection to a deal made between Israel and <a href="Germany">Germany</a> in what may be a bribed deal, buying several submarines. "Case 4000" regards dealings with the Israeli company <a href="Bezeq">Bezeq</a>. PM <a href="Benjamin%20Netanyahu">Netanyahu</a> is a suspect in Case 1000 and Case 2000, although not in Case 3000 or 4000.

Several events have followed the investigations as they had widespread implications, each saturday protesters gathered in <a href="Petah%20Tikva">Petah Tikva</a> to protest what they claim as inefficient dealings with the investigations by the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Israel">Attorney General</a> <a href="Avichai%20Mandelblit">Avichai Mandelblit</a><a href="https%3A//www.ynetnews.com/articles/0%2C7340%2CL-5001845%2C00.html">1</a>. After many weeks of one sided protests, in recent weeks supporters of Netanyahu (mainly <a href="Likud">Likud</a> party members) organized counter protests. In early August 2017, leader of the coalition <a href="David%20Bitan">David Bitan</a> began calling to arms the members of the Likud party, first in the form of the counter protests in Petach Tikva, later by threatening any party member who won't stand behind Netanyahu of "getting even" in the next primary season, and finally in a large rally to show support. The rally was held in <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> and had a wide showing of the majority of the <a href="Knesset">Knesset</a> members from the Likud party. During the rally Netanyahu gave a controversial speech, accusing the media of being a part of a left wing coalition and plotting against not only him, but the entire right wing. Opponents of Netanyahu argued that this was baseless, first because he is being investigated personally, as opposed to the entire Likud party, and because both <a href="Roni%20Alsheikh">Roni Alsheikh</a> (Chief of the Israeli Police) and Attorney General <a href="Avichai%20Mandelblit">Avichai Mandelblit</a> were appointed by Netanyahu himself <a href="http%3A//abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-rally-israels-netanyahu-lashes-media-49117797">2</a>.

Case 1000.
Netanyahu is currently being investigated for receiving valuable gifts from several billionaires, most notably <a href="James%20Packer">James Packer</a>, and <a href="Arnon%20Milchan">Arnon Milchan</a>. The investigation centers around expensive cigars, champagne, and jewelry for Netanyahu's wife <a href="Sara%20Netanyahu">Sara</a> costing hundreds of thousands of <a href="New%20Israeli%20shekel">shekels</a>. The family's claim is that these were justified gifts between friends. The police is investigation if anything was given in exchange for these gifts.

Case 2000.
The two largest newspapers in circulation in Israel are: <a href="Yedioth%20Ahronoth">Yedioth Ahronoth</a>, and <a href="Israel%20Hayom">Israel Hayom</a>. Israel Hayom is owned (either directly or indirectly) by <a href="Sheldon%20Adelson">Sheldon Adelson</a>, a personal friend and benefactor of Netanyahu. Given this relationship Israel Hayom isoften criticized by the political left saying that the newspaper is biased and portrays Netanyahu is an often unfairly positive light. Meanwhile, Yedioth is considered to not be politaclly affiliated with Netanyahu, and him and his cabinet members have often critizised the paper's journalists of being unfairly negative of Netanyahu. Netanyahu and the Editor of Yedioth, Arnon "Noni" Moses held recorded conversations between the two of them, with Netanyahu offering to push legislation that would harm Yedioth's main competitor, Israel Yahom. In turn Moses would hire journalists more to Netanyahu's liking, who would steer the general stance of the paper to one that is more favorable to Netanyahu.

Case 3000.
A number of submarines were purchased from the German company <a href="ThyssenKrupp">ThyssenKrupp</a> by Israel. The suspicion in this case refers to swaying the deal in ThyssenKrup's favor for the personal gain of several of the people involved. Netanyahu is not a suspect in Case 3000, though his cousin and personal lawyer David Shimron, who also represented the German company is Israel is one of the main suspects.

Case 4000.
Case 4000 involves the communication conglomerate <a href="Bezeq">Bezeq</a>. The investigation is checking whether there were relations between members of Netanyahu's staff and high end officials at Bezeq, and if there were falsehoods in regards to paperwork leading to favorable business dealings with said officials.

Min Hogg

Min Hogg is a British journalist, magazine editor, and interior designer. She was the fashion editor of "<a href="Harper%27s%20%26amp%3B%20Queen">Harper's & Queen</a>" between 1974 and 1979, and then co-founded the "<a href="World%20of%20Interiors">World of Interiors</a>" in 1981, which became one of the most influential <a href="shelter%20magazine">shelter magazine</a>s of the late 20th century.

Early life.
Georgina Hogg was born in London in 1939, and grew up in <a href="Regent%27s%20Park">Regent's Park</a>. Her father was a personal physican to <a href="Elizabeth%20II">the Queen</a>, with a surgery on <a href="Harley%20Street">Harley Street</a>. She attended boarding school in <a href="Benenden">Benenden</a>, and then went to the Central School of Art to study graphic design with <a href="Terence%20Conran">Terence Conran</a>. Hogg was one of the girlfriends of <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a>, with his daughter <a href="Anjelica%20Huston">Anjelica</a> recalling how Hogg helped her practise her modelling walk by lending her her heels and stockings to practice in.

Career.
Conran's wife, Caroline, who was already working at "<a href="Queen%20%28magazine%29">Queen</a>", asked Hogg to come and join the magazine as a typist. This was her first job, introducing Hogg to journalism as a career. Hogg briefly left to write for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" on interior decor and architecture, and was also a photographer's agent for a while, but in 1974, returned to the team of "Queen" (now rechristened "<a href="Harpers%20%26amp%3B%20Queen">Harpers & Queen</a>") as a fashion editor. Hogg wrote for She eventually succeeded <a href="Jennifer%20Hocking">Jennifer Hocking</a> as chief fashion editor, much to the frustration of Hocking's assistant, <a href="Anna%20Wintour">Anna Wintour</a>, who had wanted the role. However, <a href="Willie%20Landels">Willie Landels</a>, the editor of Harper & Queen, stated that he employed Hogg because she was intelligent and articulate, and unusually for a fashion editor at the time, was able to both speak well and write well. Hogg stayed on at "Harper & Queen" until 1979. She then went on to become fashion editor for "Sheba", an Arabic-language magazine aimed towards the wives of Middle-Eastern oil barons.

Hogg was founding editor of "World of Interiors", and held the role for 20 years from 1981 to 2001. The magazine, originally titled "Interiors", proved so successful that within six months of its launch in November 1981, <a href="Cond%C3%A9%20Nast">Condé Nast</a> made an offer to purchase it. In June 1982, Condé Nast eventually purchased a half-interest, and the magazine was renamed "World of Interiors" to avoid conflict with another American magazine also called "Interiors". Whilst Condé Nast already owned a similarly conceived publication, "<a href="House%20%26amp%3B%20Garden%20%28magazine%29">House & Garden</a>", the company felt that "World of Interiors" offered an exclusive up-market image to appeal to those seeking escapism and fantasy, whilst "House & Garden" was more accessible and that the titles would be complementary, rather than rivals. By December 1983, "World of Interiors" had a circulation of 52,000 issues per month, with 7,000 per month in the United States and many notable subscriptors including <a href="Jacqueline%20Onassis">Jacqueline Onassis</a>, <a href="Paloma%20Picasso">Paloma Picasso</a>, and <a href="Bill%20Blass">Bill Blass</a>. In 1983 alone, the advertising revenues had risen by 68 percent from 1982.

Under Hogg's direction, the magazine promoted interiors that used historical textiles and artefacts to create a romantic and rarefied effect, although she stated that she was simply doing whatever pleased her. In 1983 she described her approach as celebrating homes personalised by their residents, rather than interiors created by professional decorators, and stated that she wanted to promote eclecticism, vintage style, and individualism, and not <a href="modernism">modernism</a> or <a href="minimalism">minimalism</a>. In June 1999, the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>" commented that Hogg's 18 years in the post made her a typical example of the longevity of Condé Nast's editors.

Later life.
Hogg continues travelling in pursuit of inspiration, with homes in London and the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>. As of 2017 she works as a wallpaper designer in collaboration with <a href="Nicholas%20Haslam">Nicholas Haslam</a>.

In April 1839 Nezel handed the theatre over to one of his troupe, Dubourjal, who took on <a href="Aline%20Duval">Aline Duval</a>, who had jumped ship from the <a href="th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20Comte">théâtre Comte</a> - she was so successful that she was in turn taken on by the manager of the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20du%20Palais-Royal">Palais-Royal</a>. After a financial dispute, Dubourjal was dismissed in April 1841 by the theatre's owner.

In September the actor Oscar Pichat was made the theatre's manager, but he resigned in February 1842, to be replaced by its owner Houy, who then managed it until April 1843. Its last two managers, Blachard and Braux, were also actors - they made one final attempt to revive the theatre's fortunes in September 1843, but in vain. On their departure, the government revoked the theatre's licence and closed it permanently. The building was finally demolished in 1854 to build <a href="rue%20des%20%C3%89coles%20%28Paris%29">rue des Écoles</a>.

Uroczysko Baran killing fields

The Uroczysko Baran killing fields (), often referred to in Poland as the "Little <a href="Katyn%20massacre">Katyn</a>" or the "Second Katyn", is the location of secret executions of soldiers and officers of the <a href="Polish%20Underground%20State">Polish Underground State</a> carried out by the communist forces on behalf of <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a>, <a href="SMERSH">SMERSH</a>, <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Poland%29">PUBP</a>, and (the Soviet-formed) <a href="Second%20Army%20%28Poland%29">Second Army</a> of <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Army">Ludowe Wojsko Polskie</a> in the later stages of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. 

The killing fields at the Uroczysko Baran – also known as the Baran Forest ("baran" means "<a href="sheep">ram</a>" in Polish) , are located on the outskirts of <a href="K%C4%85kolewnica">Kąkolewnica</a> village <a href="Lublin%20Voivodeship">in eastern Poland</a>, near <a href="Radzy%C5%84%20Podlaski">Radzyń Podlaski</a>. It is estimated that up to 1,200 or 1,800 wartime members of the <a href="Home%20Army">Home Army</a> (AK), <a href="Freedom%20and%20Independence">Freedom and Independence</a> (WiN), the Agrarian Battalions of <a href="Bataliony%20Ch%C5%82opskie">BCh</a>, as well as Polish defectors drafted to the communist armies, and alleged <a href="enemies%20of%20the%20people">enemies of the people</a>, have been murdered there over execution pits, from late autumn 1944 until February 1945, with hands tied in the back. The forensic examination of twelve exhumed bodies revealed multiple bone fractures: broken hands, limbs, hips, and cracked skulls indicating extreme beatings in detention, before executions. President of Poland <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Komorowski">Bronisław Komorowski</a> came to Uroczysko Baran on June 20, 2013, for a solemn ceremony of laying flowers and wreaths at the monument. The killings are a subject of scholarly monograph published in 2007 by Jan Kołkowicz in the Polish language.

History.
The killing fields were known to the local people in Kąkolewnica since the beginning. In July 1944 the Soviet <a href="1st%20Belorussian%20Front">1st Belorussian Front</a> under Marshal <a href="Konstantin%20Rokossovsky">Konstantin Rokossovsky</a> stationed in Kąkolewnica, taking away cattle and plundering food supplies, throwing people out of their homes for military lodgings, and setting up SMERSH and NKVD interrogation dungeons in the basements. Soon, General Świerczewski with his LWP soldiers joined the fray. The Polish partisans from AK, WiN and BCh, caught in the vicinity – but also transported there from afar – like the soldiers of the <a href="27th%20Home%20Army%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Poland%29">27th Home Army Infantry Division</a>, were executed across the vast area of the forest spanning well over a dozen <a href="hectare">hectare</a>s. Mass graves were planted over with small pine trees by the killers. A symbolic cross was erected on site by some people in the summer of 1945. Removed by the communist officials, it was often replaced by the locals under the cover of night. 

The number of people murdered at Uroczysko Baran is not known. Even the number of mass graves has not been established to this day. After fifty years of communist rule in Poland, the closely guarded site is now overgrown with mature trees. Partial documents found in the archives of the Polish Army prove only 43 official executions, and 144 military court convictions, but the Soviet archives are either inaccessible, or no longer existing. Soon after the end of totalitarianism in Poland, the <a href="Institute%20of%20National%20Remembrance">Institute of National Remembrance</a> interviewed 110 witnesses. There was only one forensic exhumation conducted at Uroczysko Baran. The human remains were reburied at a local cemetery in Kąkolewnica in 1990. The IPN branch in Lublin informs that some 2,000 <a href="Anti-communist%20resistance%20in%20Poland%20%281944%E2%80%9346%29">anti-communist resistance fighters</a> have been detained in local prisons by the <a href="History%20of%20Poland%20%281945%E2%80%931989%29">Stalinist security forces</a> between 1944 and 1956, including 450 most prominent <a href="cursed%20soldiers">cursed soldiers</a>.

<a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Franczak">Józef Franczak</a> witnessed some of the killings. After the Soviet troops entered the area, he was conscripted into the Polish communist 2nd Army stationing in Kąkolewnica, where the military court was located. Franczak deserted in January 1945 and became a cursed soldier. He was shot dead in 1963. At Kąkolewnica, and at the Uroczysko Baran, hundreds of detainees died without a trial. According to witnesses, military trucks covered with tarpaulin travelled back and forth between the two locations until November 1945, day in and day out.

<doc id="54905604" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54905604" title="Oregon black exclusion laws">
Oregon black exclusion laws

The Oregon black exclusion laws were attempts to prevent blacks from settling within the borders of the settlement and eventual US state of Oregon. The first such law took effect in 1844, when the <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20Oregon">Provisional Government of Oregon</a> voted to exclude all black settlers from Oregon's borders. The law authorized a punishment for any black settler remaining in the territory to be whipped with "not less than twenty nor more than thirty-nine stripes" for every six months they remained. Additional laws aimed at African Americans entering Oregon were ratified in 1849 and 1857. The last of these laws was repealed in 1926. The laws, born of anti-slavery and anti-black beliefs, were often justified as a reaction to fears of blacks instigating Native American uprisings.

Timeline.
Early white settlers in <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> often held both anti-slavery and anti-black beliefs, and many came from states, such as <a href="History%20of%20slavery%20in%20Missouri">Missouri</a>, which had some version of exclusion laws. White settlers believed banning slavery would eliminate political controversy, but feared that settlements of freed slaves would compete for power with whites. One early migrant wrote that Oregon pioneers "hated slavery, but a much larger number of them hated free negroes worse even than slaves.”

In 1843, the Provisional Government of Oregon established a set of <a href="Organic%20Laws%20of%20Oregon">organic laws</a>, including a ban on <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>: "There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." Enforcement of the law was left unclear. After a vote on June 26, 1844, the first Black Exclusion law reiterated a ban on all slavery in Oregon territory, while also forcing blacks and <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a> settlers to leave Oregon territory within three years (two years for men), or else to be whipped "no more than 39 times." This section was amended in December 1844 to permit a <a href="Freedman">free slave</a> to be resold on the condition that the slave owner agree to remove them from the territory at the end of the contract, which was held with the provisional government. In effect, this re-established slavery on a temporary basis for three years. The law was repealed in 1845, having never been invoked.

On September 21, 1849, the US territory established its second exclusion law, declaring a ban on "any negro or mulatto to enter into, or reside" in Oregon unless already established there. At least four blacks were punished under this law, including <a href="Jacob%20Vanderpool">Jacob Vanderpool</a>, a sailor, and three others who were eventually permitted to stay.

An 1850 census showed fewer than 50 black residents in the state of Oregon, including a mixed-race man from Pennsylvania, <a href="George%20Washington%20Bush">George Washington Bush</a>, who was forced to move North of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> after the first exclusion Law was passed. George Washington, another unrelated free man, was the founder of <a href="Centralia%2C%20Washington">Centralia</a>, Washington. 

On April 16, 1852, <a href="Robin%20Holmes">Robin Holmes</a>, a black slave of <a href="Nathaniel%20Ford">Nathaniel Ford</a>, brought a case to the <a href="Oregon%20Supreme%20Court">territorial Supreme Court</a>, charging that he and his family were being held by Ford illegally. <a href="Holmes%20v.%20Ford">Holmes v. Ford</a> was heard by four judges, culminating in Judge George H. Williams' June 1853 ruling that slavery was illegal in Oregon. Descendants of Holmes have since stated that Ford had encouraged the lawsuit as a means to bring an end to slavery in the state.

On November 7, 1857, Oregon's delegates to the state <a href="Oregon%20Constitutional%20Convention">Constitutional Convention</a> submitted proposals to legalize slavery and to ban blacks from the state, including a ban on signing contracts or owning land. The slavery amendment failed, but the exclusion law passed. Oregon was the only state admitted to the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> with such an exclusion law. There are no records that this law was enforced, and the legislature voted down a proposed 1865 law that would authorize sheriffs to deport black residents in their counties.

1844 law and amendments.
The <a href="Cockstock%20Incident">Cockstock Incident</a> was a major factor in the passage of the first black exclusion law. It centered on a fight between a <a href="Wasco-Wishram">Wasco</a> Native American man, Cockstock, and a free black man, James D. Saules, over ownership of a horse. The argument escalated into a melee that killed three men, and led to rhetoric among white settlers that African-Americans could create an uprising among local <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> tribes against settlers.

On June 24, 1844, within days of the Cockstock Incident, the <a href="Provisional%20Legislature%20of%20Oregon">Oregon Provisional Legislature</a> suspended its rules to allow <a href="Peter%20Hardeman%20Burnett">Peter Burnett</a> to propose a bill "for the prevention of slavery" without reference to a committee. The bill was read twice and voted into law the following day. The bill contained methods of enforcement for the prevention of slavery, which had already been banned in the territory. These laws included a three year limit on all free blacks, and required freed slaves to leave the state within two years, if male, and three years, if female. The initial law proposed "no more than 20" lashings by whip for slaves found in violation of the law, which was amended in December 1844. A week after the law's passage, Burnett wrote in a personal letter that the bill was intended to "keep clear of that most troublesome class of population." 

Decades later, Burnett publicly described the Exclusion Law was intended to prevent disenfranchised blacks from being exposed to politically empowered whites, which he wrote "reminds them of their inferiority," and suggested that their presence was "injurious to the dominant class itself, as such a degraded and practically defenseless condition offers so many temptations to tyrannical abuse."

Text of 1844 law and amendments.
Though the official text of the original law has been lost, it was reprinted in several sources at the time. The law as described contained eight sections, and two amendments were added in December 1844. The Oregon exclusion law prohibited free black men and women in the territory, though jurisdiction for the law was limited to the region south of the Columbia river.

Section 1.
That slavery and involuntary servitude shall be forever prohibited in Oregon. 

Section 2.
That in all cases where slaves shall have been, or shall hereafter be, brought into Oregon, the owners of such slaves respectively shall have the term of three years from the introduction of such slaves to remove them out of the country. 

Section 3.
That if such owners of slaves shall neglect or refuse to remove such slaves from the country within the time specified in the preceding section, such slaves shall be free. 

Section 4.
That when any free negro or mulatto shall have come to Oregon, he or she (as the case may be), if of the age of eighteen or upward, shall remove from and leave the country within the term of two years for males, and three for females, from the passage of this act, and that if any free negro or mulatto shall hereadter come to Oregon, if of the age aforesaid, he or she shall quite and leave the country within the term of two years for males and three for females, from his or her arrival in the country. 

Section 5.
That if such free negro or mulatto be under the age aforesaid, the terms of time specified in the preceding section shall begin to run when he or she arrive at such age.

Section 6.
That if such free negro or mulatto shall fail to quit the country, as required by this act, he or she may be arrested upon a warrant issued by some justice of the peace, and, if guilty upon trial before such justice, shall receive upon his or her bare back not less than twenty nor more than thirty-nine stripes, to be inflicted by the constable of the proper country. 

Section 7.
That if any free negro or mulatto shall fail to quit the country within the term of six months after receiving such stripes, he or she shall again receive the same punishment once in every six months, until he or she shall quit the country. 

Section 8.
That when any slave shall obtain his or her freedom, the time specified in the fourth section shall begin to run from the time when such freedom shall be obtained. 

December amendment.
Be it enacted by the Legislative Committee of Oregon as follows: 

Section 1: That the sixth and seventh sections of said act are hereby repealed. 
Section 2: That if any such free negro or mulatto shall fail to quit and leave the country, as required by the act to which this is amendatory, he or she may be arrested upon a warrant issued by some justice of the peace, and if guilty upon trial before such justice ... the said justice shall issue his order to any officer competent to execute process, directing said officer to give ten days' public notice, by at least four written or printed advertisements, that he will publicly hire out such free negro or mulatto from the country for the shortest term of service, shall enter into a bond with good and sufficient security to Oregon, in a penalty of at least one thousand dollars, binding himself to remove said negro or mulatto out of the country within six months after such service shall expire,; which bond shall be filed in the clerk's office in the proper county, and upon failure to perform the conditions of said bond, the attourney prosecuting for Oregon shall commence a suit upon a certified copy of such bond in the circuit court against such delinquent and his sureties.

1849 law.
In September of 1849, the legislature passed another exclusion law, with a preamble arguing that "it would be highly dangerous to allow free negroes and mulattos to reside in the Territory or to intermix with the Indians, instilling in their minds feelings of hostility against the white race." The 1849 law ordered any blacks entering the territory to leave within 40 days. It was applied in 1851 to Jacob Vanderpool, a West Indian who had migrated to Oregon City. A white resident of the city brought a case against Vanderpool, who was arrested and ordered to leave Oregon within 30 days. Subsequent complaints against the family of <a href="Abner%20Hunt%20Francis">Abner Hunt Francis</a> were ordered out of the state within 40 days, but were allowed to stay after a petition was signed by 225 citizens. The petition formed the basis of a failed coalition to amend the exclusion law to allow for good behavior bonds by black settlers. The Francis family moved to Canada in 1861. A petition was also used in 1854 to prevent the deportation of Morris Thomas and Jane Snowden.

Oregon's congressional delegate, Samuel Thurston, while seeking to limit federal land grants to whites, described the law to congress: "The negroes associate with the Indians and intermarry, and, if their free ingress is encouraged or allowed, there would a relationship spring up between them and the different tribes, and a mixed race would ensue inimical to the whites; and the Indians being led on by the negro who is better acquainted with the customs, language, and manners of the whites, than the Indian, these savages would become much more formidable than they otherwise would, and long and bloody wars would be the fruits of the commingling of the races."

The law was repealed in 1854.

1857 law.
In 1857, Oregon voters had supported <a href="Admission%20to%20the%20Union">statehood</a> for Oregon and subsequently called for a constitutional convention. The emergent constitution contained 185 sections, 172 of which were copied from various other state constitutions, with the additions primarily racial exclusion or finance related. The document enshrined an Exclusion Law into Section 35 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Oregon">Bill of Rights within the Oregon State</a> Constitution. The article read as follows: 

""No free negro or mulatto not residing in this state at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall come, reside or be within this state or hold any real estate, or make any contracts, or maintain any suit therein; and the legislative assembly shall provide by penal laws for the removal by public officers of all such negroes and mulattoes, and for their effectual exclusion from the state, and for the punishment of persons who shall bring them into the state, or employ or harbor them.""

<a href="John%20R.%20McBride">John R. McBride</a>, later a state senator, described the amendment: "It was largely an expression against any mingling of the white with any of the other races, and upon a theory that as we had yet no considerable representation of other races in our midst, we should do nothing to encourage their introduction. We were building a new state on virgin ground; it’s people believed it should encourage only the best elements to come to us, and discourage others." The question of slavery itself was put to a popular vote, with the public voting against slavery (by a vote of 7727 to 2645) but in favor of racial exclusion policies (by a vote of 8640 to 1081). The final state constitution denied "negroes, mulattos and Chinamen" from voting or owning land.

Legacy.
From 1850 to 1860, Oregon saw its black population increase by just 75, compared to an increase of 4,000 in neighboring California. Oregon's black exclusion laws have been linked to a below-average black population - two percent - into the present day. Historian Cheryl Brooks has proposed that Oregon's small black population has made it difficult for Oregonians to recognize racial discrimination problems in the state.

<doc id="54905888" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54905888" title="Tenrec v. USCIS">
Tenrec v. USCIS

Tenrec v. USCIS, colloquially known as the H-1B Lottery Lawsuit, was a class action lawsuit brought against <a href="United%20States%20Citizenship%20and%20Immigration%20Services">United States Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> challenging the lottery process used to decide which cap-subject <a href="H-1B%20visa">H-1B</a> <a href="Form%20I-129">Form I-129</a> petitions to adjudicate in case more petitions were received than the cap for the Fiscal Year. The plaintiffs were two pairs of H-1B petitioner (employer) and beneficiary (prospective employee). The case was decided against the plaintiffs, and an appeal was withdrawn after both plaintiffs withdrew.

Background.
Legislative caps.
The H-1B visa was introduced in its present form by the <a href="Immigration%20Act%20of%201990">Immigration Act of 1990</a>, with an annual cap of 65,000 for temporary skilled workers. The quotas apply for each Fiscal Year, that begins in October of the previous calendar year. <a href="Form%20I-129">Form I-129</a> petitions can be filed at most six months in advance of the start date, so the start date for filing petitions for a given Fiscal Year is April of the preceding calendar year.The most recent legislation changing the caps was the <a href="H-1B%20Visa%20Reform%20Act%20of%202004">H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004</a> (passed December 6, 2004), which added 20,000 cap-exempt slots for workers with United States master's degrees.

Lottery process.
The USCIS published a regulation in the "<a href="Federal%20Register">Federal Register</a>" on May 5, 2005, describing its process for deciding which of the H-1B <a href="Form%20I-129">Form I-129</a> petitions it received in a given Fiscal Year it would adjudicate, while staying within the legislatively determined cap of 65,000 + 20,000. The regulation stated that all petitions "before" the date of crossing the cap would be adjudicated, whereas petitions received on the day of hitting the cap would be subjected to a lottery to select just the right number that would hit the cap. USCIS would not accept further petitions in that Fiscal Year. Moreover, petitions where the beneficiary had a U.S. Master's degree would be counted against the 20,000 limit first, and if that limit was hit before the 65,000 general limit, further such petitions would be counted against the 65,000 limit. Petitions that were submitted later, or that were submitted on the last date and did not win the lottery for the last date, would get no preferential treatment in later years.

In Fiscal Year 2008, the USCIS received enough cap-subject petitions to hit its cap within the first two working days of April, and had to put all petitions through a lottery to select which ones to adjudicate. To reduce pressure on overnight courier services and USCIS service centers, USCIS changed its selection process effective Fiscal Year 2009: it would now receive cap-subject petitions for at least the five working days of April, and, if it received enough petitions in that period, it would stop receiving applications and select petitions to adjudicate by putting all received petitions through a lottery. Unselected petitions in a given year continued to not receive preferential treatment in subsequent years.

Related FOIA lawsuit.
On May 20, 2016 (two weeks before "Tenrec v. USCIS"), the <a href="American%20Immigration%20Lawyers%20Association">American Immigration Lawyers Association</a>, with help from the American Immigration Council, filed a <a href="Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) lawsuit against USCIS, seeking more transparency into the H-1B lottery process. USCIS responds on August 1, 2016, with three affirmative defenses.

Case.
Original lawsuit.
On June 2, 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Oregon">United States District Court for the District of Oregon</a> against the <a href="United%20States%20Citizenship%20and%20Immigration%20Services">United States Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS), challenging the H-1B lottery process. The plaintiffs were two pairs of petitioner (prospective employer) and beneficiary (prospective employee) where the beneficiary had not been selected in the H-1B lottery process:


The plaintiffs were represented by the law firm Parrilli Renison, with attorney Brent Renison the point of contact.

On June 29, the complaint was amended to add claim for failure under the <a href="Administrative%20Procedure%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Administrative Procedure Act</a>. On July 7, a class certification was filed, seeking to represent all employers and employees hurt by the H-1B lottery. A motion for summary judgment was also filed, asking the Court to rule in favor of the plaintiffs and have an orderly lottery.

Motion to dismiss.
On August 8, 2016, USCIS filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On September 22, 2016, Michael Simon, a judge at the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, denied the USCIS' motion to dismiss the lawsuit.

Decision.
Between October 2016 and March 2017, there were several iterations of amended complaints, motions to dismiss, and answers. During this time, one of the original plaintiffs, Tenrec, Inc. and employee Sergii Sinienok, withdrew from the lawsuit, so that Walker Mary LLC and Xiaoyang Zhu were now the lead plaintiffs.

On March 17, 2017, judge Michael Simon made the Oregon District Court's final decision against the plaintiffs, so that the Fiscal Year 2018 lottery (that would be held in April 2017) could proceed as planned. The plaintiffs timely appealed to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> on April 4, but on June 23, the case was dismissed after the plaintiffs withdrew as the lead plaintiffs won the lottery in Fiscal Year 2018 and no other willing lead plaintiff was found.

Reception.
Writing for "<a href="National%20Law%20Review">National Law Review</a>", Cassie Ramos noted that while the lawsuit highlighted problems with the H-1B lottery, the proposed solution of using a waiting list suffered from its own problems, without a way for the employees in the waitlist to continue to stay and work in the country. Instead, the author proposed that the cap gap for <a href="Optional%20Practical%20Training">Optional Practical Training</a> be made flexible so that it could be extended by a year for anybody who did not get through the H-1B lottery. The article highlighted the importance of increasing caps in addressing the underlying issue.

Caroline Lowe

Caroline A. Lowe (1874–1933), generally known as Caroline Lowe, was a 20th-Century Canadian-American labor and civil liberties lawyer and <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist</a> activist for the <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW).

Background.
Caroline Lowe was born on November 28, 1874, in Cottom, Essex County, Ontario, Canada. Her family descended from British loyalists from the American Revolutionary War. Her father was an itinerant lumberjakc. She grew up in <a href="Oskaloosa%2C%20Iowa">Oskaloosa, Iowa</a>. When she was sixteen, she moved to <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>.

Career.
Lowe taught school for many years and became president of the Kansas City Teachers Association.

In 1903, she joined the two-year-old <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist Party of America</a> in Kansas.

As of 1908, she had become a Socialist organizer in Kansas. She worked as a Socialist field worker with miners and their families in Nebraska coal towns. She became a popular Socialist speaker.

By 1911, she had become chairwoman and general correspondent of the party's Woman's National Committee.

In 1918, she was admitted to the bar and practiced in <a href="Girard%2C%20Kansas">Girard, Kansas</a>.

In January 1918, she helped defend IWW member Charlies Krieger in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Fred Moore led the defense team, assisted by Lowe and George Bonstein of Tulsa, in Krieger's first of two trials. Krieger was charged with felony for destroying a building with explosives. The trial began in October and received coverage from as far away as Seattle.

During April to August 1918, she supported <a href="George%20Vanderveer">George Vanderveer</a> in the Chicago trial of 101 "Wobblies" (IWW members), including co-founder <a href="Bill%20Haywood">Bill Haywood</a>.

In 1919, the IWW sent her to New York City to help <a href="Carl%20Recht">Carl Recht</a> on deportation cases occurring in Seattle, Washington: 53 IWW aliens were being sent to <a href="Ellis%20Island">Ellis Island</a> for deportation. These deportation efforts arose from the 1919 <a href="Seattle%20General%20Strike">Seattle General Strike</a>, handled by IWW defender <a href="George%20Vanderveer">George Vanderveer</a>. Recht and Lowe wrote a 200-page report on their findings, which they presented to Immigration and Labor representatives: they saved some 30 from deportation. On February 10, 1919, she gave a speech entitled "The Disillusions of Democracy" at an IWW People's Council fundraiser in New York City.

In December 1919, she co-defended 28 Wobblies in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Kansas">Kansas City, Kansas</a>. In March 1918, a <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a> grand jury had accused them of violating the <a href="Espionage%20Act">Espionage Act</a> and the <a href="Lever%20Act">Lever Act</a> for interruption of petroleum flow. Legal flaws led to a special grand jury in June 1919, which indicted them again under the Espionage and Lever Acts. Despite the efforts of the defense team (Lowe, George Vanderveer, Fred Moore, and Otto Christensen), the jury found 26 guilty (after one of the 28 pled guilty and the last remained at large). Sentence ranges from three to nine years in prison.

Elsa y Elmar

Elsa y Elmar is the name of the musical project of Elsa Carvajal, a singer-songwriter from Colombia. Describing her songs as "spiritual pop", in 2014 she won the Grand Prize in the Latin category of the <a href="John%20Lennon%20Songwriting%20Contest">John Lennon Songwriting Contest</a> for her song "Me Viene Bien", and in 2016 she played in front of 40,000 people as the opening act for <a href="Coldplay">Coldplay</a> at their concert at the <a href="Estadio%20El%20Camp%C3%ADn">Estadio El Campín</a> in <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>.

History.
Born in <a href="Bucaramanga">Bucaramanga</a> in Colombia, Carvajal took some classes in musical appreciation and flute at the age of nine, but admitted that she had little discipline to continue with them. At the age of 16 she enrolled in a jazz academy, and then in 2011 she traveled to <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> in order to study at the <a href="Berklee%20College%20of%20Music">Berklee College of Music</a>. Carvajal came up with the concept of Elsa y Elmar in 2012 during her time in Boston. In an interview with Colombia's W Radio, Carvajal explained that she liked the idea of being accompanied rather than being a solo star, and that the people who surrounded her and supported her music were her "sea" – the name "Elmar" is a play on "el mar", meaning "the sea" in Spanish. In 2013 she recorded a six-track <a href="extended%20play">EP</a> titled "Sentirnos Bien", produced by <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>-born Colombian Mateo Lewis, himself a former student of Berklee. The EP was released in digital format on October 13, 2013. One of the tracks from "Sentirnos Bien", "Me Viene Bien", was entered into the second session of the 2014 <a href="John%20Lennon%20Songwriting%20Contest">John Lennon Songwriting Contest</a> for new songwriters and won the Grand Prize in the Latin category.

On completing her studies at Berklee, Carvajal moved to San Francisco, where she assembled a band to accompany her live perfomances. Elsa y Elmar's first full-length album, "Rey", was released on September 25, 2015. It was preceded by a single, "Exploradora", which was accompanied by a video shot in various parks and beaches around San Francisco.

In 2015, Elsa y Elmar performed at a number of music festivals, including <a href="Est%C3%A9reo%20Picnic%20Festival">Estéreo Picnic Festival</a> in <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>, Colombia and Festival Coordenada in <a href="Guadalajara">Guadalajara</a>, Mexico.

Helmut Lehmann (politician)

Helmut Lehmann (1 December 1882 - 9 February 1959) was a <a href="East%20Germany">German</a> politician (<a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a>/<a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a>).

Life.
Helmut Erich Johannes Lehmann was born in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. His father was a writer. He attended school in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a> and <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> and then between 1897 ad 1899, undertook an apprenticeship in carpentry at <a href="Sch%C3%B6neiche">Schöneiche</a>, a small town just outside Berlin on its eastern side. Between 1900 and 1903 he was employed first as an assistant in a lawyer's office and then with a health insurance organisation ("Krankenkasse"). In 1900 he joined the national office workers' trades union (""Zentralverband der Büroangestellten"") and from then till 1900 was also working as a trades union official at the union's Berlin office.

In 1903 Lehmann joined the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democratic Party (""Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands"" / SPD)</a>. In 1903 he became a department head at the at Berlin where he worked, a position he retained till 1907. In 1904 he established and became chairman of the League for Apprentices and Young Workers in Prussia. Between 1905 and 1913 he contributed as an editor to the "Deutsche Angestellte Zeitung" (""German Clerical Workers' Newspaper"") and he was also active as an author and producer of publications for the health insurance organisation. During these years, between 1907 and 1914, he was secretary for the Union of Office Workers (""Verband der Büroangestellten"").

In 1918/19, during the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319">year of revolutions</a> that followed <a href="First%20World%20War">national military defeat</a>, Lehmann participated as a member of the <a href="Workers%27%20council">Soldiers' and Workers' Soviet</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>.

Between 1914 and 1924 he was secretary of the National Association of German Health Insurance Organisations, based at one stage in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, moving on to serve as the Berlin-based executive chairman of the National Association between 1924 and 1933.

Everything changed in January 1933 when the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazis</a> <a href="Machtergreifung">took power</a> and lost no time in <a href="Gleichschaltung">transforming</a> <a href="Weimar%20Germany">Germany</a> into a <a href="One-party%20state">one-</a><a href="Nazi%20Party">party</a> <a href="Enabling%20Act%20of%201933">dictatorship</a>. Although <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany">Communist activists</a> were at the top of the government hit list, others with a record of activism in the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> and the union movement also attracted the attention of the authorities. Lehmann was deprived of his offices and almost at once arrested, spending time in government detention during March/April 1933. In June 1935 he was again taken into "investigative custody", identified as the leader of a resistance group in Berlin comprising members of illegal organisations: Social Democrats and Trades Unionists. A few years later the <a href="20%20July%20plot">assassination plot against Hitler</a> failed in its primary objective but succeeded in making the government acutely nervous. They dusted down a pre-prepared plan and on the night of 22/23 August 1944 mass arrests took place across Germany in an exercise identified as "<a href="Aktion%20Gitter">Aktion Gitter</a>". What the people arrested had in common was that before 1933 they had been listed as active politically, usually as members of the Communist Party, the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> or the trades union movement. Many of those sought, especially Communists, had long since fled abroad. Others had died, sometimes simply of old age. But that still left more than 4,000 who were arrested: Hans Lehmann was one of these. On January 1945 the <a href="People%27s%20Court%20%28Germany%29">special People's Court</a> sentenced him to a year in prison for "Backing the enemy" (""Feindbegünstigung"").

He was released from Berlin's on 22 April 1945 as the <a href="Red%20army">Soviet army</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Berlin">took possession</a> of what remained of the city. The end of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">war</a> marked a return for Lehmann to mainstream politics in what was <a href="Soviet%20Military%20Administration%20in%20Germany">administered</a>, between May 1945 and October 1949, as the <a href="Soviet%20occupation%20zone">Soviet occupation zone</a>. During May and June 1945 Lehmann worked with the economy department in the Berlin municipal quarters of <a href="Pankow">Pankow</a> and <a href="Wedding%20%28Berlin%29">Wedding</a>. Then, through July 1945, he served as deputy chief of the Social Security Establishment for <a href="Greater%20Berlin">Greater Berlin</a>, a position from which he moved on to create the National Administration for Labour and Welfare Affairs (""Zentralverwaltung für Arbeit und Sozialfürsorge"") in the zone relaunched, in October 1949, as the <a href="Group%20of%20Soviet%20Forces%20in%20Germany">Soviet sponsored</a> <a href="German%20Democratic%20Republic">German Democratic Republic</a>, retaining responsibility within that organisation as a vice-president of it till 1950.

In June 1945 Lehmann became a member of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> party central committee. He was one of those participating in the party conference of April 1946 at which the SPD and the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany">Communist Party</a> voted, applying processes that would remain contentious, for a <a href="Merger%20of%20the%20KPD%20and%20SPD%20into%20the%20Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">merger</a> which resulted in the creation of a new party, the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">Socialist Unity Party (""Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands"" / SED)</a>. The architects of the process evidently hoped to find a way for the merger to apply across the <a href="Allied%20occupation%20of%20Germany">four occupation zones</a> into which the western two thirds of Germany had been divided in 1945, but in the event the party merger only took effect in the <a href="Soviet%20occupation%20zone">Soviet occupation zone</a>, and by the time the Soviet zone was relaunched as the German Democratic Republic the SED was well on the way to becoming the ruling party in a new kind of German <a href="One-party%20state">one-party</a> <a href="Constitution%20of%20East%20Germany">dictatorship</a>. From the outset Helmut Lehmann was a senior figure within the new party, appointed to the Party Executive in 1946, and remaining a member between 1949 and his death in 1959 after the Party Executive became the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany%23Central%20Committee">Party Central Committee</a>. Under the Leninist constitutional structure being created, power rested not with any parliament or government ministers but with the party central committee, though the fact that the same individuals were frequently members of more than one of the institutions involved made the Central Committee's dominance less stark than it might otherwise have been. Not all Central Committee members carried equal weight. The Central Committee was directed by the country's <a href="Walter%20Ulbricht">leadership</a> through its <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany%23Politburo%20of%20the%20Central%20Committee">Politburo</a>. Lehmann was a Politburo member during 1949/50. Working in a commission chaired by <a href="Anton%20Ackermann">Anton Ackermann</a>, he was one of those who worked on drafting the Basic principals and objectives of the new party.

The focus of Lehmann's political interest remained, as it has been before 1933, social welfare, and several of his additional appointments reflected this. In 1946 he was appointed president of <a href="People%27s%20Solidarity">Volkssolidarität (""People's Solidarity"")</a>, an organisation for older citizens integrated, like various other official mass organisations, into the national political power structure in a supportive capacity. He was chairman between 1950 and 1958/1959 of the National Executive for Social Insurance (""Zentralvorstandes der Sozialversicherung""). One authoritative source defined his role more succinctly as being "Head of Social Insurance" (""Chef der DDR-Sozialversicherung""). He also held senior positions in the <a href="Free%20German%20Trade%20Union%20Federation">Trades Union Federation</a>.

At a regional level he sat as a member of the <a href="Landtag%20of%20Thuringia">Landtag of Thuringia</a> between 1946 and 1949. At the national level, during 1949/50 he was a member of the <a href="Volkskammer">provisional national parliament (""Volkskammer"")</a>. According to some sources he then remained a Volkskammer member till his death in 1959.


Awards and honours.
After his death various East German entities were renamed in his honour including a Trades Union holiday village at <a href="Johanngeorgenstadt">Johanngeorgenstadt</a>. In 1982 his face appeared on a postage stamp.

Elmer Smith (activist)

Elmer Smith (1888–1932) was a 20th-Century American lawyer and <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> union defender, who played a key role in the 1919 <a href="Centralia%20massacre%20%28Washington%29">Centralia massacre (Washington)</a>.

1919 Centralia massacre.
"See also <a href="Centralia%20massacre%20%28Washington%29">Centralia massacre (Washington)</a>"

The IWW opened a local in <a href="Centralia%2C%20Washington">Centralia, Washington</a> early in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. By 1918, they had clashed with the local <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> after the burning of a first IWW union hall in 1938. The IWW re-opened in a second location. 

Elmer Smith was a local lawyer, sympathetic to the IWW. A <a href="Pacifism">pacifist</a>, he strongly encouraged union members to pursue a non-violent course and to try to reach a peaceful arrangement with the other residents of Centralia. He also reached out to the governor to attempt to get him to intervene to prevent a vigilante raid. The landlady for the hall and Britt Smith (no relation), the local IWW secretary, contacted law enforcement and asked for protection, but were told nothing was possible. The Wobblies then printed and widely distributed a flier calling on the people of Centralia to take action. None of these efforts yielded any response. With this being the case an extra-legal raid on the Wobbly hall seemed likely. 

With attempts at a peaceful compromise unsuccessful, local IWW leader Britt Smith pressed Elmer Smith for additional advice. Elmer Smith agreed that it would be legal for the Wobblies to physically defend themselves, but, as he later testified, only in self-defense if attacked first. The IWW members interpreted this legal advice as justification to arm themselves for what they perceived as an inevitable and dangerous confrontation.

During Smith's trial the following year for his part in the Centralia Massacre, prosecutors would present this advice as proof that the IWW had planned the massacre. However, considering Elmer Smith's strong belief in non-violence and seeming good character, it is doubtful that armed conflict was his objective. The true intent of Smith's recommendation will probably never be known.

After the massacre (in which six people were killed), officials arrested Smith, although he had participated in the massacre. Later, he was acquitted and released. He died before Governor <a href="Clarence%20D.%20Martin">Clarence D. Martin</a> (1884–1955) commuted sentences.

It is listed as a <a href="Major%20Historical%20and%20Cultural%20Site%20Protected%20at%20the%20National%20Level">Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level</a>.

History.
The mansion was where Gurun Princess Kejing lived after her marriage to a member of the Mongolian <a href="Borjigin">Borjigin</a> clan. The <a href="Dzungar%E2%80%93Qing%20Wars">Dzungar–Qing Wars</a> meant that the territory now known as <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> was unsafe for a <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing</a> princess, so the <a href="Kangxi%20Emperor">Kangxi Emperor</a> decreed that she should reside in <a href="Hohhot">Hohhot</a>, then known as Guihua City (). The site for the residence was selected in 1703, and all materials and labour for its construction came from the area surrounding Hohhot. The princess' residence was completed in 1705.

The residence was occupied by descendants of Gurun Princess Kejing until the 20th century. In 1923, it was taken over and used by Hohhot Municipal Normal School. The Hohhot Museum acquired the complex in 1990.

In 2001, the complex was listed as a <a href="Major%20Historical%20and%20Cultural%20Site%20Protected%20at%20the%20National%20Level">Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level</a> by the <a href="State%20Administration%20of%20Cultural%20Heritage">State Administration of Cultural Heritage</a>.

Structure.
The residential complex measures 180m from north to south, 63m from east to west. It is laid out <a href="Chinese%20architecture%23Architectural%20bilateral%20symmetry">symmetrically east-west</a>, with the central axis from south to north featuring a <a href="spirit%20screen">spirit screen</a>, main entrance, ceremonial entrance, main hall (called Jingyi Tang 靜宜堂), a house-style passage (), bedchamber, and a rear building (). Each of the four internal courtyards and buildings along the central axis is flanked by opposing side buildings.

The building is only one storey high and the walls are very thick to protect against the cold winters experienced in Hohhot. The main hall has traditional latticed windows, whilst the bechamber has windows set high into the wall that can be opened.

Starlink: Battle for Atlas is an upcoming <a href="action-adventure%20video%20game">action-adventure video game</a> developed by <a href="Ubisoft%20Toronto">Ubisoft Toronto</a> and published by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>.

The game features optional <a href="toys-to-life">toys-to-life</a> elements.

Setting.
The game is set in the Atlas star system. Early on in the game, the players' mother ship, Equinox, was ambushed by The Forgotten Legion and crashed on a nearby planet. The captain of the ship was taken hostage by the Legion. The Forgotten Legion, lead by Grax, was obsessed with an extinct race called The Wardens, who had left a lot of their ancient technology behind. Grax, who wants to use such technology for his own legion, will become a constant threat that players must face throughout their journey.

Gameplay.
"Starlink: Battle for Atlas" is an <a href="action%20game">action game</a> set in the Atlas star system. In the game, the player venture into different parts of the Atlas system, meet with different aliens species and form an alliance with them in order to build a crew. Forming these alliances changes the game's world state, which will then changes the game's gameplay experience. In the game, players can use their spaceships to explore the Atlas system, which is an <a href="open%20world">open world</a> in which players can freely explore. <a href="Split-screen">Split-screen</a> multiplayer is also featured in the game, allowing two players to explore planets together. All ships can take off into space, and skim on planet's surface. The transition between space and planet surface is described as "seamless". Each planet has their own landscape, story, wildlife, and hazards that may become a threat to the player. Players can engage in both space combat and land-based combat with enemies using spaceships. These spaceships can be extensively customized with different parts. Wings, weapons, and spacecraft modules can be freely swapped at will. Players are encouraged to experiment with different combinations of weapons as different enemies react differently to attacks. Pilots are also present and has special abilities that can be utilized in combat. For instance, one type of pilot can slow down time. There are 4 types of ships and 4 types of pilots.

While the game can be played digitally, the game features <a href="toys-to-life">toys-to-life</a> elements in which players can buy toys, which are ship components, for the game. Players can place their toys on a custom controller mount, and their digital counterpart will appear on-screen. When players swap the components of their real-life toy ships, its counterpart will also reflect such changes instantly. Each ship has two points which allow players to connect spacecraft parts with the ships. Purchasing a physical part also unlocks its digital counterpart, meaning that players do not necessarily have to use the toys and the controller mount to play the game.

Development.
The game is being developed by <a href="Ubisoft%20Toronto">Ubisoft Toronto</a>. Development for the game begun after the CEO of Ubisoft Yves Guillemot assigned the team to create a new game which mixes "breakthrough technology and innovative gameplay". Shortly after, a small team of 10 developers began brainstorming different ideas and pitching it to the developers. The team eventually came up with the idea of creating a new <a href="toys-to-life">toys-to-life</a> game, and this idea was approved by Guillemot. The team then soon began prototyping the technology of a Starlink spaceship, which includes exposed wires and duct tape. Nonetheless, it received an enthusiastic reaction from the team and they soon began working on creating the Atlas system, which set the game's foundation as an <a href="open%20world">open world</a> game. While the game was originally intended for kids aged between 8 and 11, the team later changed the target audience to include a wider age group after seeing the positive reaction from parents who have watched their kids playing the game. The game features a two-player cooperative multiplayer mode as the team thought that it will be interesting to see players exchanging parts for their ships during play. According to the game's producer, Matthew Rose, the team "never want to tell kids they're being creative wrong". Therefore, the team allowed players to combine all parts freely, including having the wings of the spacecraft placed upside down and the weapons facing backward.

The <a href="toys-to-life">toys-to-life</a> technology featured in "Starlink" was developed in-house by Ubisoft Toronto. To ensure that the game is consumer-friendly, this aspect of the game was made optional, meaning that players can play the game digitally without purchasing any of the toys. Critics commented on the timing in which Ubisoft announced the title. It was during the time where popular <a href="toys-to-life">toys-to-life</a> titles including "<a href="Skylanders">Skylanders</a>" and "<a href="Disney%20Infinity">Disney Infinity</a>" failed to become successful. According to Laurent Malville, the game's creative director, the team believed that the game had enough innovation to revive the failing genre. "Starlink: Battle for Atlas" was announced by publisher <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> at its press conference during <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202017">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017</a>. The game is set to be released in the third or fourth quarter in 2018 for <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>. Several critics believed that "Starlink" was the game teased by Ubisoft in one of "<a href="Watch%20Dogs%202">Watch Dogs 2</a>"s side-missions, though it was never confirmed by Ubisoft.

Nona Bellairs

Nona Maria Stephenson Bellairs (1824–1897) was a British author of travel guides, botanical guidebooks, and novels. She was also a philanthropist who assisted weavers in <a href="Bedworth">Bedworth</a> to emigrate following the collapse of the local ribbon-weaving industry in the 1860s.

Biography.
Nona Maria Stephenson Bellairs was born into a large family. Her mother was Dorothy (Mackenzie) Bellairs, the daughter of a wealthy sugar planter in the West Indies, and her father was the Rev. Henry Bellairs (1790-1872), who was at various times in his career <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> of <a href="Bedworth">Bedworth</a> in Warwickshire, <a href="vicar">vicar</a> of <a href="Hunsingore">Hunsingore</a> in Yorkshire, and an honorary <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Worcester Cathedral</a>. 

Bellairs wrote several travel books that doubled as botanical guidebooks, the first of which, "Going Abroad" (1857), was set in France and Italy. Her hybrid approach is evident in this extract from the book's table of contents: "Nice — The English Church — "<a href="Asplenium%20trichomanes">Asplenium Trichomanes</a>" — Mentone — A Country Carnival — "<a href="Cheilanthes">Cheilanthes</a> Odora"". Her guidebook and memoir "Hardy Ferns" (1865) was a product of the later stages of the <a href="Pteridomania">Victorian craze for collecting ferns</a>. Bellairs called for protection of ferns, some of which were becoming very rare due to overcollecting, writing: "The poor Ferns, like the wolves in olden time, have a price set upon their heads, and they in like manner will soon altogether disappear. We must have 'Fern laws', and preserve them like game."

She also wrote at least two novels, the first of which, "Redmarsh Rectory" (1859), may have been inspired in part by her experiences as the daughter of a minister. Her second novel, "Strength and Weakness" (1867), was a story of factory life.

Critics generally praised her writing as refined and pleasant. 

In Bedworth, where her father was rector, the ribbon-weaving industry collapsed in the 1860s. Bellairs is remembered for her great efforts assisting local jobless weavers and their families to emigrate to Australia.

Tomorrow Sunny / The Revelry, Spp

Tomorrow Sunny / The Revelry, Spp is an album by American jazz saxophonist <a href="Henry%20Threadgill">Henry Threadgill</a> with his band Zooid, featuring Jose Davila on trombone and tuba, <a href="Liberty%20Ellman">Liberty Ellman</a> on guitar, Stomu Takeishi on bass guitar, Elliot Humberto Kavee on drums, and new member Christopher Hoffman on cello, who joined the group making it a sextet.

Reception.
The "<a href="Down%20Beat">Down Beat</a>" review by <a href="John%20Corbett%20%28writer%29">John Corbett</a> states "With this incarnation of Zooid, Threadgill has yet again found the ideal vehicle for his evolving ideas."

The <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a> review by Troy Collins says "Bolstered by the unswerving dedication of his longstanding sidemen, "Tomorrow Sunny / The Revelry, Spp" continues the ongoing documentation of Threadgill's Zooid, a consistently fascinating endeavor from one of the most compelling composers of our time."

In a review for "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>", John Garratt notes ""Tomorrow Sunny/The Revlery, Spp" is the sound of Zooid branching out and out some more. They’re becoming more somber and melodic, more edgy and chaotic, softer and louder, seemingly all at once."

The "<a href="JazzTimes">JazzTimes</a>" review by Mike Shanley states "Everything has a strong sense of direction, even during moments when things sound spare and minimal. As a result, the album comes off as the most focused Zooid release yet."

Antifa movements

Antifa movements are post-<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> <a href="left%20politics">left</a>, often <a href="anarchist">anarchist</a>, <a href="extra-parliamentary%20opposition">extra-parliamentary</a> political movements opposing political ideas and movements that members describe as <a href="fascist">fascist</a>. Such movements have been active in several countries in the second half of the 20th and early 21st century.

History.
Germany: Cold War "anti-fascism" and after.
From 1961 the <a href="East%20Germany">East German</a> <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">Socialist Unity Party</a> used the term "Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart" () as the official name for the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, in sharp contrast to the West Berlin city government which would sometimes refer to it as the "<a href="Wall%20of%20Shame">Wall of Shame</a>".

The modern Germany movement most commonly associated with anti-fascism originated in the late 1980s, growing out of <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>'s <a href="squatter">squatter</a> scene and <a href="autonomism">autonomism</a> movement. This movement ultimately has its origins in the student-based "<a href="Au%C3%9Ferparlamentarische%20Opposition">Außerparlamentarische Opposition</a>" and the values associated with the <a href="new%20social%20movements">new social movements</a>. Unlike the 1930s "<a href="Antifaschistische%20Aktion">Antifaschistische Aktion</a>", which adhered to <a href="Marxist-Leninism">Marxist-Leninism</a> and was part of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany">Communist Party of Germany</a>, concerned with industrial working-class politics against Hitler's <a href="NSDAP">NSDAP</a>, the late 1980s and early 1990s "autonomists" were instead independent "anti-authoritarian" <a href="Libertarian%20Marxists">Libertarian Marxists</a> and <a href="anarcho-communists">anarcho-communists</a>, not associated with any particular party. The publication "<a href="Antifaschistisches%20Infoblatt">Antifaschistisches Infoblatt</a>" was in operation since 1987, seeking to expose radical nationalists publicly. In 2003, they joined Antifa-Net, part of an international network, including the likes of Britain's "<a href="Searchlight%20%28magazine%29">Searchlight</a>" and Sweden's "<a href="Expo%20%28magazine%29">Expo</a>".

It was after <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a> in 1990, that most of the Antifa groups were formed. For example, the "Autonomen Antifa (M)" was created in <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a> in 1990. Following the rise of the <a href="National%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">National Democratic Party of Germany</a> and some actions of extra-parliamentary violence such as the <a href="Solingen%20arson%20attack%20of%201993">Solingen arson attack of 1993</a>, more groups were formed. "Antifaschistische Aktion Berlin", founded in 1993 was one of the more prominent groups and the "Antifaschistische Aktion/Bundesweite Organisation" was founded to coordinate these groups across Germany. Aside from their violent clashes with ultra-nationalists, these groups participated in the annual <a href="May%20Day%20in%20Kreuzberg">May Day in Kreuzberg</a>, which typically end in large scale riots. The German Antifa movement fractured in 2001 into two camps; the <a href="Anti-Germans%20%28political%20current%29">Anti-Germans</a> (who are pro-<a href="Israel">Israel</a>) and the Anti-Imperialists (who take the more standard radical left stance of <a href="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a>). The AA/BO splintered into different groups as a result of this.

According to the <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="intelligence%20agency">intelligence agency</a> <a href="Federal%20Office%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20the%20Constitution">Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution</a>, the contemporary anti-fascist movement in Germany includes those who are willing to use violence.
Militant behaviour against police is an expression of the "Autonome Szene" and part of the concept "Antifaschistische Aktion".
There are illustrations made public in the antifascist movement with mottoes that sometimes call for not only violence against police or skinheads but also bishops and judges. There are slogans like "antifascism means attack" not only against neonazis but also against the civil and capitalist system of the "Bundesrepublik Deutschland". In modern usage, anti-fascism is sometimes shortened to "Antifa".

One of the bigger antifascist campaigns in Germany in recent years was the effort to block the annual <a href="Neo-Nazi%20marches%20in%20Dresden">Neo-Nazi marches in Dresden</a>.

United Kingdom: against the NF and BNP.
After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Jewish <a href="war%20veteran">war veteran</a>s in the <a href="43%20Group">43 Group</a> continued the tradition of militant confrontations with <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a>'s <a href="Union%20Movement">Union Movement</a>. In the 1960s, the <a href="62%20Group">62 Group</a> continued the struggle against <a href="Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazis</a>.

In the 1970s, fascist and far-right parties such as the <a href="National%20Front%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Front</a> (NF) and <a href="British%20Movement">British Movement</a> (BM) were making significant gains electorally, and were increasingly bold in their public appearances. This was challenged in 1977 with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lewisham">Battle of Lewisham</a>, when thousands of people disrupted an NF march in <a href="South%20London">South London</a>. Soon after, the <a href="Anti-Nazi%20League">Anti-Nazi League</a> (ANL) was launched by the <a href="Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28UK%29">Socialist Workers Party</a> (SWP). The ANL had a large-scale propaganda campaign and squads that attacked NF meetings and paper sales. The success of the ANL's campaigns contributed to the end of the NF's period of growth. During this period, there were also a number of black-led anti-fascist organisations, including the <a href="Campaign%20Against%20Racism%20and%20Fascism">Campaign Against Racism and Fascism</a> (CARF) and local groups like the <a href="Newham%20Monitoring%20Project">Newham Monitoring Project</a>.

The SWP disbanded the ANL in 1981, but many squad members refused to stop their activities. They were expelled from the SWP in 1981, many going on to found <a href="Red%20Action">Red Action</a>. The SWP used the term <a href="squadism">squadism</a> to dismiss these militant anti-fascists as thugs. In 1985, some members of Red Action and the <a href="Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalist</a> <a href="Direct%20Action%20Movement">Direct Action Movement</a> launched <a href="Anti-Fascist%20Action%20%28UK%29">Anti-Fascist Action</a> (AFA). Their founding document said "we are not fighting Fascism to maintain the status quo but to defend the interests of the working class". Thousands of people took part in AFA mobilisations, such as <a href="Remembrance%20Day">Remembrance Day</a> demonstrations in 1986 and 1987, the Unity Carnival, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cable%20Street">Battle of Cable Street</a>'s 55th anniversary march in 1991, and the "Battle of Waterloo" against <a href="Blood%20and%20Honour">Blood and Honour</a> in 1992. After 1995, some AFA mobilisations still occurred, such as against the NF in <a href="Dover">Dover</a> in 1997 and 1998. However, AFA wound down its national organisation and some of its branches and had ceased to exist nationally by 2001.

There was a surge in fascist activity across Europe from 1989 to 1991 after the collapse of communism. In 1991, the Campaign Against Fascism in Europe (CAFE) coordinated a large militant protest against the visit to London by French right-wing leader, <a href="Jean-Marie%20Le%20Pen">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>. This sparked a surge in anti-fascist organisations throughout Europe. In the UK alone, in 1992 a number of left-wing groups formed anti-fascist <a href="front%20organisation">front organisation</a>s, such as a re-launched ANL in 1992, the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Socialist Party's</a> <a href="Youth%20against%20Racism%20in%20Europe">Youth against Racism in Europe</a> YRE, and the <a href="Revolutionary%20Communist%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201978%29">Revolutionary Communist Party's</a> Workers Against Racism. A number of black-led organisations, along with the Labour Party Black Sections and the National Black Caucus, formed the Anti-Racist Alliance in 1991, which eventually became the <a href="National%20Assembly%20Against%20Racism">National Assembly Against Racism</a>.

In 2001, some former AFA members founded the militant anti-fascist group No Platform, but this group soon disbanded. In 2004, members of the <a href="Anarchist%20Federation%20%28Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">Anarchist Federation</a>, <a href="Class%20War">Class War</a>, and No Platform founded the organisation Antifa. This predominantly anarchist group has imitated AFA's stance of physical and ideological confrontation with fascism.

Sweden: Antifascistisk Aktion activities.
Antifascistisk Aktion (AFA) is an anti-fascist group founded in Sweden in 1993. AFA's "Activity Guide" advocates violence against <a href="neo-Nazis">neo-Nazis</a>. Some in the mainstream media have labelled them <a href="far%20left">left-wing extremists</a>. An editorial in the <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> newspaper "<a href="Expressen">Expressen</a>" argued that the label "anti-fascist" was misleading, because of the organization's methods, such as stealing the subscriber list of the <a href="National%20Democrats%20%28Sweden%29">National Democrats</a> newspaper, and threatening the subscribers. Other critics say the group does not respect <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, because some members have attacked moderate <a href="conservatism">conservatives</a> and other <a href="Nationalism">nationalists</a>.

Twenty-first century.
In the 2010s, self-described anti-fascist groups have become increasingly active in Western Europe and North America. These loose collectives first arose in the early 2010s in response to growing nationalism in countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, and France. In the US, anti-fascist groups had existed since at least 1988 in the form of the <a href="Anti-Racist%20Action">Anti-Racist Action</a>, but <a href="Antifa%20%28U.S.%29">Antifa</a> have become increasingly active since 2016., often affiliated with <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>, and have become known for their clashes with <a href="far-right">far-right</a> and <a href="alt-right">alt-right</a> groups. US anti-fascist activities have included violent disruptions and demonstrations, drawing criticism from both the political right and political left.

On August 12, 2017, at a <a href="2017%20Unite%20the%20Right%20rally">white nationalist rally</a> in Charlottesville, Virginia, a man rammed his vehicle into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters, killing one and injuring 19.

Knowles Primary School

Knowles Primary School is a large school situated in Bletchley, Milton Keynes. It is sited between Queensway and Leon Recreational ground in Fenny Stratford. The current format of the School was established in 2012, following the merger of Knowles Infant and Knowles Junior Schools but there has been a school or schools, with varying names, on the site since the 1890s.

In addition to the usual classroom space, there is a large gym, dining area, two assembly halls, two libraries, a computer suite and cookery areas.

Knowles Primary has gone through many changes over the years including plenty of name changes.

History of Knowles Primary

The first school was built and opened in 1890 to where, following the summer break, the girls and infants were transferred from High Street schools. This was enlarged in 1894.

Mr John Cowlishaw, who died in 1961 at the age of 74 years, had the distinction of being the last headmaster of the High Street school and the first headmaster of the new Bletchley Road schools when they were opened in 1897 to which the boys who had remained at High Street until the Board school for boys was built were transferred.

Further expansion became necessary and in 1901 a new girls’ school was built at the rear of the site, backing on to the recreation ground. Later, a Nursery school was built in the playground opposite.

A period of consolidation then took place, but the schools were again extended in 1937 by the addition of a new main hall and more classrooms. Reorganisation followed, with the County Junior School occupying the whole of the eastern end of the site from the path by St Martin’s Hall to the main avenue leading to the recreation ground. The western side of the avenue, including the hall and new classroom block, became the County Senior School for boys and girls.

The Infants’ School was then moved to the original girls’ school by the recreation ground.

During the Second World War Bletchley was to host hundreds of Evacuees and Schools.

With the return to peace in 1945, further alterations were made and a new Gymnasium built in 1956.

In the early 1960s the school had a name change. It would now be called Leon Secondary School and Leon County Junior School. At this time there was a lot of expansion in and around the Bletchley area and Milton Keynes. Part of this expansion was the Lakes Estate. In September 1973 Leon Secondary School moved to Fern Grove on the Lakes Estate and took the name Leon with them.

The school then took the name Knowles junior School. The name 'Knowles' came from a local tythe map which included 'Knowles Field' and was adopted by the school. The school reopened at 9 am in its new role as a Middle School. There being no new forms of entry the year groups were renumbered 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th. As numbers were somewhat light in the 2nd year and lower in the 3rd these two age groups had been placed together to give four parallel classes of about 32 children, to be known as 23 D, P, T and L. This would enable us to admit up to 12 new children to this lower part of the school without the classes becoming unduly large.

At the turn of the century it was decided that Knowles Junior School and the Infant School should be amalgamated a process that was finished in 2012. The school from that point would be called Knowles Primary School.

Present Day

Part of the amalgamation involved expanding Knowles from 2 form entry to a 3 form entry across the school. Following the amalgamation in 2012, it was decided to name the three buildings which made up the newly named Knowles Primary School. One of the buildings was to be named 'Evergreens', what had been the Infant School became known as 'Orchard Building' and what had been known the Junior School became known as 'Woodlands'. From 2012-14, Orchard made up Foundation, Year 1 and Year 2 while Woodlands made up years 3 to 6. Once Evergreens opened in 2014, it was decided that Orchard Building would have Foundation and year 1, Evergreens would have years 2 and 3 while Woodlands would have years 4 to 6.

During the winter of 2014, extensive redevelopment went on throughout the school. Although there was a fair amount of disruption for the children, they did not let it bother them and dealt with all aspects of the changes extremely maturely. Spring 2015 finally brought an end to the redevelopment and the end product very good and the children loved the new lay out.

Following the summer of 2017, Evergreens will no longer be used to teach children. The year groups will go back to the buildings they were in before Evergreens opened.

Within The Kepler-124 system (KOI-241 system) there are three known planets, Kepler-124b being both the closest to its parent star, and smallest.

Characteristics.
Kepler-124b is an exo<a href="planet">planet</a> discovered in 2014 located 359 parsecs (1170 light years) from earth orbiting the star Kepler-124. Both Kepler-124b and its host star are smaller than our own star and Earth at an estimated 56% smaller comparing Kepler-124 with the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, and an estimated 40% smaller comparing Kepler-124b with Earth. Kepler-124b’s radius is 0.067±0.005 <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> radii and 0.73±0.05 Earth radii. It’s the smallest discovered planet in the Kepler-124 system, and orbits the closest to its star of the three other planets. Kepler-124b Orbits 96% closer to its star than Earth which in the Kepler-124 system is farther in than the inner limit of the <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a>. After a more recent Statistical Analysis done by a team at <a href="NASA">NASA</a> at the <a href="Ames%20Research%20Center">Ames Research Center</a>, Kepler-124b was validated with 99% assurance along with Kepler-124c and Kepler-124d. Although scientists are very sure about some of Kepler-124b’s parameters, many are still unknown. 
Discovery.
Kepler-124b like many Exoplanets discovered by the Kepler <a href="telescope">telescope</a>, in 2014 was found using the transit method. The transit method utilizes the high magnification and numerous instruments on the Kepler Telescope to detect slight fluctuations in brightness of a star being observed. These dips can indicate the presence planet and determine certain parameters of it as well. Kepler-124b was originally only a planet candidate but was later confirmed as an exoplanet.

Palace Office (Oman)

The Palace Office () <a href="Romanization%20of%20Arabic">transliterated</a>: "maktab al qasr" is one of the most senior and therefore powerful ministries in the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Oman">Sultanate of Oman</a>. It is a government body that has most influence in national security and intelligence issues and the minister in charge has been the de facto national security advisor to the Sultan. The Palace Office also acts as a foreign liaison focus on all international intelligence and security matters.

The minister holding the post has the full title Minister of the Palace Office and Head of the Office of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The Palace Office Minister currently serves as the chair of the Defence Council (on behalf of the Sultan). The Defence Council is an extra-parliamentary body tasked with coordinating the actions of the country's various security and armed forces. 

The current Minister of the Palace Office is General Sultan bin Mohammed al Nua'mani (appointed in 2011); he had been Secretary General of the Royal Court Affairs. Nasser bin Hamoud al Kindi took over the latter post.

The Palace Office is located in <a href="Qurum">Qurum</a>. Its nearest government agency neighbor being the <a href="Internal%20Security%20Service">Internal Security Service</a> (ISS), also based in Qurum (Post Code 112).

History.
Although the Palace Office as is may not have been established until the 1980s there is evidence that British advisors had begun the work of setting the office up as early as 1972. Certainly influential characters such as Brigadier Sir <a href="Timothy%20Landon">Timothy Landon</a> and Sheilagh Bailey were critical in developing the early functionality of what would become the Palace Office. It was particularly important that the small nucleus of trusted advisors made arrangements to secure the ruler of Oman in the 1970s and establish contacts with neighboring states to ensure their cooperation.

Office Functions.
The functions of the Minister of the Palace Office are:

National Security Challenges.
It seems certain that the main National Security Challenges affecting Oman are internal rather than external and an attempted <a href="coup%20d%27etat">coup d'etat</a> in 2005, which was easily quashed and street unrest in the spring of 2011 and later in 2012, all point to a simmering unrest with the status quo. 

In early March 2011 HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said decided to replace two key ministers who were seen by many as not keeping in touch with young Omanis not benefiting from Oman's national advances. The long-standing favorite advisor of the Sultan General Ali bin Majid al Maamari was replaced by the relatively unknown and younger General Sultan bin Mohammed al Nua'mani. The current Minister's remit appears unchanged.

The Sultanate has also experienced challenges in maintaining its neutrality in the conflict in neighboring <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>. It has been accused by its <a href="Gulf%20Cooperation%20Council">GCC</a> partners of not being genuinely neutral and favoring the <a href="Houthis">Houthi</a> rebels.

Medisize Schweiz

Medisize Schweiz is a Swiss plastics processing company, owned by the Dutch <a href="Philips">Philips</a>-Medisize Corporation. The Medisize Switzerland was original created as Createch AG.

History.
Medisize is a Stock company at Nürnsdorf in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Management: Jürg Wiedler.

Werner Dubach founded the company Createch in <a href="N%C3%BCrensdorf">Nürensdorf</a>, which produced various bottles and closures for the medical, cosmetics and food sector in the injection blow, injection blow streching molding and <a href="injection%20molding">injection molding</a> process. It was planned to build a building consisting of several parts, with office, production and storage space. On the one hand, granting problems, which led to massive changes in the construction project, led to financial problems. In addition, copyright complaints were filed for the production of food-grade food packaging for <a href="Danone">Danone</a> yoghurts and quarks by the toy manufacturer <a href="Lego">Lego</a>. This leads to the bankruptcy of the company Createch and the main building was not completely finished. A part is still in the shell and is used as a warehouse. The Createch was passed on by the <a href="Credit%20Suisse">Credit Suisse</a> Bank until the Dutch Medisize Group took over the company. The Createch was then renamed to Medisize Switzerland AG.
In the meantime Werner Dubach had founded the company [Terxo AG]] in <a href="Wetzikon">Wetzikon</a> with some former Createch employees and the financial commitment of Markus Schellenberg. Werner Dubach had designed and patented a number of closures, some of which are still produced today by Medisize, Terxo and the German Terxo partner company <a href="Bericap">Bericap</a>. Werner Dubach retired some years ago.

Products.
Branch of industry: Plastic industry and packaging industry, food and medical packaging

Medisize Switzerland produces mainly closures for food packaging and cosmetics by means of <a href="injection%20molding%20machines">injection molding machines</a> and injection blowmachines, injection stretch blow molding machines as well as with assembly machines for further processing, but primarily packaging for medical products such as, for example, Eyedrops as well as bottles for drinks.
The Actifit bottles (<a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a>) for the milk processor <a href="Emmi%20AG">Emmi</a>, which produces medisize, have a great competitive pressure. This is because the company Terxo manufactures these bottles for Emmi too. In addition, the injection molding and injection blow molding machine manufacturer Ganahl, who has produced the corresponding tools for Terxo and Medisize, also manufactures such bottles by themselves. This means that there are three companies in the <a href="canton%20of%20Zurich">canton of Zurich</a>, which all supply the same customer with the same product.

Equipment.
Medisize uses injection molding machines of Japanese and German origin. Three Italian machines are available for the injection blow-molding machines, but the majority of injection-molding machines are Jomar machines with vertical plasticizing cylinders, which come from the US. Medisize Switzerland is the first production company to use a fully electric injection blow molding machine. This was developed by a German toolmaking company.

Ntsikana

Ntsikana (born 1780-1821) was a <a href="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> <a href="prophet">prophet</a>, <a href="evangelism">evangelist</a> and hymn writer who is regarded as one of the first Christians to translate <a href="Christian">Christian</a> ideas and concepts into terms understandable to a <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> audience.

Personal Life.
Ntsikana was born around 1780 to Gaba, a councillor to the western ama<a href="Rharhabe">Rharhabe</a> king, <a href="Gaika%20people">Ngqika</a> and his junior wife Nonabe in the Thyume valley, north of <a href="Alice%2C%20Eastern%20Cape">Alice</a>. Ntsikana who belonged to his father's clan, the Cirha clan, was brought up around his mother's kinsmen until he was about five or six. His father sent for him having secured his rights by paying a beast for the child's maintenance since infancy. His father's great wife, Noyiki, who had a daughter but no sons, adopted Ntsikana who therefore became Gaba’s heir. From this time, Ntsikana made the Great Place in the Thyume valley, north of Alice his home. Ntsikana's first contact with <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> coincided with his customary <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> initiation in 1800. In 1799, Johannes van der Kemp, a missionary of the London Missionary Society, arrived among the western ama<a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> and was permitted to set up his camp near to Ngqika’s Great Place. Van der Kemp soon became an attraction both for the king and his people, and in the year that he remained among them they had many opportunities to hear him preach and discuss with him his new teaching. When he left in 1800 van der Kemp could not claim any converts but he may have had an influence on Ntsikana.Ntsikana married two young women, Nontsonta and Nomanto, and settled between the Kat River district and the Peddie district in 1811. Later, he and his family moved to Gqore in the Kate River district. After converting to Christianity, Ntsikana divorced his wife Nomanto. Ntsikana died in Thwatwa in 1821.

Christian work.
From his first contact with Christianity through van der Kemp to 1815 Ntsikana led a normal life. His first spiritual experience was when he was at the kraal looking at his prized ox, Hulushe. As he watched, he saw a patch of light, brighter than ordinary sunlight, illuminating the hide of the animal. Ntsikana asked his companion, a young herdsman for corroboration but the young man denied seeing anything. Later that day, Ntsikana participated in Umdudo (traditional wedding dance). During his performance, a gale-force wind started and when he stopped, it ceased. When he stood up again to dance, the gale-force winds returned with lightning and thunder. Ntsikana did not fully commit to the Christian religion until he met James Read and Joseph Williams who were travelling with Dyani Tshatshu, son of <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> chief from the Buffalo River, near <a href="Fort%20Beaufort">Fort Beaufort</a> on April 1816. Read and Williams offered further scriptural teaching to Ntsikana, before inviting him to travel with them back to <a href="Bethelsdorp">Bethelsdorp</a> when they returned. But such a journey was impossible, neither his chiefs nor the British authorities would allow him to travel into the colony, so the missionaries advised him to remain where he was until Williams could return to establish the new mission station and offer him further instruction. When Williams returned he found Ntsikana had patiently waited for him and had moved his family from Thyume to establish his home in the Mankazana hills, close to where the new mission station was built. Each Saturday, with his complete household, he visited Williams to receive instruction and stayed until Sunday to join in worship. Now a fully converted Christian, Ntsikana divorced one of his wives Nomanto and denounced polygamy. In 1818, Williams passed away, and Ntsikane became the leader, establishing Christian communities in the Mankazana Valley and at Burnshill, Somerset East, Debe Nek, King William’s Town and Mgwali. Ntsikana’s Christian influence touched the lives of leaders such as King Ngqika, and his counsellor, Old Soga, the father of Tiyo Soga, and Tiyo’s older brother, Festiri. 

Conflict between traditional religion & Christianity.
Ntsikana experienced an internal conflict between indigenous belief system (Inkolo yakwaNtu) and the foreign belief system (Inkolo yaseMzini)- <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. As a child he did not agree to be baptised by missionaries but became a Christian leader in life. He also acknowledged that Christianity demanded exclusivity meaning that he had to do away with <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> traditional belief systems. Ntsikana also had a rivalry with <a href="Makhanda">Makhanda</a> who is also known as Nxele, a prophet under chief Ndlambe who was based in the area now known as Grahamstown. Nxele rejected Christianity and western innovations, resisting the arrival of Europeans on the frontier during the Frontier Wars. Nxele called for the worshiping of <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> God, Mdalidiphu, while Ntsikana worshipped Thixo, the god of Christians. Referring to Nxele, Ntsikana once said "uNxele ubuquqekile, ubalahlekisilani abantu?" (Nxele has turned upside down, why does he mislead people?) 

Music.
Ntsikana also composed <a href="Christian">Christian</a> hymns in <a href="Xhosa%20language">isiXhosa</a> which included “Intsimbi” (Ntsikana’s Bell),“Dalibom (Life-Creator), “Ingoma enqukuva” (Round Hymn) and “Ulo Tixomkulu” (“Thou Great God” - the Great Hymn). 

Legacy.
Ntsikana is regarded as one of the first Christians who tried to adapt Christianity to African culture.

Bertrand Auerbach

Bertrand Auerbach (2 September 1856 – 25 August 1942) was a French explorer, anthropologist and geographer.
He published several works on <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, which had a complex mix of ethnic groups and languages in the period before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–18).

Life.
Bertrand Auerbach was born on 2 September 1856 in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, son of Sigismond Auerbach and Julie Borach.
He attended the <a href="%C3%89cole%20normale%20sup%C3%A9rieure">École normale supérieure</a> at rue d'Ulm, Paris.
His schoolmates included the future geographers <a href="Marcel%20Dubois">Marcel Dubois</a> and <a href="Paul%20Dupuy">Paul Dupuy</a>, and the future historians <a href="Georges%20Lacour-Gayet">Georges Lacour-Gayet</a>, <a href="Salomon%20Reinach">Salomon Reinach</a> and <a href="Gustave%20Lanson">Gustave Lanson</a>.
As a student he was known for his gift in languages, with excellent German, good English and Greek, and a knowledge of Hebrew.
He was interested in history at first, and his study of geography under Ernest Desjardins only concerned historical geography.
He was taught by <a href="Paul%20Vidal%20de%20La%20Blache">Paul Vidal de La Blache</a> (1845–1918) who prepared the 3rd year students for their "<a href="agr%C3%A9gation">agrégation</a>" in history and geography.
He does not seem to have been exposed to the teachings of Vidal de la Blache before then.
He received his agrégation in history and geography in 1880.

Auerbach taught in secondary schools in <a href="Bourges">Bourges</a>, <a href="Laval%2C%20Mayenne">Laval</a>, <a href="Belfort">Belfort</a>, <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> and then <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>.
In 1881 he applied for a travel grant and in 1882 asked to be allowed to study for a doctorate. 
In 1883 he was appointed lecturer in Ancient History at <a href="Caen">Caen</a>, and in 1885 was funded to travel in Germany, where he studied the archives of <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>.
Auerbach taught at the Faculty of Arts of the <a href="University%20of%20Nancy">University of Nancy</a> from 1885 to 1926.
In 1885 he was granted his Masters degree in history and geography.
At Nancy he became increasingly interested in geography, and his last historical work appeared in 1889.

In his 1887 thesis, "La diplomatie française et la Cour de Saxe, 1648-1680", Auerbach described the conflicts between Prince Johann Georg's position as a key support of the "true religion" (Lutheranism) and his employment of Italians and Frenchmen, and construction of a theater and a "minature Sistine chapel."
Auerbach married Adèle Alice Hirsch (1866–1946) on 21 March 1888 in Paris.
From January 1893 Auerbach was one of the first professors of geography in France.
The "<a href="Annales%20de%20G%C3%A9ographie">Annales de Géographie</a>" was founded by Vidal de La Blache in 1891.
For three decades Auerbach was part of the group associated with the "Annales de Géographie".
He published an article in the second volume, and submitted an article each year until 1907 under the headings of Alsace-Lorraine and Germany.
He wrote about 600 reports, including about 50 on Alsace-Lorraine, with his last contribution in 1922.

In 1898 Auerbach published a lengthy study of the races and nationalities of Austria-Hungary.
His book tried to define the "national spirit" of the peoples of Austria Hungary.
He noted that Italian-speakers dominated the province of Trieste while the Slovenes were peasants who lived in the mountainous areas, but that did not show that the province should naturally belong to Italy. He stated that Austrian ethnographers had shown "everyday language did not match the mother language, and race did not match nationality."
He concluded that conventional definitions of race and nationality were imprecise, did not help disentangle the complex identities in the region, and were not useful in confirming the political claims of groups of nationalists.

In the fall of 1910 Auerbachs's carefully prepared instructions to France's envoys to the imperial German diet at <a href="Ratisbon">Ratisbon</a> were the subject of heated discussions.

<doc id="54907829" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54907829" title="Bent Bridge">
Bent Bridge

The Bent Bridge or Curved Bridge () is a stone arch bridge over the <a href="K%C4%B1z%C4%B1l%C4%B1rmak">Kızılırmak</a> river southeast of the center of <a href="Sivas">Sivas</a> in <a href="Central%20Anatolia">Central Anatolia</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. The bridge lies in the city's Kardeşler <a href="mahalle">ward</a>, on the road from Sivas to <a href="Malatya">Malatya</a> and onward to <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>.

Historian <a href="Thomas%20Alexander%20Sinclair">Thomas Alexander Sinclair</a> says the bridge was originally built in medieval times, probably by the Seljuk <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Rum">Sultanate of Rum</a> and extensively rebuilt in the late-<a href="Ottoman%20architecture">Ottoman</a> period.

The Bent Bridge consists of 18 stone arches and is long and wide. Traveling from Sivas, the bridge rises from the northern bank of the river and runs almost easterly for across the first six arches. At that point the deck turns 45 degrees to descend southeast for across the remaining 12 arches, the gradient over the final three arches being much steeper. Sinclair relates that one reason to build a bridge with a convex angle towards the river flow may have been to resist the pressure of ice in winter.

All the arches are pointed and most are the same width, except for three especially wide ones. The upstream piers all have stone cutwaters. The parapet has a thick <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">moulding</a> on the outside and is built with holes to allow water to flow off the roadway. Sinclair detects <a href="spolia">spolia</a> (reused stonework) from the <a href="Classical%20architecture">Classical</a> and <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Rum">Anatolian Seljuk</a> periods in the construction of the current bridge. He interprets this as likely to indicate that the original bridge was built by the Seljuks and included some material from an earlier building of the Classical era. The current bridge was then rebuilt using material from the Seljuk bridge. Assuming the bridge was constructed by the Seljuks, that would date it to a 69-year period between the conquest of Sivas by the Seljuk Sultan <a href="Kilij%20Arslan%20II">Kilij Arslan II</a> in 1174, and the city's capture by the <a href="Ilkhanid">Ilkhanid</a> Mongol commander <a href="Baiju">Baiju</a>, following the <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%B6se%20Da%C4%9F">Battle of Köse Dağ</a> on 26 June 1243.

The bridge is known to have been repaired in 1585 during the reign of <a href="Murad%20III">Sultan Murad III</a>. A construction inventory held in the <a href="Sivas%20Congress%20and%20Ethnography%20Museum">Sivas Congress and Ethnography Museum</a> also notes that the bridge was repaired in , and other records point to 19th-century repairs under the patronage of Sivas Governor <a href="Halil%20Rifat%20Pasha">Halil Rifat Pasha</a> and at the direction of the <a href="Agha%20%28title%29">agha</a> of <a href="Kangal">Kangal</a>, Abdurrahman Pasha. Halil Rifat Pasha was <a href="vali">governor</a> of Sivas from 1882 to 1885. 

The <a href="Turkish%20Ministry%20of%20Culture%20and%20Tourism">Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism</a> added the bridge to its national inventory of cultural heritage on 21 January 1983. It was restored by the 16th Region of the <a href="General%20Directorate%20of%20Highways%20%28Turkey%29">Highways Directorate</a> in 2006, as a result of which the stone appears unusually pale and new. Since the construction of a modern road bridge about upstream, the Bent Bridge is open only to pedestrian traffic.

<doc id="54907868" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54907868" title="Awkward &amp; Depressed">
Awkward &amp; Depressed

Awkward & Depressed is the third studio album by <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> comedian <a href="Jarrod%20Alonge">Jarrod Alonge</a>, released under the moniker of his fictitious <a href="emo">emo</a> band Canadian Softball, on July 28, 2017. The album primarily satirizes and parodies tropes found in the <a href="emo">emo</a> genre, primarily from the early 2000s emo revival. The album directly parodies bands such as <a href="American%20Football%20%28band%29">American Football</a>, <a href="Modern%20Baseball">Modern Baseball</a>, <a href="Hawthorne%20Heights">Hawthorne Heights</a> and <a href="Hotel%20Books">Hotel Books</a>. The album also features a cover of "Seven" by <a href="Sunny%20Day%20Real%20Estate">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>, a first for Alonge.

Background.
Similar to Alonge's previous releases, "Awkward & Depressed" was crowdfunded through an <a href="Indiegogo">Indiegogo</a> campaign, which raised over $26,000. The album and crowfunding campaign were announced on March 10 with the release of the "Fund Me" music video. Campaign perks included a signed poster, a CD and digital download of the album, a T-shirt and hat, and a wall flag. While recording the album, Alonge released the EPs "Covers, Vol. 1" and "No Words Spoken" by his non-comedic <a href="post-hardcore">post-hardcore</a> project CrazyEightyEight. 

On July 7, 2017, Alonge released an official trailer for the album, revealing a 13-song track list with a sample for each song. The trailer revealed that the album would contain a cover of <a href="Sunny%20Day%20Real%20Estate">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>'s "Seven" along with <a href="Hotel%20Books">Hotel Books</a> providing guest vocals on the song "Cut the Chord." "Your Validation" was the first song to be released from the album, with the music video premiering on YouTube on July 14. A lyric video for the song "Ohio Is Emo Kids" was released on July 21. The album's second music video, "Great Again," was released on July 27, a day before the album's release. 

Music and lyrics.
The album's first track, "Average Joe," mimics emo bands' tendency to write songs about being an "average person" and complaining about being unpopular despite being signed to a record label and having many fans. In reference to the song, Alonge stated that he was "essentially just a poor man's <a href="Bert%20McCracken">Bert McCracken</a>." The song "Your Validation" is a parody of <a href="Modern%20Baseball">Modern Baseball</a> with the song's name referencing their song "Your Graduation" from the album "<a href="You%27re%20Gonna%20Miss%20It%20All">You're Gonna Miss It All</a>". The song describes various scene phases a person goes through with the music video showing pictures of fellow YouTube comedian/musician Jared Dines going through a <a href="straight%20edge">straight edge</a> phase, an <a href="Electronic%20dance%20music">EDM</a> phase, and a <a href="Goths">goth</a> phase, among others. The next song, "Mathematical," is a parody of <a href="American%20Football%20%28band%29">American Football</a> and <a href="math%20rock">math rock</a> with the song featuring many time and tempo changes. The song becomes more chaotic as it goes on before Alonge stops it and refers to it as "musical gibberish."

Kennedy</a>, <a href="James%20Garfield">James Garfield</a>, and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. "Ohio Is for Emo Kids" is a medley consisting of snippets of twenty different songs.

Steve Cohen (author)

Steve Cohen is an American author, publishing entrepreneur, and attorney. His articles, mostly opinion pieces, appear regularly in Forbes , The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, City Journal Time Magazine, and more. He is the author or co-author of seven books, including three best-sellers. His early career included stints at Time and Scholastic, before becoming an entrepreneur. He co-chaired the Clinton White House literacy task force “Prescription for Reading Partnership,” and served on the Boards of Reach Out and Read and the United States Naval Institute. At age 58 he went to law school, and is currently an attorney in New York City. 

Early Life and Education.
Steve grew up in Lynbrook, New York and was appointed to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis by Congressman Allard Lowenstein. Steve attended the Academy for nearly three years, then transferred to Brown University under the GI Bill. He graduated in 1975, with a concentration in Public Policy. He was a class marshal, a Rhodes Scholarship state finalist, and was one of two student representatives to the University’s Board of Trustees. In 2013, he graduated cum laude from New York Law School, and is admitted to practice in New York.

Career.
Early in his career, Steve worked for the Governor of Rhode Island, for the New York State Senate, and for several advertising agencies. He was also on Ronald Reagan’s national campaign staff in the 1980 Presidential race, where he wrote and produced television commercials and print ads. "Podium" and "No More" were Ads made for the 1980 Reagan campaign. His “Flip-flop” and “Surprised” commercials are in the Museum of the Moving Image collection of classic political advertising. 
For nearly seven years Steve worked for Time Inc. where he held marketing positions, and created and produced the Time Man of the Year television documentaries. With James Rich he created “Covermaker,” one of the first widely-used educational computer software programs; and he was creator and publisher of the Time College Achievement Awards. 

Steve spent two years as a vice president with Playboy, and won two Clio awards for best radio and television advertising campaigns. His invitation to CNBC to bring television cameras into the Playboy offices as a half-dozen top advertising agencies competed for the Playboy account resulted in an insightful half-hour documentary on business decision-making.

For nine years Steve was then a Managing Director at Scholastic, the children’s publishing company. He was responsible for creating and managing several businesses including Parent & Child Magazine, the Parent Bookshelf, and the Everything You Always Wanted to Know About….(Kindergarten, First Grade, Second Grade) book series. His proudest accomplishment at Scholastic was the print-on-demand, multi-lingual book series he created for the Reach Out and Read literacy project.

Steve left Scholastic to become CEO of several internet start-ups including 4-to-14/Brainquest.com; Living Independently/Quietcare (sold to General Electric;) and MultiMedicus/The Child Health Guide – developed in cooperation with Harvard and Dartmouth Medical Schools.

Since 1983, Steve has been an adjunct professor and NYU and Fordham, as well as a guest lecturer at his alma matter, Brown and various other schools, including Dartmouth, Columbia, Stanford and many of the SUNY schools.

As a Contributing Author.
Beginning in 1976, Steve began writing articles for magazines and Newspapers. He has written – most on issues of public policy – for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Sun, The New York Observer, Forbes, Bloomberg View, The Daily Beast, City Journal, The Naval Institute Proceedings, Inside Higher Education, The Chronicle of Higher Education, The Brown Alumni Magazine, and Mademoiselle – among others. He may be the only person to have had two different Op-Ed articles in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal on the same day. (March 20, 2014.)

Books.
He has written or co-authored six books, several of which have been award-winning best-sellers: 

Getting In! -- with Paulo DeOliveira (Workman 1983) 

Getting to the Right Job – with Paulo DeOliveira (Workman 1987)
