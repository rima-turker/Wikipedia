Type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells)

Type 1 regulatory cells (Tr 1 cells) are a class of regulatory T cells participating in peripheral immunity as a subsets of CD4+ <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>s . Tr1 cells can be self or non-self antigen specific and their key role is to induce and maintain peripheral tolerance and suppress tissue inflammation in autoimmunity and graft vs. host disease.

Characterization and surface molecules.
The characteristic cell-surface markers for Tr1 cells in humans and mice were identified as CD4 CD49bLAG-3 CD226 from which LAG-3 and CD49b are indispensable. LAG-3 is a membrane protein in Tr1 cells with a negative regulatory effect on <a href="T-cell%20receptor">TCR</a>-mediated signal transduction in human and mouse cells. When it becomes a soluble molecule, LAG-3 activates <a href="dendritic%20cell">dendritic cell</a>s (DCs) and enhances the <a href="antigen">antigen</a>-specific T-cell response in mice, which is necessary for Tr1 cells antigen specifity. CD49b belongs to the integrin family and is a receptor for many (extracellular) matrix and non-matrix molecules. CD49b provides little contribution to the differentiation and function of Tr1 cells.

They characteristically produce high levels of IL-10, IFNy, IL-5 and also TGF- β but no IL-4 nor IL-2 Production of IL-10 is also much more rapid then its production of other <a href="T%20helper%20cell">T-helper</a> cell types.

Tr1 cells do not constitutively express <a href="FOXP3">FOXP3</a> but only transiently, upon their activation and in smaller amounts then <a href="CD25%2B">CD25</a> FOXP3 regulatory cells. FOXP3 is not required for Tr1 induction nor for its function"." They also express repressor of <a href="GATA3">GATA-3</a> (ROG), while CD25 FOXP3 regulatory cells do not. ROG then dowregulates GATA-3, a characteristic transcription factor for <a href="Th2%20cell">Th2 cell</a>s.

Tr1 cells express high levels of regulatory factors, such as glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (<a href="GITR">GITR</a>), <a href="OX40">OX40</a> (<a href="CD134">CD134</a>), and tumor-necrosis factor receptor (<a href="TNFRSF9">TNFRSF9</a>). Resting human Tr1 cells express Th1 assosiated <a href="chemokine%20receptor">chemokine receptor</a>s CXCR3 and <a href="CCR5">CCR5</a>, and Th2-associated CCR3, <a href="CCR4">CCR4</a> and <a href="CCR8%20%28gene%29">CCR8</a>. Upon activation, Tr1 cells migrate preferentially in response to I-309, a ligand for CCR8.

Mechanism of Tr1-mediated suppression.
The suppressing and tolerance-inducing effect of Tr1 cells is mediated mainly by cytokines. The other mechanism as cell to cell contact, modulation of dendritic cells, metabolic disruption and cytolysis is however also available to them. In vivo Tr1 cells need to be activated, to be able to exert their regulatory effects.

Tr1 cells secrete large amount of suppressing cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β. IL-10 directly inhibits T cells by blocking its production of IL-2, IFNy and GM-CSF and have tolerogenic effect on <a href="B%20cell">B cell</a>s and support differentiation of other <a href="regulatory%20T%20cell">regulatory T cell</a>s. IL-10 indirectly downregulates MHC II molecules and co-stimulatory molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and force them to upregulate tolerogenic molecules such as ILT-3, ILT-4 and HLA-G. 
Type 1 regulatory T cells poses inhibitory receptor CTLA-4 through which they exert suppressor function.
Tr1 cells can express ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 and are suspected of generating adenosine which suppresses effector T cell proliferation and their cytokine production in vitro.
Tr1 cells can both express Granzyme A and granzyme B. It was shown recently, that Tr1 cells, in vitro and also ex vivo, specifically lyse cells of <a href="Myeloid%20progenitor%20cells">myeloid</a> origin, but not other APC or T or B lymphocytes. Cytolysis indirectly suppresses immune response by reducing numbers of myeloid-origin antigen presenting cells.

Differentiation.
Tr 1 cells are inducible, arising from precursors naive T cells. They can be differentiated ex vivo and in vivo. The ways of Tr1 cells induction in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro differ and also envelope many different approaches but the molecular mechanism, till this day, appears to be conserved.

IL-27, together with TGF-β induces IL-10–producing regulatory T cells with Tr1-like properties cells. IL-27 alone can induce IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, but in the absence of TGF-β, the cells produce large quantities of both IFN-γ and IL-10. IL-6 and IL-21 also plays a role in differentiation as they regulate expression of transcription factors necessary for IL-10 production, which is believed to start up the differentiation itself later on.

Proposed transcription biomarkers for type 1 regulatory cells differentiation are:
Expression of these transcriptional factors are driven by IL-6 in IL-21 and IL-2 dependant manner.

Clinical manifestation and application.
Tr1 cells possess huge clinical potential in means to prevent, block and even cure several T cells mediated diseases, including <a href="Graft-versus-host%20disease">GvHD</a>, allograft rejection, autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory diseases. The first successful tests were performed on mouse models and on humans as well.

Transplantation research has shown, that donor cells producing IL-10 in response to recipient alloantigens, was found to correlate with the absence of GvHD after bone marrow transplantation, while decreased numbers markedly associated with severe GvHD. Decreased levels of IL-10 CD4+ producing cells were also observed in inflamed synovium and peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Phase I/II of clinical trials of Tr1 cell treatment concerning Crohn's disease have been successful and appear to be safe and do not lead to a general immune suppression.

Jasmina Cibic

Jasmina Cibic (born in <a href="Ljubljana">Ljubljana</a> in 1979) is a Slovenian performance, installation and film artist who lives and works in London. Her work often explores the construction of national cultures, their underlying ideologies, political goals and uses, as well as the soft power of the arts, particularly architecture.

Art career.
Cibic studied at the <a href="Accademia%20di%20Belle%20Arti%20di%20Venezia">Accademia di Bella Arti</a> in Venice, and then took a Masters in Fine Art at <a href="Goldsmiths%2C%20University%20of%20London">Goldsmiths</a> in London, graduating in 2006.

In 2013, Cibic represented <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> in its Pavilion at the 55th <a href="Venice%20Biennale">Venice Biennale</a>, with a project entitled 'For Our Economy and Culture'. This included two films shot at officlal state locations, One, "Framing the Space," was shot at <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josep Broz Tito</a>'s residence at Lake Bled, where he received royalty and other dignitaries, and dramatised a conversation between state architect <a href="Vinko%20Glanz">Vinko Glanz</a> and a journalist about the uses of national architecture. The other, "The Fruit of Our Lands," recreated a Yugoslav parliamentary debate held in 1957 to discuss which artworks might be suitable to 'decorate' the newly built People's Assembly (now the <a href="National%20Assembly%20Building%20of%20Slovenia">National Assembly Building of Slovenia</a>), designed and built between 1954 and 1959 by Glanz. Cibic told "Aesthetica" that she found the transcript of this debate - which her film re-enacted word-for-word, and played on a continuous loop - 'in a dank garage within a shopping trolley filled with the archives of the former Yugoslav state architect', and that she had not found any record of it in official state archives.

"Spielraum: The Nation Loves It" (2015), which featured a woman practicising a speech to launch a new 'ambitious building programme', also used found dialogue but removed specific names from speeches, referring instead to 'the artist' or 'our country'. The final part of her "Spielraum" trilogy, "Tear Down and Rebuild" (2015) was filmed inside the Modernist interior of the former <a href="Palace%20of%20Serbia">Palace of the Federation</a> building (now the Palace of Serbia) in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, using quotations pulled from speeches by <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a>, <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> and others, as well as architectural theory and Yugoslav debates, for its dialogue.

"The Pavilion" (2015) was a short, experimental documentary about the (Serbian, Croatian and Slovene) <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>'s Pavilion for the <a href="1929%20Barcelona%20International%20Exposition">1929 Barcelona International Exposition</a>. The Yugoslav entry, designed by Serbian modernist architect <a href="Dragi%C5%A1a%20Bra%C5%A1ovan">Dragiša Brašovan</a>, supposedly won the Grand Prix and then lost it to <a href="Ludwig%20Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a>'s design for Germany due to political intrigue. In the video, a narrator described Cibic's methods to retrace the lost Pavilion, which was torn down after the end of <a href="Expo%20%2729">Expo '29</a>, as five performers built a model of Brašovan's star-shaped building in 1:7 scale.

History.
Selima Salaun was raised in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> and <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> before attending school and becoming an opticienne-lunetière (licensed as optician, optometrist, and optical artisan) in France. After working in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> for Royale Optique and <a href="Alain%20Mikli">Alain Mikli</a>, Salaun landed in New York City to manage Mikli’s first New York store. After falling in love with New York City she decided to forego launching Mikli’s first store in Japan to open her own boutique in her favorite neighborhood, opening the first Selima Optique in 1993 on the corner of Wooster and Broome in <a href="SoHo%2C%20Manhattan">Soho</a>. The Optique began fulfilling custom orders with a French atelier when a friend (Hubert Kriegel of the Timeless Ride) asked if Selima could make him a “funkier” version of the iconic “<a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a>” frame. After <a href="Barneys%20New%20York">Barney’s</a> president bought herself a few of Selima’s customs, the store asked to carry a full Selima Optique collection and, with some wholesale guidance from Barneys, the first official Selima Optique brand collection was produced and sold through a first-of-its-kind shop-in-shop at Barneys New York in 1996.Since 1996 the company has expanded with retail locations and wholesale accounts across the world and into different industries as well. In the 2000s there was Selima’s trendy Soho lingerie store “Le Corset,” vintage French-inspired luxury lingerie shopped by New Yorkers and worn by <a href="Emma%20Bunton">Baby Spice</a> in the <a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone Magazine</a>. And in 2009 there was “Hats by Selima Atelier,” a collection of eclectic hats created with partner Virginie Promeyrat and notably shopped by <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>. Now, Selima Optique has retail locations in New York, <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, and Paris, France and its collection is wholesaled across the globe. The brand has collaborated with the likes of <a href="Jack%20Spade">Jack Spade</a> and J.Crew, and more recently with NBA MVP Russell Westbrook, style icon Iris Apfel, and New York’s <a href="Neue%20Galerie%20New%20York">Neue Galerie</a> . Personally, Selima Salaun has helped mentor designers like Darylynn and <a href="Coco%20%26amp%3B%20Breezy">Coco & Breezy</a> while sitting on the <a href="Council%20of%20Fashion%20Designers%20of%20America">Council of Fashion Designers of America</a>’s board and recently helping found the C.F.D.A.’s latest branch: the Eyewear Designers of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (efCFDA).

Movement for a Democratic Military

The Movement for a Democratic Military (MDM) was an antiwar and GI rights organization during the Vietnam War. Initially formed in late 1969 as a merger of sailors from San Diego and marines from the <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Pendleton">Camp Pendleton Marine Base</a> in Oceanside, CA, it rapidly spread to a number of other cities and bases in California and the mid-West, including San Francisco, Long Beach Naval Station, El Toro Marine Air Station, Fort Ord, Fort Carson and the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. Heavily influenced by the Black Panther Party and the Black militancy of the times., it became one of the more radical GI organizations during that era and was investigated in 1971 by the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Internal%20Security">House Committee on Internal Security</a> (formally HUAC). As with much of the GI movement during this era, chapters had a high turnover as members were transferred, discharged and disciplined by the military. By late 1970 several chapters had splintered or disbanded, but the group’s name and demands proved popular within the GI resistance movement overall. Some chapters continued through 1971 and 1972 and one until 1975.

Founding.
MDM started at the civilian supported "Green Machine" antiwar coffeehouse in Vista, CA not far from Camp Pendleton. It began as a merger of a small group of sailors in San Diego called <a href="GI%27s%20Against%20Fascism">GI's Against Fascism</a> and a larger group of marines at Camp Pendleton. The San Diego group already had a newspaper called "Duck Power" and the marines began by publishing a newspaper called "Attitude Check" whose first issue, dated November 1, 1969, announced that it was “written by marines and ex-marines for the benefit of the common snuffy, grunt, and em.” The organization seemed to hit a nerve among local marines and sailors and on December 14th in nearby Oceanside an estimated 1,000 Black, White and Chicano GIs were among 4,000 who participated in an antiwar march and rally with speeches by <a href="Donald%20W.%20Duncan">Donald W. Duncan</a>, <a href="Captain%20Howard%20Levy">Captain Howard Levy</a>, <a href="Angela%20Davis">Angela Davis</a> and a number of active duty GIs.

Preamble and 12 Demands.
At this rally, MDM’s spokespeople presented and explained the organization's Preamble and 12 Demands, which had also been published simultaneously in the December 1, 1970 issues of "Duck Power" and "Attitude Check". The Preamble stated “that ending the suppression of the American serviceman is an important part of a larger struggle for basic human rights” and pledged “support for the self-determination of all peoples.” It ended, “We have been silent for a long time. We will be silent no longer.”

The 12 demands included: An immediate end to the Vietnam War, collective bargaining for GIs, "human and constitutional rights [for] military men and women," the ending of censorship and intimidation within the military, the abolition of "mental and physical cruelty in military brigs, correctional custodies, and basic training”, doing away with the "court-martial and non-judicial punishment systems," "wages equal to the federal minimum wage," "the abolition of the class structure of the military," an end to "all racism everywhere," the freeing of all political prisoners, including Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton," an end to "the glorification of war," and the abolition of the draft.

Spread.
San Diego.
The pre-existing group of sailors in San Diego called "GI's Against Fascism" merged with the group at Camp Pendleton. They all agreed to use the MDM name while publishing two newspapers, "Duck Power" in San Diego and "Attitude Check" at Pendleton. In mid-1970 the San Diego chapter changed the name of their newspaper to "Dare to Struggle" which they continued to publish until mid-1971. "Attitude Check’s" last issue was in June 1970. The Camp Pendleton and San Diego areas were very pro-military and the MDM members located there experienced significant hostility and harassment. The San Diego area MDM had close ties with the <a href="San%20Diego%20Free%20Press">San Diego Free Press</a> which helped them put out their newspapers.

Great Lakes Naval Station.
By early 1970 MDM had spread to several other cities and military bases. In January, a chapter formed at the <a href="Naval%20Station%20Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> naval base, located north of Chicago, IL, the largest U.S. Navy training base and the only boot camp for naval enlistees. Aided by activists with the Wisconsin Draft Resistance and the Chicago Area Military Project, a counseling service and coffeehouse, this chapter was one of the most active and included a considerable number of black sailors. They began publishing the "The Navy Times Are Changing" which continued until the end of 1972. On Armed Forces Day in May 1970 they sponsored a rally near the base which attracted 50 sailors and nearly 500 civilians. Another rally in September of that same year “drew a crowd of over five hundred sailors and civilians.” When four Black WAVES were illegally arrested by base commanders in July 1970, more than 100 sailors marched to where the women were being held and surrounded the building, refusing to move until the women were released. Within weeks of this incident, over 900 enlisted men and women were discharged or transferred to other bases by the navy. On Armed Forces Day in 1972, MDM and the Chicago Area Military Project organized a large demonstration with 400 GIs joining a crowd of over 2,000.

San Francisco Bay Area.
Tom Csekey, one of the sailors who founded "GI’s Against Fascism" in San Diego traveled to San Francisco and helped form two chapters of MDM in the Bay Area. There was a short-lived chapter at <a href="Fort%20Ord">Fort Ord</a> near Monterey, CA which published the "Right-On Post" from May to August 1970. And a San Francisco Bay Area chapter with members from the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Alameda">Alameda Naval Air Station</a>, <a href="Treasure%20Island%2C%20San%20Francisco">Treasure Island, San Francisco</a> and other military bases, which published their newspaper "Up Against the Bulkhead" regularly from 1970 to 1972 and then sporadically until to 1975. The "Up Against the Bulkhead" paper and staff played an important role in helping sailors from the organize a November 6, 1971 antiwar demonstration in San Francisco involving over 300 men from the ship. This chapter was the longest lasting MDM organization and their newspaper was one of the more professional and widely distributed.

El Toro Marine Air Base.
In July 1970 another chapter formed at the <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20El%20Toro">El Toro Marine air base</a> in Orange County, CA. They published a newspaper called "Pay Back" consistently until the end of 1970 and then sporadically for another year.

Fort Carson.
In mid-1970 a group of GI from the <a href="Fort%20Carson">Fort Carson</a> army base near Colorado Springs, CO began to meet and publish a newspaper called "Counter Attack". They were supported by the "Homefront" GI coffeehouse. As with all the other chapters, they experienced a high turnover rate and disbanded by mid-1971.

Rules.
MDM was more disciplined than most other GI resistance organizations of the period. At a June 1970 regional conference involving chapters from Camp Pendleton, San Diego, the Bay Area, Fort Ord, Long Beach, and El Toro the members approved 16 strict "Rules for MDM Members". These included no narcotics or marijuana, no racism, no male chauvinism or sexism, no criminal activity or stealing from the people, putting the interests and needs of the people before personal pleasure, mandatory participation in political education classes, no misuse of funds, and instructions that if arrested members were to give only name, rank, and serial number.

Controversy.
Some critics of MDM have argued that their 12 demands, if implemented "would have rendered the U.S. military totally ineffective as a fighting force." In an interview in January 1971 in The Marine Corps Gazette, Marine commandant general <a href="Leonard%20F.%20Chapman%20Jr.">Leonard F. Chapman Jr.</a> said MDM was “a serious threat to the defense of this country.” 

House Internal Security Committee.
The House Committee on Internal Security investigated MDM and the broader GI movement. They concluded that the GI Movement “is the organized efforts by relatively small numbers of GIs and pseudo pacifist civilians to enlist and engage the participation by United States armed services personnel in the so-called peace movement.” A witness before the committee described MDM’s efforts at Fort Ord as follows: “The general purpose of the MDM was to recruit soldiers, to propagandize them, to encourage them to file for conscientious objector status, to hold demonstrations enlisting their sympathy against the Army and the establishment, to conduct…certain operations aimed at distributing propaganda literature upon the military reservation illegally, and to disrupt in general and neutralize the effectiveness of Fort Ord as a military training base.”

Other Views.
Other observers agreed that MDM was on the more radical end of the GI movement but were more favorable. One scholar observed that MDM viewed “the war in a much broader context of military and social oppression that MDM hoped to eradicate. For many groups on the Left, ending the Vietnam conflict was a liberal issue in comparison to the more revolutionary goal of transforming American society. For members of the armed forces facing the prospect of combat in Southeast Asia, ending the war was a critical issue. The MDM demands, framed as they were in broad social and political terms, reflect a strong Left political influence on at least some of the GI antiwar groups.” The "Stanford Daily" viewed MDM as a lifeline to the GIs: “These men have already suffered the dehumanization process of boot camp and many of them are being prepared for Viet Nam. They were living a nightmare of which there was little relief until MDM developed.”

Radicalism.
MDM itself was quite upfront with its radicalism. As the August 1970 "Right-on Post" newspaper published at Fort Ord put it: “The goal of MDM as an organization is to educate GIs to the real causes of their oppression, and to help them move to put an end to the problem. Through a black-brown-white coalition, we will educate one another, struggle together and defend one another. Rising as one, with clenched fists, we will break the man's chains. We are not afraid of the man's stockades; we've been there. The Vietnamese freedom fighters have shown us the way: a united force of brothers and sisters determined to free themselves can defeat the U.S. military monster.”

Harassment and Attacks.
Several of the MDM chapters and their affiliated GI coffeehouses experienced legal and non-legal harassment from the pro-military towns where they were located and even violent attacks from right-wing organizations. In one instance, the "Green Machine" coffeehouse near Camp Pendleton was shot up on April 29, 1970 with 45 caliber machine gun fire, wounding one of the marines inside in the shoulder. A clandestine paramilitary right-wing group called the Secret Army Organization was suspected. Another involved the San Diego Chapter on February 8, 1970. According to the lawyer and author Mark Lane, the San Diego Police and Navy Shore Patrol "smashed down the door of a San Diego store front…to break up a peaceful meeting of Marines, Sailors and civilians." This was preceded by "several hours of terror on the streets in the vicinity by the local and military police during which civilians were threatened and detained by the cops and GI's were taken into custody, physically pushed around and finally arrested on non-existent charges."

Legacy.
MDM may have been the most radical of the GI antiwar and military resistance organizations of significant size during the Vietnam War. It has been estimated that they had between five thousand and ten thousand members and they had viable chapters in over half-a-dozen military bases and cities. Their stand against the Vietnam War, their call for self-determination of all peoples and their opposition to discrimination and racism proved popular with a segment of GI, particularly minority GIs, as was the idea of democratizing the military. The military considered them a serious threat. With the transfer and discharge of many of its most active members, chapters were hard to sustain and by the end of the Vietnam War, MDM's last remaining chapter dissolved.

Headstart (company)

Headstart is a recruiting platform that uses <a href="Machine%20Learning">Machine Learning</a>, contextual and predictive algorithms specifically, to help companies identify the best-suited candidates in the shortest amount of time and match students with best-fit job opportunities at a large range of companies. 

In 2017, Headstart was ranked one of the most disruptive companies in the UK by Real Business. 

The Headstart Process.
Headstart uses machine learning and psychographic analysis to replace the Resume Screen, through allowing students to build a profile, a detailed 'fingerprint', in less than 20 minutes. This 'fingerprint' displays personality, interests, skills, CV data and preferences. The Headstart Applicant Matching System (AMS) then maps that onto the hiring criteria of hundreds of companies, by integrating with existing corporate recruitment systems, and predicts the suitability of the candidates, whilst using machine learning algorithms to learn from hiring data. It then recommends the best-fit job opportunities for candidates, and creates a ranked list of candidates for each company, taking into consideration culture and job role criteria. 

The AMS allows candidates to connect with businesses, big and small, through a simple, personalised, re-usable application form, helping companies move away from experience/qualification driven screening, towards a more inclusive, effective process that considers personality, behaviours, strengths and motivations as well.

Nick found the majority of application forms unrepresentative and time-consuming; he realised that he was constantly trying to fit in with his anticipation of how a company would like him to be, as opposed to filling out the form with an accurate representation of his personality and interests. Jeremy felt a similar frustration, leaving university with a highly-desirable degree in Neuroscience having originally wanted to go into medicine. He had been coding for 8 years and was running a 35,000 WAU minecraft community. He had no idea what he could do given the disparity between his qualifications and his skills, and needed a platform like Headstart to show him some direction. 

In June 2017, Headstart received seed funding from <a href="Y%20Combinator%20%28company%29">Y Combinator</a>, a start-up accelerator.

John Mayor (brewer)

John Mayor (1735-1817) was an English brewer and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1774 and 1782. He was the first superintendent of <a href="HMSO">HM Stationery Office</a> from 1786.

Mayor was the son of John Mayor, a brass founder, of Little Moorfields, London. He became a brewer in London and owned extensive property at <a href="Langtons%20House">Langtons House</a> near Hornchurch Essex. He also acquired Lacy Court near Abingdon and became involved politically there. In February 1774 he became <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Berkshire">High Sheriff of Berkshire</a> and in the <a href="British%20general%20election%2C%201774">British general election, 1774</a>, he was elected <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Abingdon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Abingdon</a>. His opponent petitioned against Mayor being returned while serving as sheriff. The election was declared void in March 1775 but having completed his term as Sheriff, Mayor was re-elected on 11 March. He was re-elected in the <a href="British%20general%20election%2C%201780">1780 election</a> but for unknown reasons he vacated his seat in December 1782. Mayor’s only parliamentary speeches were in opposing a tax on malt. He had however rendered assistance to the Inland Revenue, particularly regarding the tax on paper. He was rewarded with a pension of £1,000. 

Mayor was asked to submit to the Treasury a plan for controlling the supply of government stationery and in 1786 this resulted in the establishment of <a href="HMSO">HM Stationery Office</a> of which he became the first superintendent.

Mayor remained in office until 1799 and died on 23 September 1817.

NGC 5617

NGC 5617 is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> in the constellation <a href="Centaurus%20%28constellation%29">Centaurus</a>. NGC 5617 forms a binary open cluster with Trumpler 22. It lies one degree west-northwest of <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a>.

Observation history.
It was discovered by <a href="James%20Dunlop">James Dunlop</a> in 1826. He descripted it on May 8, 1826 as "a cluster of small stars of mixed magnitudes, considerably congregated towards the centre, 4' or 5' in diametre" and added it to his catalog as number 302. <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> descripted as "Class IV object, very rich; irregularly round; pretty much compressed in the middle but scattered at borders; 15'; there are three stars of 10th magnitude, 5 or 6 stars of 11th magnitude; the rest below 11th" and added it to General Catalogue as No. 3570. In the <a href="New%20General%20Catalogue">New General Catalogue</a> it is descripted as "large (10'), richer in stars to the west (about 80 total), with a compressed middle. It contains stars of magnitude 8 and fainter."

Characteristics.
NGC 5617 is located nearly 2 kpc (6.500 light years) away from Earth, at the further border of <a href="Carina-Sagittarius%20arm">Carina-Sagittarius arm</a>. Various <a href="Photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometric studies</a> have yield different results concerning the age and the distance of the cluster; Moffat & Vogt (1975) studied and calculated a distance of 1.34 kpc from the Sun, Haug (1978) found its distance to be 1.82 kpc, a <a href="Charge-coupled%20device">CCD</a> photometry by Kjeldsen & Frandsen (1991) found the distance to be 2.05 ± 0.2 kpc and the age 70 Myr and Carra & Munari (2004) used BVI photometry to obtain reddening EB−V= 0.48 ± 0.05, age of 80 Myr, and a distance of 2.0 ± 0.3 kpc. De Silva et al. (2015) calculated its distance at 2.1 ± 0.3 kpc.

There are 175 probable member stars within the angular radius of the cluster and 65 within the central part of the cluster. The tidal radius of the cluster is 7.4 - 10.2 parsecs (24 - 33 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 5617, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. One <a href="blue%20straggler">blue straggler</a> is possible member of the cluster. Possible members of the cluster are also a <a href="delta%20Scuti%20variable">delta Scuti variable</a>, a <a href="gamma%20Doradus%20variable">gamma Doradus variable</a> and <a href="eclipsing%20variable%20star">eclipsing variable star</a>s.

Relation with Trumpler 22.
NGC 5617 appears to be gravitationally bound to Trumpler 22. The two clusters share similar radial velocities (-38.63 ± 2.25 km/s for NGC 5617 and -38.46 ± 2.08 km/s for Trumpler 22), mean <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> (-0.18 ± 0.02 for NGC 5617 and-0.17 ± 0.04 for Trumpler 22), similar <a href="Abundance%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">abundances</a> across various elements, and have similar age, forming a primordial binary cluster pair. Their orbits were initially almost circular and their separation less than 20 pc.

Marcelle Gauvreau

Marcelle Gauvreau (28 February 1907 – 16 December 1968) was a Canadian <a href="botanist">botanist</a> who took a special interest in <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a> education for children. She founded a school to encourage young naturalists and published in both scientific journals and the popular press.

Family and education.
Marcelle Gauvreau was born in <a href="Rimouski">Rimouski</a>, Quebec, to Joseph Gauvreau, a physician, and Augustine L'Arrivée. When Marcelle was two, her father became registrar of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Quebec in Montreal, and the family moved to that city. Marcelle was the aunt and godmother of the filmmaker <a href="Claude%20Jutra">Claude Jutra</a>.

Gauvreau received her early education at the Saint-Urbain Academy, Boulevard Academy, and the convent of Mont-Sainte-Marie. When she was ten, she came down with <a href="polio">polio</a>, which left her with a weak leg and caused her to miss half a year of schooling. In 1924, at the age of 17, she contracted tuberculosis, which left her with health issues for the rest of her life.

Gauvreau attended the <a href="University%20of%20Montreal">University of Montreal</a> for one year (1929-30). In 1930, the newspaper "<a href="Le%20Devoir">Le Devoir</a>", encouraged by the prominent botanist <a href="Marie-Victorin%20Kirouac">Marie-Victorin Kirouac</a>, launched a botanical contest. Gauvreau, who had already begun developing an interest in botany, entered the contest with a <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a>, which was considered excellent by the contest judges but excluded from the prizes because Gauvreau was then enrolled in the arts and philosophy division of the university rather than the natural sciences. The following year, Gauvreau moved over to the Botanical Institute for further study under Kirouac, who considered her one of the most brilliant students in the school. She got her degree in botany in 1932, and a degree in natural sciences the following year. 

During this same period, she worked in the Botanical Institute library, and she earned a degree in library science from <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a> in 1935.

In 1933, she began graduate work on the <a href="marine%20algae">marine algae</a> of the <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20River">St. Lawrence River</a> under Jules Brunel. She obtained her M.S. in 1939, and her thesis was published in 1956. During her graduate studies, she also completed an exhaustive bibliography of Kirouac's writings and worked on the glossary and index of his magnum opus, "La flore laurentienne" (The Laurentian Flora), the first comprehensive record of all plant species indigenous to southern Quebec.

Career.
Circles of Young Naturalists.
In the 1930s, Gauvreau became involved with a new organization, the Circles of Young Naturalists (CYN), founded to encourage young scientists and supported by the Canadian Society for Natural History (CSNH). In 1932, she became the editor of a weekly chronicle of CYN activities published in the youth magazine "L'Oiseau bleu". She continued there until the magazine folded in 1940. Between 1938 and 1954, she also wrote a weekly column about the CYN in "Le Devoir". From 1938 to 1950, she was an officer of the CYN, and in 1956, she was elected president of the CSNH. 

The School of Awakening.
Around 1935, Gauvreau founded a unique educational institution, the School of Awakening (L'École de l'Éveil). Much as with the CYN, the goal was to awaken promising primary-school students to the natural sciences. Students attended for one hour a week, and the emphasis was on developing observational and field-work skills through direct contact with living plants and animals. From 1939 to 1957, classes were held at the <a href="Montreal%20%20Botanical%20Garden">Montreal Botanical Garden</a>. Following a disagreement with city authorities, Gauvreau decided to move the school into the Cardinal-Léger Institute. Subsequently, several more branches were opened around the city and its suburbs. By 1960, more than 3500 students had passed through the school.

Radio and television.
In 1943, Gauvreau had a radio program for young children on which she told stories about the natural world using the pseudonym "La Fée des fleurs" (Fairy of the Flowers). In 1963-1964, she was associated with the television series "Wonders of Nature".

Publications.
Gauvreau published extensively, writing for both scientific journals and the popular press. Her works include two books for children on Canadian flora and fauna, her thesis on marine algae, and over 250 articles mainly for children.

Legacy.
The <a href="Marcelle-Gauvreau%20Ecological%20Reserve">Marcelle-Gauvreau Ecological Reserve</a> in Quebec was named in her honor.

Frances Augusta Hemingway Conant

Frances Augusta Conant (December 23, 1842 - ) was an American journalist, editor, and businesswoman. She was the founder and principal promoter of the <a href="Illinois%20Woman%27s%20Press%20Association">Illinois Woman's Press Association</a> (IWPA).

Early years and education.
Frances Augusta Hemingway was born in <a href="West%20Burlington%2C%20New%20York">West Burlington, New York</a>, December 23, 1842. Her parents were Curtis and Martha R. Hemingway. She was educated in the western part of the <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">State</a> and in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>. In early girlhood, she became a contributor to New York publications. 

Career.
In 1864, in Brooklyn, she married Claudius W. Conant, of New York. After 1892, Conant became a resident of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>. She usually passed the winters in traveling through the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>. She was for several years a special correspondent of the "Living Church" and a contributor to the "Advance" and other religious publications of Chicago, as well as to some journals, and, occasionally, short stories of hers appeared in leading <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> publications. During the <a href="World%20Cotton%20Centennial">World Cotton Centennial</a> of 1884-85, she was the only special woman correspondent in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> for a mechanical and scientific journal, ably representing the "Industrial World," of Chicago. 

She often wrote as a collaborator with her husband, who was connected with the "American Field", and they frequently did editorial work interchangeably. Conant is an earnest advocate of the cause of industrial education, and she was editor and business manager of the "Journal of Industrial Education" in the early days of its publication. Her reputation as a writer of short sketches of travel lead to an engagement as editor of the "American Traveler and Tourist", published in Chicago, which position she held for two years, until she became interested in a commercial enterprise. Though rarely working in any associations, she developed ability as a promoter and organizer. 

Following up on an idea of <a href="Marion%20A.%20McBride">Marion A. McBride</a> of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Post">The Boston Post</a>" during the World Cotton Centennial, Conant and Dr. <a href="Julia%20Holmes%20Smith">Julia Holmes Smith</a> helped found the IWPA, and Conant was the principal promoter of the IWPA, the first independent State organization for the purpose of affording practical assistance to women in literary pursuits. She was secretary of that association for the first two years, and received an honorary life membership in recognition of her services. 

Conant was noted for being generous in giving time and thought to all appeals for help. Like many women in public work, she became the constant recipient of touching appeals from other women, usually those without technical training, for assistance to occupations by which they could earn a living. She became oppressed by the problem: "What shall we do with this unskilled army?" When a plan for employing large numbers of these untrained applicants was presented to Conant she withdrew from editorial work, in 1891, to engage in the promotion and organization of a corporation projected to give, eventually, remunerative employment to thousands of women in all parts of the country. She was secretary of the company during its first year and took an active part in the business management, then she resigned her trust to others, having made a record of phenomenal success. The year closed with the company well established.

Lucius Valerius Propinquus

Lucius Valerius Propinquus was a <a href="Roman%20empire">Roman</a> <a href="Roman%20senate">senator</a> active in the second century AD. He was <a href="Roman%20consul">suffect consul</a> who replaced the ordinary consul <a href="Marcus%20Annius%20Verus">Marcus Annius Verus</a> and was the colleague of the other ordinary consul <a href="Gaius%20Eggius%20Ambibulus">Gaius Eggius Ambibulus</a> for the remainder of the first "<a href="nundinium">nundinium</a>" of 126.

His full name was reconstructed by <a href="G%C3%A9za%20Alf%C3%B6ldy">Géza Alföldy</a> from a fragmentary inscription found in <a href="Tarraco">Tarraco</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, and is thought to be Lucius Valerius Pomponius Granius Grattius [? Cerealis] Geminius Restitutus. <a href="Ronald%20Syme">Ronald Syme</a> identified his place of origin as <a href="Liria">Liria</a> in <a href="Tarraconensis">Tarraconensis</a>.

Career.
Due to the nature of the Spanish inscription, only a few of the offices Propinquus held are known for certain. The earliest that can be identified is "<a href="legatus">legatus</a>" or commander of <a href="Legio%20VI%20Victrix">Legio VI Victrix</a>, around 120; <a href="Anthony%20Birley">Anthony Birley</a> is uncertain whether Propinquus held his commission before or after the legion's transfer to <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a> in 122, or whether he was the predecessor or successor of <a href="Publius%20Tullius%20Varro">Publius Tullius Varro</a>, consul 127, also known to have commanded the legion around that period.

The inscription indicates he was next governor of a province, but all of the name is lost except for the initial letter "A". While <a href="Arabia%20Petraea">Arabia Petraea</a> is a possibility, Birley believes a more likely candidate is <a href="Gallia%20Aquitania">Gallia Aquitania</a> (usually referred to in Roman inscriptions as simply "Aquitania"). <a href="Werner%20Eck">Werner Eck</a> agrees with Birley, and dates his tenure as 123/124-124/125. Propinquus held no further offices until after his consulship, when he was appointed "cura alvei Tiberius"; also following his consulate, Propinquus was co-opted into the "<a href="quindecimviri%20sacris%20faciundis">quindecimviri sacris faciundis</a>", one of the major priesthoods of ancient Rome. This was followed by Propinquus being appointed governor of the imperial province of <a href="Germania%20Inferior">Germania Inferior</a> 130/131-132-133. His career was successfully completed when the <a href="sortition">sortition</a> selected him <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a>ar governor of <a href="Asia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Asia</a>, one of the most desired proconsular offices to hold; Propinquus was governor 140/141.

Edward Wilkinson (cricketer)

Edward Obert Hindley Wilkinson (16 October 1853 – 8 February 1881) was an <a href="England">English</a> soldier and a <a href="cricketer">cricketer</a> who played in five <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> matches for <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a> and the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Gentlemen of the Marylebone Cricket Club</a> between 1873 and 1875. He was born at <a href="Stevenage">Stevenage</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, and died by drowning in the Ingogo river in the retreat from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Schuinshoogte">Battle of Schuinshoogte</a> in the <a href="First%20Boer%20War">First Boer War</a> in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.

Wilkinson was educated at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> and at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, though he appears to have left <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> without taking a degree. As a right-handed lower-order batsman and wicketkeeper, he played in the <a href="Eton%20v%20Harrow">Eton v Harrow</a> match in both 1871 and 1872, captaining the side in the second year. At Cambridge, he was given three matches for the University side, and was wicketkeeper in at least one of them, perhaps all three, but made little impression as a batsman.

Mary Allen West

Mary Allen West (July 13, 1837 - 1892) was an American journalist, editor, educator, superintendent of schools, and temperance worker. A teacher in her early career, she served as superintendent of schools in <a href="Knox%20County%2C%20Illinois">Knox County, Illinois</a>, being one of the first women to fill such a position in <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>. An active supporter of the <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance movement</a>, West served as president of the Illinois <a href="Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union">Woman's Christian Temperance Union</a> (WCTU), and editor of the national paper, "Union Signal". Her other roles within the WCTU included superintendent of the Training School for Temperance Workers, Illinois State Superintendent of Temperance in Schools of Higher Education, as well as Stockholder, Director, and Secretary of the Woman's Publication Association. She was the first president of the <a href="Illinois%20Woman%27s%20Press%20Association">Illinois Woman's Press Association</a>, member of the Chicago Woman's Club, director of the Protective Agency for Women and Children. West was the author of "Childhood: Its Care and Culture" (1892). She died in Japan while training temperance workers in organization and promotion reform efforts.

Early years and education.
Mary Allen West was born in <a href="Galesburg%2C%20Illinois">Galesburg, Illinois</a>, July 13, 1837; she was the first child born in this city. Her parents, Nehemiah West (1800-1847) and Catherine Neely West (1799-1881), were among the founders of <a href="Knox%20College%20%28Illinois%29">Knox College</a>, one of the earliest collegiate institutions in the <a href="Mississippi%20Valley">Mississippi Valley</a>. The parents hailed from New York and founded Galesburg, with <a href="George%20Washington%20Gale">George Washington Gale</a>, <a href="Sylvanus%20Ferris">Sylvanus Ferris</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20Simmons">Thomas Simmons</a>. Her siblings included Byron Stanhope West (1829-1910), Barton R. West (1830-1850), and Carleton Cook West (1833-1920).

West was a healthy, vigorous, studious child, maturing early, both mentally and physically. She was prepared for college before she had reached the age for admission, and graduated at the age of 17. 

Career.
Educator.
Immediately after graduation, she began to teach school, which she then believed to be her life work. She was so successful in teaching and so influential in educational circles that she was twice elected to the office of superintendent of schools in Knox County, Illinois, being one of the first women to fill such a position in Illinois. She served in that capacity for nine years and resigned on accepting the presidency of the Illinois WCTU. She attended many educational conventions and was a power in them, and continually wrote for school and other journals. She thus discovered to herself and others her capacity for almost unlimited hard work. Home duties were at that time pressing heavily, including as they did the care and nursing of an invalid mother and sister. She occupied a prominent social position, and her work included Sunday-school teaching. 

Journalist and editor.
When the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> broke out, she worked earnestly in organizing women into aid societies to assist the <a href="Sanitary%20Commission">Sanitary Commission</a>. Her first editorial work was at long range, as she edited in Illinois the "Home Magazine", which was published nearly away, in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Later, she left writing for active work in the <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance movement</a> throughout the State. When the woman's crusade sounded the call of woman, and after the organization of the WCTU, she became an earnest worker in the cause. She assisted in organizing the women of Illinois, and in a short time, became their State president. In that office, she traveled very extensively throughout Illinois and became familiar with the homes of the people. 

She wrote scores of leaflets and pamphlets, all strong and terse, including "Our Toiling Children" with <a href="Florence%20Kelley">Florence Kelley</a>. Other leaflets included "Organization", "Gospel Meetings, Band of Hope, Temperance Literature:, "Scientific Temperance Literature", and "Temperance in Public Schools".

While she was State president of the WCTU, she was often called upon to "help out" in the editorial labors of <a href="Mary%20Bannister%20Willard">Mary Bannister Willard</a>, the editor of the "Union Signal", published in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Later, it was merged with "Our Union", becoming the "<a href="Union%20Signal">Union Signal</a>", under the editorship of Willard. During this time, she also served as the superintendent of the Training School for Temperance Workers, Illinois State Superintendent of Temperance in Schools of Higher Education, as well as Stockholder, Director, and Secretary of the Woman's Publication Association.

Before Willard went to Germany to reside, West removed to Chicago, and accepted the position of editor-in-chief, with Mrs. <a href="Elizabeth%20Wheeler%20Andrew">Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew</a> as her assistant. As editor of that paper, the organ of the national and the world's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, her responsibilities were immense, but they were carried well. She met the demands of her enormous constituency in a remarkable degree. A paper having a circulation of nearly 100,000 women, needed judicious and strong, as well as thorough and comprehensive, editing. This the "Union Signal" had, and the women of the WCTU repeatedly, in the most emphatic manner, endorsed West's policy and conduct of the paper.

"Childhood: Its Care and Culture".
While serving as Illinois state president of the WCTU, and traveling throughout the state, the knowledge she gained of the inner life of thousands of homes, together with her intimate studies of children in the schoolroom, efficiently supplemented her natural bias for the task of writing her book for mothers, "Childhood, its Care and Culture". It was published by the Woman's Temperance Association of Chicago in 1892. In it, the author claimed that the book “has grown naturally out of the rich soil of a thousand homes,” which was interpreted to mean that the author wrote from experience and observation and not from mere theory. The contents were varied, including chapters on the child's body, babyhood, childhood, boyhood and girlhood, children's rights, work and play, amusements, behavior, domestic economy, family government, practical health hints, and other topics. There were also a number of illustrations, and, interspersed among the reading matter, were songs set to music, suitable for the nursery and the home. The book was an octavo of 722 pages, including a copious index. It was pervaded by strong Christian and temperance sentiment, the author holding that the growth in a child of a true and healthy religious and physical life was greatly to be desired and sought after, not only for its own sake, but for the general well being of society. On the various practical questions coming under treatment, the views set forth were characterized as sound and sensible. The variety and range of topics almost invited the remark that some at least must suffer from superficial or hackneyed treatment, but the author appeared to have labored conscientiously and carefully over each section, and to have brought together many wise thoughts and counsels for the benefit of those who really desire guidance and help in the care and nurture of children.

Illinois Woman's Press Association.
Soon after she went to Chicago to reside, some Chicago women, both writers and publishers, organized the Illinois Woman's Press Association, its avowed object being to provide a means of communication between woman writers, and to secure the benefits resulting from organized effort West was made president, and is now filling the position for the fifth consecutive annual term. Her work in that sphere has been a unifying one. She has brought into harmony many conflicting elements, and has helped to carry the association through the perils which always beset the early years of an organization. She has been a wise and practical leader, inaugurating effective branches of work, which have been of great value to the association. 

Personal life.
She was a member of the Chicago Woman's Club, and an effective director of the Protective Agency for Women and Children, but the strain of that work proved too great, and she has stepped outside its directorship, although remaining an ardent upholder of the agency. Her heart was in her Galesburg home, the home of her childhood and youth, and when she allowed herself a holiday, it was to spend a few days there. West, in 1892, visited <a href="California">California</a>, the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Sandwich Islands</a>, and Japan in the interests of temperance work,

During a Lonesome River Band reunion performance, all three discovered a mutual longing to once again perform together. Band of Ruhks released a self-titled album in 2015. Brian Fesler plays banjo in the band.

Music instruction.
Smith has taught at guitar workshops and master classes. In 2004, AcuTab Publications released Smith's "Tunes and Techniques", a two-DVD instruction set.

Denain-Anzin

Denain-Anzin (Société des hauts-fourneaux, forges et aciéries de Denain et d'Anzin) was a steel manufacturer in <a href="Denain">Denain</a> and <a href="Anzin">Anzin</a> in the <a href="Nord%20%28French%20department%29">Nord department</a> of France.
The company was created through the merger of two smaller forges to produce rails for the Nord railway company.
After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> it was merged with other companies in 1948 to form <a href="Usinor">Usinor</a>.

Origins.
The Société Serret, Lelièvre et Cie was constituted in 1834 to build and run the Forges de Denain.
The partners were Georges Serret, Isidore Charpentier-Odolant and Charles Lelièvre. 
<a href="Pierre%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Dumont">Pierre François Dumont</a> also participated. 
Serret and Dumont were also partners in the Forges de Raismes (Renaux, Dumant et Cie).
The factory in Denain was located beside the <a href="Scheldt">Escaut</a> river, which had been canalized between <a href="Valenciennes">Valenciennes</a> and <a href="Cambrai">Cambrai</a> since 1775.
The docks on the river were owned by the Compagnie des Mines d'Anzin, a coal mining operation, apart from one quay used by the steel factory.
The Mines d'Anzin operated three coal mines below the factory.
The first coke-fired blast furnaces of the Forges de Denain began operations in 1836.
In 1834 Benoît Vasseur, using external capital, asked for permission to build an iron factory at Anzin similar to that at Denain.
Due to lack of money, Vasseur was unable to build a blast furnace and built only a forge and puddling furnaces.
In 1842 he sold the business, the Forges et Laminoirs d'Anzin, to the Société de Commerce de Bruxelles, a subsidiary of the Société Générale de Belgique.
This was a major bank associated with the Rothschilds that worked with <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Talabot">Léon Talabot</a> in the Nord.
Both the Denain and Anzin companies had little difficulty training their workers, since there was a long history of mining and industry in the region.

Construction of the <a href="Chemins%20de%20Fer%20du%20Nord">Chemins de Fer du Nord</a> drove the integration of small forges into <a href="rolling%20mill">rolling mill</a>s to supply rails.
The Compagnie du chemin de fer du Nord was unable to import Belgian rails in 1846.
To obtain a better supply, in 1849 the Talabots took control of the Denain and Anzin forges and merged them.
Talabot combined the Forges et Laminoirs d'Anzin with the Serret, Lelièvre, Dumont et Cie company of Denain to form the Société des hauts-fourneaux et des forges de Denain et Anzin, the largest metallurgical company in the <a href="Nord%20%28French%20department%29">Nord Department</a>.

Pre-World War I.
Talabot managed Denain-Anzin after the merger.
Georges Serret, who died in 1854, retained an important stake in the company. 
His second daughter married Hippolyte Waternau, an advocate, who became an administrator of the company.
In 1849 Denain-Anzin had capital of 10 million francs.
At the time of the merger there was no blast furnace at Anzin, while the Denain factory had three.
By 1854 Denain-Anzin had five blast furnaces, of which two were in Anzin.

A difficult period for the manufacturers of the north of France began in 1860, which they blamed entirely on the free-trade <a href="Cobden%E2%80%93Chevalier%20Treaty">Cobden–Chevalier Treaty</a> signed at the start of the year.
In fact the problem was largely caused by depletion of local iron ore, which was causing the cost of production to rise fast.
The imports from Britain and Belgium were not enough to be a significant threat to the iron industry, and imports of cheap coal and coke would have helped.
In 1860 the Inspector-General of Mines, <a href="Charles%20Combes">Charles Combes</a>, wrote to the Minister of Commerce that the real goal of the <a href="Comite%20des%20Forges">Comite des Forges</a>, of which Leon Talabot of Denain-Anzin was president, was to maintain the price of iron by using any arguments of threats they thought would work.

In 1863 Hippolyte Waternau became director.
Waternau was president of the <a href="Society%20of%20Saint%20Vincent%20de%20Paul">Conférence Saint-Vincent-de-Paul</a>.
He introduced sisters of that charity to run several services for Denain-Anzin.
Unlike the nearby coal mines, the demand for steel fluctuated widely, and until 1872 the company's finances were shaky.
In the crisis of 1866–68 the company came close to bankruptcy, and was forced to lay off workers at both plants.
In 1870 the company became a "<a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Anonyme">Société Anonyme</a>".
During the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870 the company was unable to pay its workers in cash, but instead paid in vouchers on the company's food store.

<a href="Paulin%20Talabot">Paulin Talabot</a> became president in 1872.
In 1878 the company was part of a syndicate that obtain the Godbrange concession, and in 1890 obtained part of the neighboring Tiercelet concession.
In 1879 Senelle-Maubeuge and Denain-Anzin bought the Côte-Rouge mining properties.
In 1886 Senelle-Maubeuge and Denain-Anzin acquired the Jarny concession.
In 1896 <a href="Robert%20de%20Nervo">Robert de Nervo</a> became chairman of the Denain-Anzin iron works, which he began to modernise.
The Nervo family would make Denain-Anzin the fifth-largest steel producer in France by 1913.
In 1902 Denain-Anzin started up a new steelworks using the <a href="Thomas%20process">Thomas process</a>, the Aciérie Jordan, the largest in the Nord.
This was one of the largest and most efficient Thomas steel mills in the country.
The company absorbed the Compagnie des Charbonnages d'Azincourt on 12 July 1906 to ensure a supply of affordable coal.
Denain-Anzin delayed electrification until about 1913, since the change required conversion of all its steam-based power plants.
In the fifteen years before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–18) the company invested 75 million francs.
In 1913 Denain-Anzin produced 390,000 tons of steel, or 7.68% of total French steel production.
The company produced only 17,000 tons of iron due to low demand and low profitability.
In 1913 the company was the 17th largest publicly held manufacturing enterprise in France, and 8th largest primary metals company with assets of 64.1 million francs.
The largest steel company, <a href="Marine%20et%20Homecourt">Marine et Homecourt</a>, had assets of 120.7 million francs.

World War I.
In 1917 the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Mokta%20El%20Hadid">Société Mokta El Hadid</a> and the Société des Hauts Fourneaux de Rouen agreed to form a joint venture to exploit the Boukhadra deposits in Algeria, which was supported by the minister <a href="Albert%20Thomas%20%28minister%29">Albert Thomas</a>.
However, the administration of Algerian governor <a href="Charles%20Lutaud">Charles Lutaud</a> submitted an alternative proposal to the government that required the company to build blast furnaces in Bône and to pay higher royalties to Algeria.
The agreement and specifications for this project were signed early in 1918, with 85% of the capital supplied by Mokta and Hauts Fourneaux de Rouen, and 15% by Denain-Anzin and a consortium of Algerian banks.
Two blast furnaces would be built with combined annual capacity of 80,000 tons.
However, after <a href="Charles%20Jonnart">Charles Jonnart</a> returned to Algeria as governor the project was delayed and eventually cancelled.

Later history.
The war damages act of 1919 took little account of the age of the facilities that had been destroyed.
For Nord-Est, which had 80% new plant in 1914, it was a disaster.
For Denain-Anzin, it was a boon, since obsolete plant could be replaced.
The Denain factory was built in 1920 to produce rather more than 500,000 tons of steel per year, and would achieve a record of 2,419,631 tons in 1974.
The company became a public limited liability company on 19 November 1920.
Denain-Anzin built a railway line to Azincourt to carry coke from the mines there to the factory.
Between 1928 and 1946 Denain-Anzin invested 75 million in its two factories.
In the 1930s the company belonged to a cartel, the Comptoir Sidérurgique de France, which set quotas for each company's production of semi finished steel, structural shapes, merchant bars, thick plates and sheets. However, discipline was weak and the members often exceeded their quotas.
Well before the 1948 merger with Nord-Est, the products manufactured by Denain-Anzin had slowly diverged from those by the Valenciennes division of Nord-Est, allowing each firm to scale up production in their speciality with reduced competition.
For example, the two companies produced the same quantities of girders in 1930, but by 1936 Nord-Est produced six times as much as Denain-Anzin.
After the June 1940 defeat of France during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> (1939–45), a law of 16 August 1940 created Sidenor, the Groupement des Industries Side-rugiques du Nord-Pas-de-Calais. 
Denain-Anzin and Nord-Est both came under the control of Sidenor, producing 80% of its steel.

<a href="Usinor">Usinor</a> (Union Sidérurgique du Nord) was created on 1 July 1948 by a merger of Denain-Anzin with Nord-Est (Forges et Aciéries du Nord et de l'Est).
In 1957 the company became "Denain-Anzin", and it absorbed the Société anonyme des tubes de Valenciennes et de Denain, the Compagnie des terres réfractaires françaises, the Société des argiles de la Brie, the Société Les réfractaires de Longueville and the Société des produits minéraux industriels.
In 1965 it merged with the Société des forges et aciéries du Nord et de l'Est to form Denain-Anzin Nord-Est.

In his doctoral dissertation, he studied Communist support in the municipality of <a href="Kuopio">Kuopio</a>. When analysing the basis of Communism's support, Nousiainen distinguished Communism between Communist rural and Communist urban areas.

From 1953 to 1960, Nousiainen worked at the Finnish Information Office. Between 1961 and 1963 he served as associate professor of social sciences at the University of Education of Jyväskylä.

His last years at the University of Turku Nousiainen served as a Chancellor of the University in 1994-97.

After moving to Turku, Nousiainen focused on research into Finnish state institutions in research. Over the next thirty years, he has published several books and articles in the area. Nousiainen has been a key player in the development of the so-called Turku School of Political Studies. The school has profoundly profiled research into political institutions and comparative research of political systems.

Between 1967 and 1968 and 1972-73, Nousiainen served as dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Turku as deputy rector of the University in 1975-78, Chairman of the University Council in 1985-88 and Chancellor of the University in 1994-97.

The 352nd Rifle Division started forming in August, 1941, as a standard <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> rifle division, at <a href="Bugulma">Bugulma</a> in <a href="Tatarstan">Tatarstan</a>. When it entered the fighting it was assigned to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Western Front</a> before Moscow, and it would remain in that Front for most of the war; when Western Front was dissolved the division went to one of its successor Fronts and served there until the last few weeks. It took part in the first Soviet winter counteroffensive, then played peripheral roles in the battles around the Rhzev salient, before advancing in the offensive that liberated Smolensk in the summer of 1943. After a series of frustrating attempts during the autumn and winter of 1943-44, the city of <a href="Orsha">Orsha</a> was finally liberated in the opening days of Operation Bagration, and the 352nd was recognized for its role in the battle. Soon after it was further decorated for its part in the liberation of <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a>. In the winter of 1945 the 352nd took part in the invasion of East Prussia and the capture of Königsberg, but in April it finally was swung off its very straightforward combat path when it and its 31st Army were transferred to 1st Ukrainian Front advancing into Czechoslovakia. Soon after the German surrender the division was slated as one of those to be disbanded in place in central Europe.

Formation.
The division began forming on August 1, 1941, in the <a href="Volga%20Military%20District">Volga Military District</a> at Bugulma. Its first commander, Col. Yu.M. Prokofev, was assigned the same day. Its basic order of battle was as follows:
At the time it was forming the division's personnel was noted as containing a "high percentage of <a href="Tatars">Tatars</a>", which is unsurprising, given the location. The 352nd remained in Volga District until November 29, when it was ordered by "STAVKA" to join the <a href="20th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">20th Army</a> in the Moscow region. It joined the Moscow counteroffensive in that Army the following month.

In Western Front.
In the last days of February, 1942, the division was transferred to <a href="5th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">5th Army</a>, still in Western Front, where it would remain until August, 1943. Colonel Prokovev relinquished command of the division on June 5, and was replaced by Lt. Col. A.P. Maltzev, who was promoted to the rank of Colonel on June 27.

In the planning for <a href="Operation%20Mars">Operation Mars</a>, 5th Army was intended to participate in a widening offensive, after German <a href="9th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">9th Army</a> was encircled and defeated, through <a href="Vyasma">Vyasma</a> to link up with forces of <a href="Kalinin%20Front">Kalinin Front</a> near <a href="Smolensk">Smolensk</a> to destroy <a href="Army%20Group%20Center">Army Group Center</a>. In the event, 9th Army was able to hold out, and this operation did not come to pass. On February 6, 1943, Maj. Gen. M.A. Pronin took command of the division, which he would hold until June 2. In the aftermath of Operation Mars, on February 22, the 352nd, with the <a href="29th%20Guards%20Rifle%20Division">29th Guards Rifle Division</a>, assaulted the positions of German <a href="4th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">4th Army's</a> <a href="35th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">35th Infantry Division</a> east of <a href="Gzhatsk">Gzhatsk</a>, tearing a small breach in the division's defenses. 5th Army then committed the 153rd Tank Brigade, plus a ski battalion, and later a full ski brigade, into the gap. After days of heavy fighting the exploiting forces were encircled and mostly destroyed by German counterattacks. The Front shut down until the German forces began evacuating the Rzhev salient in March.

Shortly after the start of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Smolensk%20%281943%29">summer offensive towards Smolensk</a> in August, the division was transferred to <a href="49th%20Army">49th Army</a>, where it would remain until the spring of the following year. It was also assigned to <a href="62nd%20Rifle%20Corps">62nd Rifle Corps</a> at this time, but by the beginning of October it was back to being an independent division within its Army. As Western Front tried to continue its offensive into eastern Belorussia in early October, forward elements of 49th Army reached the <a href="Pronya%20River%20%28Russia%29">Pronya River</a> late on October 2. The 352nd was south of the town of <a href="Drybin%20Raion">Drybin</a>. The strong German defenses in this region, manned by their <a href="342nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">342nd</a> and 35th Infantry Divisions, along with the weakness of his Army after months of offensive combat, convinced <a href="Ivan%20Grishin">Col. Gen. I.T. Grishin</a> that any further offensive action would be futile.

Operation Bagration.
On June 27, the division was given credit for its role in the liberation of the city of Orsha and received its name as an honorific: On July 28 the division was further distinguished with a unit award of the Order of the Red Banner for its service in the liberation of Grodno.

Postwar.
The division held the full title of "352nd Rifle, Orsha, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Red%20Banner">Order of the Red Banner</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20Suvorov">Order of Suvorov</a> Division" [Russian: 352-я стрелковая Оршанская Краснознамённая ордена Суворова дивизия] when the fighting came to an end. According to "STAVKA" Order No. 11096 of May 29, 1945, part 8, the 352nd is listed as one of the rifle divisions to be "disbanded in place".

Reginald K (Kevin) Gee

Reginald K (Kevin) Gee (April 28, 1964) is a contemporary artist who for over 25 years has created hundreds of paintings, including the brown paper bag series (1995-2002). Gee broke into the art world at an outdoor exhibition in 1986 at Milwaukee’s Performing Arts Center, now known as the <a href="Marcus%20Center">Marcus Center</a>. In 2013, the David Barnett Gallery held a 25-year retrospective of Gee's paintings.

Early life.
Reginald K Gee was born in <a href="Milwaukee">Wisconsin</a> in 1964 and is of African and <a href="Native-American">Native-American</a> descent. Gee is the youngest of three siblings.

Art Career.
Gee’s professional art debut occurred February 1988 during an exhibition at the Dean Jensen Gallery in <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. The <a href="Milwaukee%20Journal%20Sentinel">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a> has referred to Gee as a "budding genius ... an artistic wunderkind," who produces "stunning, complex visions" and describes his art as “tribal art-derived from Pop Culture and art magazines”. "The work looks like, and is perhaps more authentic than, the garden variety of funky imagery...Gee's pictures are full of undigested cultural and psychological fragments that float together in surprisingly engaging ways." 

Gee's subject matter includes jazz musicians, surreal landscapes, seascapes, romance, fantasy and social commentary. During the early 1990s, Gee’s art was shown at the Baltimore Folk & Visionary Art Show, the New York Outsider Art Fair and the National Black Fine Art Show at the <a href="Puck%20Building">Puck Building</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

In an August 11, 1999 interview with the Milwaukee Journal’s art critic, James Auer, “The Visual Arts, “Artist listens to his life’s calling,” Gee speaks about his occasional anxiety attacks since childhood and the spiritual prophecy that had him move to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, start a ministry among the homeless and pursue the art career he started in <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>. Upscale Magazine featured Gee in its April 2010 issue, “A Man Apart. Reginald Gee Draws Inspiration From The Human Experience.”

Helen Ekin Starrett

Helen Ekin Starrett (September 19, 1840 - December 16, 1920) was an American educator, author, and suffragette. Long engaged in educational work in Chicago, she founded the Kenwood Institute (1884), and Mrs. Starrett's Classical School for Girls (1893), of which she was principal. She served as president of the <a href="Illinois%20Woman%27s%20Press%20Association">Illinois Woman's Press Association</a>, 1893-1894, and was the author of several works. She founded "Western Magazine" (1880-83) in Chicago.

Early years and education.
Helen Martha Ekin was born in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, September 19, 1840. She was the daughter of Rev. John and Esther Fell (Lee) Ekin. She was educated at Pittsburg High School.

Career.
Educator.
Starrett was the founder of Kenwood Institute, <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, before serving as Principal of Mrs. Starrett's Classical School for Girls, a co-operative with the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. This school occupied a colonial home, surrounded by of lawn. Ten resident pupils were received in the family of the Principal. Day pupils were limited in number to 100. Its certificate admits to <a href="Vassar%20College">Vassar College</a>, <a href="Wellesley%20College">Wellesley College</a>, <a href="Smith%20College">Smith College</a>, as well as to the University of Chicago.

Activist, suffragette.
In 1915, she was appointed one of the 100 electors who each five years decided on additions to the list of eminent Americans who would be included in the Hall of Fame established in 1900 by <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>. Starrett and <a href="Ida%20M.%20Tarbell">Ida M. Tarbell</a> were the only women who were added to the list of electors at that time. A delegate to the first U.S. woman suffrage convention (1870) and the last (1920), Starrett was the only surviving member of the pioneer suffragettes who first focused public opinion by means of a general convention on the campaign for women's votes.

Writer.
Starrett was a contributor to magazines, such as "The Continent", as well as educational and religious journals. She was the author of "Future of Educated Women", 1880: "Letters to a Daughter", 1882; "Letters to Elder Daughters", 1883; "Gyppie, an Obituary", 1884; "Pete, the Story of a Chicken", 1885; "Letters to a Little Girl", 1886; "Crocus and Wintergreen, poems" (with her sister, <a href="Frances%20Ekin%20Allison">Frances Ekin Allison</a>).

Published by Jansen, <a href="A.%20C.%20McClurg">McClurg</a> & Co., Chicago, "The Future Of Educated Women", by Helen Ekin Starrett; and "Men, Women And Money", by Frances Ekin Allison, were bound together in one book. The former and larger essay was the more mature of the two, and, although not altogether free from haste and opinionatedness, it had the merit of a point of view. The author discusses the matter of self-support and independence, and that however urgent such may be, they are reduced to insignificance by the necessity of women finding a means of expression for the spiritual growth that takes place in them. She also talk about labor, like virtue, may be its own reward; and from professional and other means of expressing the fullness of human nature, certainly no one should be debarred. The second essay, by Frances Ekin Allison, is thought out on a lower key, and referenced the independence that a woman feels when she has a source of income in her own right.

Personal life.
In February 15, 1864, she married Rev. William A. Starrett. Their children included, Theodore Starrett, Paul Starrett, Ralph Starrett, Katharine Starrett Whitton, Helen Starrett Dinwiddie, Goldwin Starrett, and <a href="William%20A.%20Starrett">William Aiken Starrett</a>. She died December 16, 1920, in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, and was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in <a href="Oakland">Oakland</a>, <a href="California">California</a>.

Elo hell

Elo hell (also known as MMR hell) is a <a href="Video%20game">video gaming</a> term used in <a href="Multiplayer%20online%20battle%20arena">MOBAs</a> and other <a href="Multiplayer%20online%20game">multiplayer online games</a> with competitive modes.

History.
The term was coined based on the <a href="Elo%20rating%20system">Elo rating system</a> designed by <a href="Arpad%20Elo">Arpad Elo</a>, which was initially used for <a href="chess">chess</a> games but began to be used in video games as well. It was initially used by the "<a href="League%20of%20Legends">League of Legends</a>" community, but spread in usage to other games that used the same ranking system. In these games, which also include "<a href="Overwatch%20%28video%20game%29">Overwatch</a>", players are ranked based on their individual and team performance. However, the shortcomings in this system are that comparatively unskilled players, with inflated ratings, can be matched via automated <a href="Matchmaking%20%28video%20games%29">matchmaking</a> to legitimately high skilled players and drag them down when they contribute to the loss of a match. At low Elo, a skilled player will likely find it easy to rise in rank, while at high Elo, the quality of players improves. However, there is a certain range where skilled players can remain stuck regardless of their personal skill, which is referred to as Elo hell. In "League of Legends", it is said to occur between the 1300 and 1500 range.

Elo rankings have also been "abused" by players who create parties of their friends in order to "escape" Elo hell. This has been addressed by forcing players who are in groups to play against groups of similar size. Another way players have attempted to bypass Elo hell is by <a href="Smurfing%20%28video%20games%29">smurfing</a>, or creating new accounts without a skill rating, which allows them to ascend in rank faster than they would with their original account.

Effects.
Being in Elo hell has been known to cause frustration and <a href="video%20game%20rage">video game rage</a>. This can lead to toxic behavior amongst players who are angry at their teammates for sabotaging their Elo rating, whether the grievance is legitimate or not. This has caused games that use the Elo system to be noted as some of the most toxic games to play.

Reception.
<a href="ESports">ESports</a> players of competitive games have recommended that players who are "stuck in Elo hell" "take every game seriously" and focus on winning at all costs. They have also suggested that players should always blame themselves for any losses rather than blaming it on their team. eSports critic and Youtuber Duncan "Thorin" Shields claimed that Elo hell was actually caused by the player themselves, due to their <a href="positive%20illusions">positive illusions</a> about their own skill.

The third competitive season of "Overwatch" introduced changes in skill rating ostensibly designed to prevent players from being stuck in Elo hell. However, in season five of "Overwatch", in-game toxic behavior and community backlash only increased due to tweaks in the game's Elo algorithms, causing the game's competitive mode to become "depressing".

The area received protection in 1988 "to preserve an important wetland area with its appertaining plant communities, bird life, and other wildlife," according to the conservation regulations. The area is a shallow bay with a seashore rich in species and large tidal banks and sandy areas. The north and east sides have a <a href="beach%20meadow">beach meadow</a> with small ponds and transition into a flat marshland. It is considered one of the most conservation-worthy seasides in the county. The bay serves as a resting and overwintering site for birds, and there are many nesting species of regional importance; altogether, 17 species have one of their most important regional concentrations here, and one species has one of its most important national concentrations here. The area is well suited for study and teaching, and for directly observing bird migrations.

Plot.
Agustina has been away at school when she returns home to Madrid to see the mother she hasn't seen in over eight years. Delighted at the visit, Agustina's mother, Elena, is dismayed at her daughter's conservative appearance. Elena re-does Agustina's dress, which Agustina's boyfriend, Manolo, disapproves of when he arrives the next day. When Agustina's father Enrique arrives to woo Elena to return to him, he sees that the only way that Manolo's parents will approve of his marriage to Agustina is if he can remove Agustina from Elena's influence. He invites Elena to return with him to his ranch, but Elena wishes to remain in Madrid and pursue her opera career. The two live apart so that Enrique can see to his ranch while she pursues her career. 

Agustina guilts her mother into going to the ranch, and the two, along with a coterie of Elena's friends, as well as Manolo, travel to visit Enrique. The large group quickly makes themselves at home. As the group cavorts scantily clad outfits, Manolo is angered by Agustina's lack of decorum. Agustina leaves in a huff, followed by a friend of her mother's, Juan Manuel, an attaché of the Brazilian Embassy in Madrid. Caught in a storm, the couple seeks shelter in the caretaker's cottage on Enrique's farm. 

Meanwhile, Enrique orders Elena's friends to leave his ranch, which they do, however Elena begins to pack to follow them. When Juan and Agustina return to the main house, Juan seeks out Elena to tell her that he has fallen in love with her daughter. Delighted at the news, she embraces him, which is seen by Enrique, who gets the wrong impression and orders Juan from his home. However Juan returns the next morning and proposes to Agustina, she accepts and the two leave on their way to Juan's next post in Tokyo.

Enrique, realizing his mistaken jealousy, chases after Elena, who is about to board a steamship. Knowing they love one another, but not knowing whether they should return to the ranch or to Madrid, they flip a coin. When it lands in the water, they decide to split their time between the two.

Ethics in mathematics

Ethics in mathematics is a field of <a href="applied%20ethics">applied ethics</a>, the inquiry into ethical aspects of the applications of mathematics. It deals with the professional responsibilities of <a href="mathematicians">mathematicians</a> whose work influences decisions with major consequences, such as in law, finance, the military, and environmental science.

Need for ethics in the mathematics profession.
Mathematicians in industrial, scientific, military and intelligence roles crucially influence decisions with large consequences. For example, complex calculations were needed for the success of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, while the overextended use of the <a href="Copula%20%28probability%20theory%29">Gaussian copula</a> formula to price derivatives before the <a href="Global%20Financial%20Crisis">Global Financial Crisis</a> of 2008 has been called "the formula that killed Wall Street", and the theory of global warming depends on the reliability of <a href="climate%20models">mathematical models of climate</a>. For the same reason as in <a href="medical%20ethics">medical ethics</a> and <a href="engineering%20ethics">engineering ethics</a>, the high impact of the consequences of decisions imposes serious ethical obligations on practitioners to consider the rights and wrongs of their advice and decisions.

Disasters and scandals involving the use of mathematics.
These illustrate the major consequences of numerical mistakes and hence the need for ethical care.

Ethical issues in the mathematical profession.
Mathematicians in professional roles in finance and similar work have a particular responsibility to ensure they use the best methods and data to reach the right answer, as the prestige of mathematics is high and others rely on mathematical results which they cannot fully understand. Other ethical issues are shared with <a href="information%20economy">information economy</a> professionals in general, such as <a href="duty%20of%20care">duty of care</a>, <a href="confidentiality">confidentiality</a> of information, <a href="whistleblowing">whistleblowing</a>, and avoiding <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a>.

Misuse of statistics.
Much of mathematics as used in applications involves the drawing of conclusions from quantitative data. It is recognised that there are many difficulties in reaching and communicating such conclusions accurately, honestly and with due regard to the uncertainties that remain. It is easy for a statistician to mislead clients whose understanding of data and inference is less developed, so statisticians have professional responsibilities to act fairly.

Ethics in pure mathematical research.
The <a href="American%20Mathematical%20Society">American Mathematical Society</a> publishes a code of ethical guidelines for mathematical researchers. The responsibilities of researchers include being knowledgeable in the field, avoiding plagiarism and giving credit, to publish without unreasonable delay, and to correct errors. The <a href="European%20Mathematical%20Society">European Mathematical Society</a> Ethics Committee also publishes a code of practice relating to the publication, editing and refereeing of research.

It has been argued that as pure mathematical research is relatively harmless, it raises few urgent ethical issues. However, that raises the question of whether and why pure mathematics is ethically worth doing, given that it consumes the lives of many highly intelligent people who could be making more immediately useful contributions.

Teaching ethics in mathematics.
Courses in the ethics of mathematics remain rare. The <a href="University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">University of New South Wales</a> taught a compulsory course on Professional Issues and Ethics in Mathematics in its mathematics degrees from 1998 to 2012.

Awards, honours and recognition.
Oscar Academy Membership - 2017.
Amidst some protest from across the film making world, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which bestows its coveted honour, <a href="Oscar">Oscar</a>, on the best of talents in the world cinema, has of late been forced to look beyond Hollywood and the western world to usher in diversity in its selection of films and film making talents. In keeping with its new-found diversity policy, the Academy this year has selected as many as 14 persons from the Indian film industry to be on its selection jury, some as members from different crafts and some as members-at-large. While most of them are actors and directors of repute, of whom much have been written about already, there is one among them who has scarcely been mentioned by the Indian media in general. His name is Ujwal N. Nirgudkar, whose contributions to the film processing in this side of the globe and the innovations he has brought about in the field are not as well known in India as it should have been. He is one of those men who work tirelessly (and in his case, Innovatively), to make glamour come aglow on the screen.

OneShot (video game)

OneShot is a puzzle/adventure <a href="indie%20game">indie game</a> released on December 8, 2016 by publisher <a href="Degica">Degica</a>. The game contains <a href="metafiction">metafictional</a> concepts, which have been described by the developers as 'the world knows you exist'. This affects the story in game, which depicts the <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>, Niko, and the <a href="Gamer">player</a> as separate characters.

Overview.
The game begins with a juvenile cat-person, Niko, awaking in an unfamiliar and dark world. He interacts with an computer, which addresses the player by their actual name (derived from the computer's <a href="login%20name">login name</a>) via a <a href="dialog%20box">dialog box</a> outside the game window. This leads to Niko discovering the sun, which takes the form of a <a href="lightbulb">lightbulb</a>. Niko is soon made aware of the player's presence, and discovers that the player is a <a href="god">god</a>, while he is the 'Messiah'. The player's resposibility as god is to help guide Niko – to this end, Niko contacts the player through dialog options. Niko can also rest, which causes the program to close; upon reopening, a short <a href="dream%20sequence">dream sequence</a> is played. Both the player and Niko's eventual goal is to carry the sun through the world's three areas and reach a central tower. Once there, they aim to place the ightbulb on the top of the tower, therefore restoring light to the world.

Gameplay is primarily composed of solving puzzles, involving combining items, and including fetch <a href="quest%20%28video%20gaming%29">quests</a>. Throughout the game, the player encounters in-game computers, which signal that the player has to find content outside the game (for example, in the <a href="filesystem">filesystem</a>).

Development.
The game started as <a href="freeware">freeware</a>; this version was made in a month, and released online on June 30, 2014. Its creators, Eliza Velasquez and Casey Gu, cited several inspirations for their work, including "<a href="Hyper%20Light%20Drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>", "<a href="Yume%20Nikki">Yume Nikki</a>", and "<a href="The%20Little%20Prince">The Little Prince</a>". After being featured at <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">GDC</a>, the previous version's 'rerelease' was made available on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> two years later, on December 8, 2016. On March 28, 2017, the Steam version was updated, with a new 'Solstice' ending path that solved some mysteries that players had about the game's content. 

Reception.
"OneShot" received largely positive reviews, and was awarded 84/100 by <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. Reviewers largely praised the game's story and <a href="metafiction">metafictional</a> content, choosing not to focus on its gameplay aspects. <a href="New%20Game%20Network">New Game Network</a> gave the game 82/100, comparing it to "<a href="Undertale">Undertale</a>" and "<a href="Pony%20Island">Pony Island</a>", but pointed out that it would not be seen as 'revolutionary'. Additionally, they called the game's cast of characters 'lacking', stating they were too distant from Niko. A more positive review was given by <a href="Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Shotgun">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>, who referred to it as 'Completely charming, delightfully written, and extremely clever'. "<a href="Hardcore%20Gamer">Hardcore Gamer</a>" similarily praised it, giving the game 4.5/5, and calling it 'an unforgettable adventure'.

<doc id="54956391" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54956391" title="A Breath of Life">
A Breath of Life

A Breath of Life is the last novel by Brazilian author <a href="Clarice%20Lispector">Clarice Lispector</a>. It was published posthumously in Brazil in the late 1970s. The book takes the form of dialogue between a male "Author" and his female creation, Angela Pralini (a character who shares a name with a character who appears in Lispector's Where Were You at Night). The god-like author infuses the so-called breath of life into his creation who speaks, breathes, lives and dies at his behest. The author loves yet wants to destroy Angela even though he can not ultimately separate her from himself.

The novel has been characterized as a lyrically schizoid duet between two distinct but overlapping voices which delve into the inner nature of thoughts, sensations, words, facts, and objects and the relations between each.The text is also said to confuse the two voices, and open up a wild space of contradiction and paradox.

When Lispector died she left behind a mountain of fragments that compose what became "A Breath of Life". The fragments were structured and organized by Olga Borelli, Lispector's assistant and friend. The final form of the book reflects the dark interior dialogue that took place in Lispector's head near the end of her life.

George H. Merryman

George Harris Merryman was a country doctor, businessman, and politician from the state of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. He was a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> who served two non-consecutive terms in the <a href="Oregon%20House%20of%20Representatives">Oregon House of Representatives</a>. In between those terms, he was elected to the <a href="Oregon%20State%20Senate">Oregon State Senate</a> for one term. In both the house and senate, the districts he represented were large and <a href="rural">rural</a>. Merryman was also a pioneer doctor who made house calls by <a href="horse%20and%20buggy">horse and buggy</a> for many years. He later built the first modern hospital in <a href="Klamath%20Falls%2C%20Oregon">Klamath Falls, Oregon</a>.

Early life.
Merryman was born in <a href="Astoria%2C%20Oregon">Astoria, Oregon</a> on 28 June 1878, the son of Captain John D. and Rebecca Ann (Eagleton) Merryman. His father was the collector of customs in Astoria for several years; then became the cashier for the <a href="United%20States%20Customhouse%20%28Portland%2C%20Oregon%29">United States Customs House</a> in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. When his father took that job, his family moved to <a href="Hillsboro%2C%20Oregon">Hillsboro, Oregon</a>. He attended public school there before enrolling in the <a href="Tualatin%20Academy">Tualatin Academy</a> in <a href="Forest%20Grove%2C%20Oregon">Forest Grove, Oregon</a>. He entered <a href="Oregon%20State%20University">Oregon Agricultural College</a> in 1995. He later went on to attend the <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a> and then the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20College%20of%20Medicine">University of Illinois’ College of Physicians and Surgeons</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, where he received his medical degree in 1902.

After completing medical school, Merryman returned to the Portland, where he was hired by the Portland Asiatic Steamship Company. He was given the position of ship’s doctor on the steamship "Indrasamha". In that capacity, he made several trips to the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, visiting ports in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="China">China</a> including <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Each roundtrip took approximately three months.

In 1903, Merry moved to Klamath Falls in southern Oregon. He was one of the area’s first doctors. In 1904, Merryman became the coroner for <a href="Klamath%20County%2C%20Oregon">Klamath County</a>. He served in the position through 1906. The <a href="Klamath%20Basin">Klamath Basin</a> was a relatively undeveloped area so Merryman made most of his house calls by horse and buggy. Even after he got is first automobile in 1911, he continued to make some house call on horseback to avoid getting his vehicle stuck on rugged country roads. 

During this period, Merryman also became actively involved in professional and community affairs. He was a member of the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> and the Oregon Medical Society as well as the medical societies in Klamath and Lake counties. He was a member of the local <a href="Freemasonry">Masons</a> lodge, the Klamath <a href="Benevolent%20and%20Protective%20Order%20of%20Elks">Elks</a> lodge, and the local <a href="Rotary%20International">Rotary</a> club. He was also a member of the <a href="Military%20Order%20of%20the%20Loyal%20Legion%20of%20the%20United%20States">Military Order of the Loyal Legion</a>. In 1910, Merryman married Mabel Edith Campbell, a local school teacher. Together they had two sons.

Political career.
Merryman, a Republican, entered state level politics in 1904, when he was elected a delegate representing Klamath County at Oregon’s state Republican convention. Two years later, he decided to run for a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives. In the Republican primary, Merryman and <a href="Horace%20P.%20Belknap">Horace P. Belknap</a> (another physician) were nominated for the two District 21 seats. Since no <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> filed for nomination, both Merryman and Belknap were unopposed in the general election. Merryman took his seat in the Oregon legislature when the 24th regular session was called to order on 14 January 1907. As a District 21 delegate, he represented a very large and rural district that included <a href="Crook%20County%2C%20Oregon">Crook</a>, <a href="Grant%20County%2C%20Oregon">Grant</a>, Klamath, and <a href="Lake%20County%2C%20Oregon">Lake</a> counties. At that time, Crook County also included what are today <a href="Deschutes%20County%2C%20Oregon">Deschutes</a> and <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Oregon">Jefferson</a> counties. Together these counties covered over one quarter of the land area of Oregon. During the session, he served on the medicine and pharmacy committee as well as the salaries and mileage committee. The session ended on 23 February.

In 1908, Merryman decided to give up his House seat and run for the state senate in District 17, representing Crook, Klamath, and Lake counties. In the Republican primary, Merryman beats Judge L. T. Willits by 40 votes, loses to in Crook and Lake counties by small margins, but win by enough in Klamath County to carry the election. After winning the Republican primary, Merryman faced the Democratic nominee, G. Springer, in the general election. The general election was another close race, with Merryman winning by a margin of 301 votes. He lost in Crook County by 295 votes, but won in Klamath County by 446 votes and in Lake County by 150 votes.

His election to a four-year senate term allowed him to attend the regular legislative sessions in both 1909 and 1911. During the 1909 session, which began on 11 January, Merryman served on the ways and means, enrolled bills, irrigation, public lands, and medicine, pharmacy and dentistry committees. The 1909 session lasted six weeks, ending on 20 February.

Since he was serving a four-year term, he did not have to run for re-election in 1910. The 1911 legislative session began on 9 January and lasted through 18 February. During that session, Merryman was appointed to the federal regulations, claims, irrigation, and medicine, pharmacy and dentistry committees. In 1912, Merryman decide not to run for a second term in the state senate, and he returned to his medical practice in Klamath Falls. However, he remained active in Republican politics, serving as a state committeeman and attending the state Republican conventions.

After being out of state government for six years, Merryman decided to run once again for a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives. In the 1918 campaign, he promoted conservation and economic growth. He also supported development of war industries, especially food and lumber production. In addition, he highlighted his previous experience in the legislature. Merryman and <a href="Denton%20G.%20Burdick">Denton G. Burdick</a> won the Republican nominations for the two House seats in District 21. No Democratic filed for the District 21 seats, but an independent candidate, P. H. Dencer, ran in the general election again the two Republicans. In the general election, voters selected Merryman and Burdick for the two District 21 seats. The 1919 legislative session began on 13 January and lasted through 27 February. During the session, Merryman served as chairman of the irrigation committee. He was also appointed to the engrossed bills and food and dairy products committees. In 1920, he decided not run for re-election. 

Later life.
After finishing his second term in the House, Merryman remained active in Republican politics, serving as a member of state central committee. He also ventured into business. He was a founding partner of the Crater Lake Box Company, located in Bray, <a href="California">California</a>. He took an active part in the company’s management until the facility burned in 1928. While the lumberyard was saved, the structural loss was estimated to be $100,000. After the fire, Merryman and his partners decided not to rebuild the plant. Merryman also served on the Oregon Bank and Trust Company’s board of directors, becoming chairman of the board in 1932.

Merryman continued his Klamath Falls medical practice throughout his life. He built Hillside Hospital in 1929. The hospital opened on 1 May with over 2,000 people touring the new facility on opening day. It was the first hospital in the city to be certified by the <a href="Joint%20Commission">Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals</a>. Merryman ran the hospital until it was sold in 1946. He also continued to stay up-to-date on medical practices attending postgraduate medical courses and clinics in places like in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and <a href="Vienna%2C%20Austria">Vienna</a>, <a href="Austria">Austria</a>.

Merryman died on 6 May 1948 at his Hillside Hospital in Klamath Fall. He was 69 years old at the time of his death. A <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> service was held for him at a local chapel. He was then interred in a family plot at the Linkville Pioneer Cemetery in Klamath Falls. In his <a href="Will%20and%20testament">will</a>, Merryman left his entire estate, valued at approximately $40,000, to his wife Mabel.

Romanian Navy during World War II

The <a href="Romanian%20Navy">Romanian Navy</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> was the main Axis naval force in the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and fought against the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s <a href="Black%20Sea%20Fleet">Black Sea Fleet</a> from 1941 to 1944. 

Romanian Black Sea Fleet.
At the start of the War in September 1939, the Romanian Black Sea Fleet mainly consisted of: 4 destroyers (two <a href="M%C4%83r%C4%83%C8%99ti-class%20destroyer">"Mărăști"-class</a> and two <a href="Regele%20Ferdinand-class%20destroyer">"Regele Ferdinand"-class</a>), 3 torpedo boats (<a href="250t-class%20torpedo%20boat%23Post-World%20War%20I%20transfers">250t-class</a>), 3 motor torpedo boats (Vospers), 4 escort and patrol gunboats (ex-French "Friponne"-class), 1 minelayer ("<a href="NMS%20Amiral%20Murgescu">Amiral Murgescu</a>") and 1 submarine ("<a href="NMS%20Delfinul">Delfinul</a>"). Wartime additions to the fleet included: 7 submarines ("<a href="NMS%20Rechinul">Rechinul</a>", "<a href="NMS%20Marsuinul">Marsuinul</a>" and five <a href="CB-class%20midget%20submarine">"CB"-class</a>) and 6 torpedo boats (Dutch-designed, Romanian-built). In addition, four cargo ships of the Romanian Merchant Marine were converted to auxiliary minelayers and served alongside the Romanian Navy.

Operations in the Black Sea.
Beginning and main engagement.
The naval war in the Black Sea commenced with the Raid on Constanța on 26 June 1941, the only encounter between major warships during the entire campaign. The Romanian destroyers "Mărăști" and "Regina Maria" together with the minelayer "Amiral Murgescu" defended the port against the Soviet cruiser <a href="Soviet%20cruiser%20Voroshilov">"Voroshilov"</a> and the <a href="Leningrad-class%20destroyer%20leader">"Leningrad"-class</a> destroyer leaders "Kharkov" and "Moskva". The Romanian warships were supported by coastal artillery, including the German coastal battery <a href="German%20coastal%20battery%20Tirpitz">"Tirpitz"</a> (nominally under Romanian command) and the Soviet warships by <a href="Tupolev%20SB">Tupolev SB</a> bombers. The raid was a Soviet failure, only amounting to several fuel tanks set on fire. No Romanian warship was sunk while the Soviet destroyer leader "Moskva" was lost to a Romanian minefield as she was avoiding fire from the Romanian destroyers and coastal artillery.

Other engagements.
On 9 July 1941, near the Romanian <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> port of <a href="Mangalia">Mangalia</a>, the Romanian gunboat "Stihi" informed the Romanian <a href="250t-class%20torpedo%20boat">250t-class torpedo boat</a> "Năluca" and motor torpedo boats "Viscolul" and "Vijelia" that the periscope of an enemy submarine was sighted near the harbor. In the ensuing battle, the Soviet <a href="Shchuka-class%20submarine">Shchuka-class submarine</a> "Shch-206" was attacked by "Năluca", at first with 20 mm rounds and then with depth charges, eventually being sunk with all hands.

On 17 December 1941 near the <a href="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a>n coast, the Romanian destroyer "Regele Ferdinand", while escorting a convoy of Bulgarian and Hungarian cargo ships, depth-charged and sank the <a href="Soviet%20M-class%20submarine">Soviet M-class submarine</a> "M-59", after the latter unsuccessfully attacked the convoy with torpedoes.

On 1 October, the Soviet submarine "M-118" attacked and sank the German transport ship "Salzburg". After attacking, the submarine was located by a German <a href="Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss%20BV%20138">BV138C</a> flying boat, and the Romanian gunboats "Sublocotenent Ghiculescu" and "Stihi Eugen" were sent to the scene. The two Romanian warships attacked the submarine with depth charges, sinking her with all hands.

Two naval actions involving the Romanian Navy took place near <a href="Sevastopol">Sevastopol</a> during the April–May 1944 <a href="Crimean%20Offensive">evacuation of Crimea</a>. On 18 April, the Soviet <a href="Leninets-class%20submarine">"Leninets"-class</a> submarine "L-6" was twice attacked with depth charges and damaged by the Romanian gunboat "Ghiculescu", numerous bubbles emerged from the depths after each attack, before being finished off by the German submarine hunter "UJ-104". During the night of 27 April, a convoy escorted by the Romanian gunboat "Ghiculescu", the German submarine hunter "UJ-115", one <a href="R-boat">R-boat</a>, two KFK <a href="naval%20trawler">naval trawler</a>s and 19 <a href="Marinef%C3%A4hrprahm">MFP</a>s (including the Romanian "PTA-404" and "PTA-406") engaged the Soviet <a href="G-5-class%20motor%20torpedo%20boat">G-5-class motor torpedo boat</a>s "TKA-332" and "TKA-334", after the two attacked and damaged the German submarine hunter "UJ-104". "Ghiculescu" fired tracer rounds from her 88 mm gun, enabling the entire escort group to locate the two Soviet MTBs and open fire. "TKA-332" was hit and sunk.

Mine warfare.
The majority of naval losses, both inflicted and suffered by the Romanian Navy, were caused by naval mines.

Days before <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>, between 16 and 19 June 1941, the Romanian minelayer "Amiral Murgescu" along with two auxiliary minelayers laid a barrage of 1,000 mines off Constanța, and it was these mines that would sink "Moskva" one week later. Throughout the war, the mines laid off Constanța also sank four Soviet submarines ("<a href="Soviet%20submarine%20Shch-213">Shch-213</a>", "M-58", "M-34" and "Shch-208").

Between 7 and 16 October 1941, "Amiral Murgescu" along with two auxiliary minelayers, all three escorted escorted by the Romanian <a href="250t-class%20torpedo%20boat">250t-class</a> torpedo boats "Năluca", "Sborul" and "Smeul", the Romanian gunboats "Sublocotenent Ghiculescu" and "Căpitan Dumitrescu" and the Bulgarian torpedo boats <a href="Bulgarian%20torpedo%20boat%20Drazki">"Drazki"</a>, "Smeli" and "Hrabri", laid four full minefields and one partial minefield along the Bulgarian coast. These mines later sank four Soviet submarines (the <a href="Soviet%20S-class%20submarine">S-class</a> "S-34", "L-24", "Shch-210" and "Shch-211").

On 9 November 1941, the Romanian motor torpedo boats "Viforul" and "Vijelia" were sunk near Odessa by Soviet mines.

On 24 June 1942, "Amiral Murgescu" along with one auxiliary minelayer laid mines off <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a>, while being escorted by the Romanian destroyers "Regele Ferdinand", "Regina Maria" and "Mărășești", the Romanian gunboats "Ghiculescu", "Stihi" and "Dumitrescu" and the Romanian torpedo boat "<a href="NMS%20Smeul">Smeul</a>", as well as German motor minesweepers of the Donau Flotilla. The mines laid near Odessa later sank the Soviet submarines "M-33" and "M-60" and the motor gunboats "YA-26" and "YA-27".

On 29–30 October and 5 November 1942, "Amiral Murgescu" along with one auxiliary minelayer, escorted by the Romanian destroyers "Regina Maria", "Regele Ferdinand" and "Mărăști", the Romanian gunboat "Stihi" and four German R-boats laid two mine barrages to protect <a href="Snake%20Island%20%28Black%20Sea%29">Snake Island</a>. These mines sank the Soviet submarine "Shch-212" on 11 December that same year. The Soviet submarine "M-31" was either sunk as well by the Romanian mine barrages near the island on 17 December, or sunk with depth charges by the Romanian destroyer "Mărășești" on 7 July 1943.

Aftermath.
Romania <a href="King%20Michael%27s%20Coup">capitulated on 23 August 1944</a>, in the aftermath of a successful <a href="Second%20Jassy-Kishinev%20Offensive">Soviet land offensive</a>. On 20 August, the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a> carried out a large air raid against Constanța, sinking the Romanian torpedo boat "Năluca". Uniquely, in the Second World War, the Romanian Navy was the only navy to fight for over three years without losing a single unit of its main force of destroyers and submarines. 

Starting September 1944, the Soviet Navy moved all Romanian warships to <a href="Caucasus">Caucasian</a> ports. They were not returned until after the war. The older vessels were received in September 1945, while the more modern ones (such as the "Regele Ferdinand"-class) were kept by the Soviet Black Sea Fleet until the early 1950s. A number of warships (such as "Amiral Murgescu") were never returned.

SS Dorrigo

The SS "Dorrigo" was originally built under the name of "Saint Francois" by the Smiths Dock Company at the South Bank in Middlesbrough on the River Tees in Northeast England for the Pacific Island postal and general trade service for Compagnie Navale de l'Océanie where it plied the waters of the pacific from 1914 to 1921. It suffered minor damage in WWI during the Bombardment of Papeete prior to the vessel coming into the hands of the Langley Bros who placed it in the Sydney to Coffs harbour route from 1922 to 1925. Upon the demise of the Langley Bros shipping firm in 1925 the vessel came into the service John Burke and Co and for the Northern Queensland runs prior to its loss on the 4 April 1926

Ship description and construction.
The ship builder.
The SS "Dorrigo" was originally built under the name of "Saint Francois" by the <a href="Smiths%20Dock%20Company">Smiths Dock Company</a> established by Thomas Smith who bought William Rowe's shipyard at St. Peter's in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1810 and traded as William Smith & Co. The company became associated with South Bank in Middlesbrough on the River Tees in Northeast England, after opening an operation there in 1907. Smiths Dock increasingly concentrated its shipbuilding business at South Bank, with its North Shields Yard being used mainly for repair work.

Ship description.
The vessel was described as being a fine type of modern passenger and cargo steamer. She was specifically built for the mail service between the <a href="French%20Polynesia">French Islands</a> and had comfortable first class accommodation for 25 passengers situated in the deck, amidships, with electric bells, lights and fans to each berth. Adjoining the dining saloon which was also on the deck, was a stately smoke lounge room. The vessel also had accommodation for 20 second-class passengers, which was situated under the <a href="promenade%20deck">promenade deck</a> and described as in keeping with the first-class accommodation in the matter of comfort.
The vessel is fitted with a powerful searchlight and wireless, and she is replete with all the latest appliances.

The vessel was a steel single deck and the bridge ship with two masts. Its dimensions were:

Ship service history.
The steamer "Saint Francois", Pacific Service with Compagnie Navale de l'Océanie 1913 - 1922.
In November 1914 "Saint Francois" arrived in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a> from <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> to undergo a general overhaul 

The fine little passenger and cargo steamer "Saint Francois", first arrived at <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on Thursday 8 April 1915 from Tahiti, via <a href="Noum%C3%A9a">Nouméa</a>, with 350 tons of <a href="copra">copra</a>, the steamer was normally engaged in the inter-island trade between Tahiti and other South Sea islands 

The "Saint Francois" next arrived In Sydney from Nouméa to undergo repairs to her stern in late February 1916, which had been considerably damaged in Tahiti, with the estimate of the cost of the work is £2000 

In April 1916 the "Saint Francois" was involved in the rescue of the Steamer "Flora" had left Auckland on April 11 for the Eastern Pacific, and all went well until the "Flora" was about; 150 miles out from <a href="Rarotonga">Rarotonga</a>, en route for <a href="Raiatea">Raiatea</a>, when one of the two crank-shaft broke. When the mishap occurred the engineers of the "Flora" set to work to try to effect repairs. For four and a half days and nights the "Flora" drifted, while the engineers toiled in the sweltering heat of the engine room. On the fifth day temporary repairs were effected, and the vessel was once more brought under control. Two hours and a half later the rivets joining the broken shaft gave way, and the "Flora" again commenced to drift. It was fortunate that shortly afterwards she came into touch with the French steamer "Saint Francois". Up to this time the weather had been fine, but when the "Saint Francois" hove into sight there were lowering clouds, and every indication of a storm. The Flora was taken in tow and <a href="Papeete">Papeete</a> was reached three days and three hours later, the distance of 437 miles being covered at an average speed of 5¾ miles per hour 

During 1920 the "Saint Francois" was involved in towing both of the <a href="Hulk%20%28ship%20type%29">Hulks</a> "Pey Berland" and "Chateau Baret" (Formerly the British Barque "Cadwgan") back to <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> of which both Hulks typically imported Chromium ore into Australia and took Coal back to New Caledonia 

WWI Service.
In October 1914 the C&O companies "Saint Francois" arrived in Auckland from Raratonga for repairs, coal and water, The crew gave statements that the capital of Tahiti <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Papeete">Papeete had been bombarded by German warships</a>. A ricocheting shell had struck the funnel of the "Saint Francois" with another hole also in the vessels hull above the water line. Additionally some the vessel underwent repairs for a grounding some
months prior as well as survey 

Langley W. & Sons Service 1922 - 1925.
In October 1921 Messrs. Langley Bros. purchased the "Saint Francois" and renamed the vessel "Dorrigo" to replace the ill-fated <a href="Fitzroy%20%281912%29">"Fitzroy"</a>, which foundered off the coast the previous June and the vessel was placed into the same <a href="Coffs%20Harbour">Coffs Harbour</a> to Sydney route. At this time the vessel was also modified with part of the after hold being converted into a butter chamber, to be able to carry 5,000 boxes of butter, to meet the increasing coastal trade.

On Thursday 9 December the "Dorrigo" first arrived on its maiden run for <a href="Woolgoolga%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Woolgoolga</a> and Coffs Harbour for the passenger and cargo traffic trade between Sydney with an open invitation to visit and inspect her during the morning was extended to the public. The vessel was described as to all intents and purposes a new ship and representing the last word in comfort for the coastal service, and capable of covering the distance between Coffs Harbour and Sydney in about 17 hours 

By April 1925 the shipping firm of Langley Bros, went into voluntary liquidation with the shipping fleet offered for sale by public tender following serious competition from the New South Wales Government railways in the Coff's Harbour trade. The Dorrigo had been laid up since December 1924 owing to the falling off in passenger receipts 

John Burke and Co Ltd Service 1925.
In July 1925 it was announced that The passenger steamer "Dorrigo", which since 1921 has been engaged in the passenger and cargo service between Sydney and Coff's Harbour, had been purchased by John Burke, Ltd., for use in trade between <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> and North Queensland ports the vessel had only recently been purchased by the <a href="North%20Coast%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company">North Coast Steam Navigation Company</a>, with other vessels of the Langley fleet. The vessel was intended to run between Brisbane and <a href="Cooktown%2C%20Queensland">Cooktown</a>, via ports, and expected to extend her sailings to <a href="Thursday%20Island">Thursday Island</a>, when cargoes warrant it 

Upon arrival of the cargo steamer "Dorrigo" at <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> in September 1925 the cargo was declared "black" by the waterside workers who were engaged in a dispute and who then decided not to remove the cargo from Brisbane of which there were 100 tons for Cairns. The ship left again for Brisbane via <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a> and <a href="Bowen%2C%20Queensland">Bowen</a> with the Cairns cargo still aboard 

Sinking of the SS Dorrigo.
The "Dorrigo" left Brisbane at 7 pm on April 1 for Thursday Island and intermediate northern ports carried a crew of 24, most of whom were residents of Brisbane and with between 500 - 600 tons of general cargo, including some benzene and kerosene.

When the "Dorrigo" was ready to leave Brisbane on Thursday afternoon it was reported to the master that one of the firemen was ill. He was given attention, but his condition was such that it was deemed advisable to take him ashore. In his stead J. Wrench, a well-known seafarer, of Brisbane, joined the ship ten minutes before it sailed.

The steamer "Dorrigo" foundered at 6 am on Good Friday April 2, 1926 off Double Island Point

The first report of the disaster was not 'flashed across' the seas until an early hour on Saturday night. Then the lighthouse at Double Island Point had flashed to him a hurried alarm and a call of the mariner's "S.O.S." This was followed by a despatch' intimating briefly the first news of the wreck. Within three hours of the flashed of the first word Brisbane was advised

It was reported by the Captain of the "Dorrigo" that the vessel had founded with Double Island Point lighthouse, bearing north-west 14 miles. The Steamer "Moruya" had picked up a raft with Captain C. W. Gray and his son W. E. Gray on board 

The cargo from the Dorrigo had been washed ashore along a ten-mile stretch of beach at Fraser's Island. Cabin doors, cased goods and kerosene were included in the wreckage, but the searchers had failed in their search for survivors

It was claimed at the time by Mr. J. E. Burke, the governing director of John Burke, Limited shipping company that the Dorrigo "was exceedingly sea worthy and we were perfectly satisfied, with her. I cannot understand how the vessel foundered, more particularly as last week she was in the cyclone that dealt severely with the Cooma, and she entered port only a few hours late. She was a speedy vessel, and invariably did the trip from Brisbane to Sydney in 41 or 42 hours. These facts, combined with the knowledge that she was on her second voyage since her last overhaul, leads me to" believe that something very remarkable lies contributed to her destruction." 

It was reported that the Captain and his son had survived the wreck and 30 hours lost at sea with 3 ft to 12 ft in length tiger sharks nosing around the make shift raft-of the aft deck sun awning-upon which Captain Gray and his son floated after the steamer Dorrigo had foundered

Le Temps restitué

Le Temps restitué (Time Regiven) is a work for mezzo-soprano solo, choir, and orchestra by the French composer <a href="Jean%20Barraqu%C3%A9">Jean Barraqué</a>. It was both the first part to have been begun and the last one to be completed in his projected but unfinished cycle of works based on <a href="Hermann%20Broch">Hermann Broch</a>’s novel, "<a href="The%20Death%20of%20Virgil">The Death of Virgil</a>". A performance lasts about forty minutes.

History.
In March 1956, Barraqué first formed a plan to set passages, in the French translation by Albert Kohn, from the second book of Hermann Broch’s novel "The Death of Virgil", and straightaway began composing "Le Temps restitué". He finished a first draft in Paris on 20 October 1957, and then added a new beginning and cover page dated 11 December of the same year. In this respect, it forms the basis for all the subsequent works in the cycle . He then devised a revised plan for the cycle which included details of the intended orchestration of "Le Temps restitué", but set aside the draft in favour of other projects. It was only in the summer of 1967 that the offer of a performance at next year’s <a href="Royan%20Festival">Royan Festival</a> rekindled Barraqué’s interest and he resumed work on the score, completing it in Florence on 8 February 1968. The first performance took place on 4 April 1968, as part of the Royan Festival. <a href="Helga%20Pilarczyk">Helga Pilarczyk</a> was the soprano soloist, with members of the French Radio Choir (prepared by Jean-Paul Kréder) and the Ensemble du Domaine Musical, conducted by <a href="Gilbert%20Amy">Gilbert Amy</a>. The same forces gave the first Paris performance at a <a href="Domaine%20Musical">Domaine Musical</a> concert in the <a href="Od%C3%A9on-Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20de%20l%27Europe">Théâtre de l’Odéon</a> on 25 April 1968. There was only one further performance during the composer’s lifetime, on 9 April 1973, at the <a href="Office%20de%20Radiodiffusion%20T%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision%20Fran%C3%A7aise">Maison de l’O.R.T.F.</a> in Paris with Anne Bartelloni (soprano), the French Radio chamber choir (using three voices on a part instead of twelve soloists), and the Ars Nova ensemble, conducted by Jean-Paul Kréder (; ). The third performance was the US premiere, and took place on 10 August 1978 at the <a href="Tanglewood%20Music%20Festival">Tanglewood Music Festival</a> in Lenox, Massachusetts, with the Berkshire Music Center Orchestra conducted by <a href="Gunther%20Schuller">Gunther Schuller</a> (; ).

On 1 October 1970, Barraqué began what was meant to be a related work, titled "Arraché de … commentaire en forme de lecture du Temps restitué", but it did not extend beyond a preliminary sketch for clarinets on three staves and the entry of an SATB chorus marked "Sprechstimme. Imprecise pitches but different in pitch register" .

Analysis.
The work is in five movements, performed without a break:
It is scored for solo mezzo-soprano, a choir of twelve solo singers, and an orchestra of twenty-eight players made up of roughly equal numbers of woodwinds, strings, and percussion .

The text is taken from a passage in Broch’s novel where <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, alone in his room, late at night, contemplates the stars from his window. It is a meditation on the marriage of law and time, of the inevitable and the unpredictable . It follows the linear arrangement of about six pages of Broch's text. The texts of the first, third, and fifth movements are three <a href="Elegy">elegies</a> in verse, taken without alteration from Broch’s novel. The second and fourth movements intersperse lightly edited prose passages from Broch’s surrounding narrative framework. Barraqué's omissions from the prose texts avoid many typical Brochian stylistic features in favour of its distinctive rhythm, retaining aspects of designation, assertion, and description. The syntax of the French translation permits Barraqué to end on the words "ouvert à la connaissance" (open to perception), which would not have been possible in the German original. In this way, "réconfort terrestre" (consolation in the earthly) becomes more important than the opening to perception .

The first movement opens with an orchestral introduction, followed by a four-voiced chorus in shifting tempos. The second movement is slower, with the solo soprano singing for the first time, against an orchestral accompaniment. The movement ends with the words "libérée du hasard" (freed from chance) which, in Broch’s novel, lead directly into the second elegy. The third movement, setting this elegy, is longer and more complex, questioning how eternal truth is to be found within human mutability. The chorus sings four independent layers of text in twelve parts, "colliding and chaotic" (according to the score's instructions) against the soprano’s cantabile, then adopts a more settled four-part texture to complete the movement as an <a href="aria">aria</a> with choral accompaniment. The fourth movement returns to the slower tempo and fragmented manner of the second movement, only now adding the chorus to the soprano and orchestra. It consists of two large sections of text setting, separated by a two-minute wordless interlude for chorus and orchestra. The concluding text once again ends with the words Broch uses to introduce the following elegiac verse “car ce n'est que dans l'erreur, ce n'est que par erreur” (because only amidst error, it is only through error). The final verse setting is slower still, though with constantly changing tempos. The soloist appears less often in this movement, while the choir is texturally more complex, at one point presenting twelve different lines of text simultaneously .

Tay-K

Taymor Travon Mcintyre (born June 16, 2000) better known by his stage name Tay-K is an American rapper from <a href="Arlington%2C%20Texas">Arlington, Texas</a>. He is best known for his hit song "The Race" which charted at number 70 on the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> following Mcintyre's arrest in <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a> after a nation-wide manhunt.

Early life.
Taymor Travon Mcintyre was born on June 16, 2000 in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a>. Mcintyre's mother was a <a href="Crips">crip</a> and Mcintyre father, who was born in Compton, was imprisoned during Mcintyre's youth. Mcintyre moved to <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas, Nevada</a> with his sister when he was eight years old. When Mcintyre's father was released from prison, he moved the family to <a href="Arlington%2C%20Texas">Arlington, Texas</a> in search of a "better environment."

Career.
Mcintyre started his rap career as part of the rap group, "Daytona Boyz" alongside rappers Pimpyz and Santana Sage. The group released their first track "Drift" on audio distribution platform, <a href="SoundCloud">SoundCloud</a> in December 2014. The group released a series of songs, barely getting attention as they performed at various parties attempting to create a presence in the local rap scenes.

Mcintyre released his first solo song in mid-2015 titled "BIFF XANNEN" on his soundcloud account. The song, along with Sly Cooper which was released in November 2015 was able to garner local attention within the <a href="Arlington%2C%20Texas">Arlington</a> rap scene. Mcintyre's song "Megaman" was released on his Soundcloud in 2016 and along with several other songs Mcintyre released, became popular after he was arrested on <a href="capital%20murder">capital murder</a> charges.

Mcintyre released several songs whilst on the run from the police, including "The Race" which was recorded during Mcintyre's stay in New Jersey and the music video was released on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> two weeks before his capture. "The Race" debuted at number 70 on the on the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> after a large hashtag campaign pursuing the release of McIntyre using the hashtag "#FREETAYK"

While incarcerated, Mcintyre released the mixtape, "#SantanaWorld".

Legal issues.
Mcintyre has a history of legal troubles. The first reported case of Mcintyre and his criminal interactions was when he was a witness to the shooting of 20 year old Sara Mutschlechner by Daytona Boyz member Eric Johnson also known by his stage name Satana Sage. Mcintyre and Johnson had attended the same party as Mutschlechner, not interacting until they had left. Johnson was driving through <a href="Denton%2C%20Texas">Denton</a> when his black <a href="Sport%20utility%20vehicle">SUV</a> pulled up along Mutschlechner's <a href="Sedan%20%28automobile%29">Sedan</a>. Mcintyre and other Daytona Boyz member Pimpyz began to call out to Mutschlechner's Sedan which led to a man rolling a window down and confronting them. Johnson then threatened to shoot the male which led to Mutschlechner driving away. The SUV chased Mutschlechner and Johnson then fired two shots, one entering Mutschlechner's head. Johnson confessed and Mcintyre wasn't charged in the case. Johnson received 44 years in prison.

Mcintyre and six other people were arrested in July 2016 on capital murder charges. On July 25, 2016, Megan Holt and Ariana Bharrat were part of a plan alongside Mcintyre and friends to burgle 21 year old Ethan Walker. The pair planned to seduce Walker and then let the gunmen into the house where they were to steal drugs and money from him before leaving. One of the pair unlocked the door and the gunmen then proceeded to rob Walker, which led to a fatal confrontation and the death of Walker as they were attempting to leave, along with two other non-fatal injuries from gunshot. 

Mcintyre was placed under house arrest until certification hearings were held. A few days before certification hearings were held, Mcintyre and another suspect cut off their ankle monitors and fled to <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio, Texas</a>. Just before cutting his ankle monitor off and going on the run, Mcintyre wrote on Twitter "fuck dis house arrest shit fuck 12 they gn hav 2 catch me on hood". The suspect that Mcintyre fled with was captured in May 2017. Mcintyre made his way to <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a> where he recorded the song "The Race" which described his run from the police and his legal troubles. The song opens with "Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case/but I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race" and repeats it numerous times. On June 30, 2017 Mcintyre was captured by the <a href="United%20States%20Marshals%20Service">U.S Marshal Service</a> in <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a>.

Whilst on-the-run, Mcintyre attacked 65 year old Skip Pete in Cravens Park, <a href="Arlington%2C%20Texas">Arlington</a> on May 25, 2017. Mcintyre allegedly held a gun to Pete's head before knocking him unconscious in the park, only to be found by a runner later on. Pete later identified Mcintyre during a photo lineup.

2017 Australian constitutional crisis

In 2017, the eligibility of Australians with actual or possible <a href="dual%20citizenship">dual citizenship</a> to sit in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Parliament of Australia</a> was called into question, amounting to an ongoing political event referred to by some as the 2017 Australian constitutional crisis or the citizenship crisis. The issue arises from <a href="section%2044%20of%20the%20Constitution%20of%20Australia">section 44 of the Constitution of Australia</a>, which includes a subsection prohibiting allegiance to a foreign power for electoral candidates.

Various cases of elected politicians discovering that they unknowingly hold or may hold dual citizenship have been referred to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a>, however they have yet to be ruled on. As of August 20, Senators <a href="Scott%20Ludlam">Scott Ludlam</a> and <a href="Larissa%20Waters">Larissa Waters</a> of the <a href="Australian%20Greens">Australian Greens</a> have voluntarily resigned their seats, and their cases have been referred to the High Court alongside those of: <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Deputy Prime Minister</a> <a href="Barnaby%20Joyce">Barnaby Joyce</a> and Senators <a href="Matthew%20Canavan">Matt Canavan</a> and <a href="Fiona%20Nash">Fiona Nash</a>, all <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">National Party</a> <a href="Second%20Turnbull%20Ministry">ministers in the Turnbull Government</a>; Senator <a href="Malcolm%20Roberts%20%28politician%29">Malcolm Roberts</a> of <a href="Pauline%20Hanson%27s%20One%20Nation">One Nation</a>; and Senator <a href="Nick%20Xenophon">Nick Xenophon</a>, leader of the <a href="Nick%20Xenophon%20Team">Nick Xenophon Team</a>. While Canavan has resigned from <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Australia">Cabinet</a>, Joyce and Nash have remained in Cabinet with the support of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Malcolm%20Turnbull">Malcolm Turnbull</a>.

There will be a directions hearing for at least some of the cases in the High Court on 24 August. The full Court is scheduled to sit next on 4 to 15 September, then on 9 to 20 October, and <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Australia">Attorney-General</a> <a href="George%20Brandis">George Brandis</a> expects that the hearings will not occur until October.

Background.
<a href="Section%2044%20of%20the%20Constitution%20of%20Australia">Section 44</a> of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Constitution of Australia</a> states:

The wording of this section of the Constitution has cast doubt on the eligibility of several MPs and Senators who may hold citizenship with countries other than Australia, either through failure to <a href="Renunciation%20of%20citizenship">renounce their citizenship</a> of their country of birth or through ignorance of the <a href="Jus%20sanguinis">citizenship by descent</a> laws of their parents' and grandparents' countries of birth. 

Precedent exists of the High Court disqualifying parliamentarians on the grounds of s 44(i). In "Sykes v Cleary", the High Court ruled that both major-party candidates in <a href="Wills%20by-election%2C%201992">a 1992 by-election</a> for the <a href="Division%20of%20Wills">Division of Wills</a> were ineligible to replace the separately ineligible independent <a href="Phil%20Cleary">Phil Cleary</a>; Labor's Bill Kardamitsis and Liberal John Delacretaz failed to renounce their <a href="Greek%20nationality%20law">Greek</a> and <a href="Swiss%20nationality%20law">Swiss citizenships</a> respectively. In addition, the High Court ruled that a candidate who takes "all reasonable steps" to renounce their non-Australian citizenship before their election would not face disqualification. The most immediately relevant case is "<a href="Sue%20v%20Hill">Sue v Hill</a>", in which <a href="London">London</a>-born <a href="Heather%20Hill%20%28politician%29">Heather Hill</a>, elected as a Senator for <a href="Pauline%20Hanson%27s%20One%20Nation">Pauline Hanson's One Nation</a> in <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201998">1998</a>, was ruled to have been invalidly elected and disqualified by the High Court after failing to renounce her <a href="British%20nationality%20law">citizenship with the United Kingdom</a>. Following a <a href="Election%20recount">recount</a>, Hill was replaced by <a href="Len%20Harris%20%28politician%29">Len Harris</a>, the second Senate candidate for One Nation.

In the <a href="45th%20Parliament%20of%20Australia">current Parliament of Australia</a>, following the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202016">2016 election</a>, the <a href="Turnbull%20Government">Turnbull Government</a> holds a one-seat majority in the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, which would be be lost if two government members of the House were to resign due to disqualification. The government would then be vulnerable to an Opposition <a href="motion%20of%20no%20confidence">motion of no confidence</a>, which if carried would require the government to resign. In any case, a <a href="by-election">by-election</a> would be held in any vacated seat and the government's majority would be removed if it lost at least one such election.

Cases.
During 2017 there have arisen several cases of possible breach of s 44(i) and in two cases (Ludlam and Waters) the member has resigned from the Parliament. All cases but one (Joyce) have arisen in the Senate, and all have been referred to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court</a> as <a href="Court%20of%20Disputed%20Returns%20%28Australia%29">Court of Disputed Returns</a>; every reference, both those by the Senate and that by the House of Representatives, has had all-party support.

Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters.
In late June 2017, John Cameron, a barrister from <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, applied to the <a href="Department%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28New%20Zealand%29">New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs</a> to search the register of <a href="New%20Zealand%20nationality%20law">New Zealand citizens</a>. Cameron intended to confirm whether Co-Deputy Leader of the <a href="Australian%20Greens">Greens</a> <a href="Scott%20Ludlam">Scott Ludlam</a> and founder of the <a href="Derryn%20Hinch%27s%20Justice%20Party">Justice Party</a> <a href="Derryn%20Hinch">Derryn Hinch</a>, both incumbent Australian Senators who were born in New Zealand, had renounced their New Zealand citizenships as required under s 44(i). Upon discovering that Ludlam, unlike Hinch, had not renounced his New Zealand citizenship, Cameron notified the <a href="Clerk%20of%20the%20Australian%20Senate">Clerk of the Australian Senate</a> and Ludlam.

On 14 July 2017, Scott Ludlam announced that he still retained New Zealand citizenship from his birth in New Zealand. Ludlam had settled in Australia with his family aged eight, and had previously assumed he lost his New Zealand citizenship when he naturalised as an Australian citizen in his mid-teens. It is expected that Ludlam will be found to have been ineligible to be elected, requiring the seat to be filled by a recount of the <a href="Results%20for%20the%20Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202016%20%28Senate%29%23Western%20Australia">2016 federal election</a>. The next un-elected Greens candidate on the Senate ticket in Western Australia was <a href="Jordon%20Steele-John">Jordon Steele-John</a>, a 22-year-old disability rights advocate, who will become Australia's youngest senator in history if he replaces Ludlam.

The revelation prompted Ludlam's fellow co-deputy leader of the Greens, Senator <a href="Larissa%20Waters">Larissa Waters</a>, to similarly discover that she held Canadian citizenship, and to resign four days after Ludlam. Waters was born to Australian parents who were briefly living in Canada, and returned with them to Australia while still a baby. She had previously believed that she was solely an Australian citizen, and that if she had wished to gain Canadian citizenship she would have needed to taken active steps before age 21. However, she discovered she had in fact always held dual citizenship since birth. Her seat is also likely to be filled by a recount, giving former <a href="Australian%20Democrats">Democrats</a> leader <a href="Andrew%20Bartlett">Andrew Bartlett</a>, who held the second position after Waters on the Greens' 2016 Senate ticket in Queensland, a high chance of returning to the Senate.

On 8 August 2017 the Senate resolved, with all-party support, to refer the matters of Ludlam and Waters, as well as that of Matthew Canavan, to the High Court as Court of Disputed Returns.

Matthew Canavan.
On 25 July 2017, <a href="Liberal%20National%20Party%20of%20Queensland">Liberal National Party</a> Senator <a href="Matthew%20Canavan">Matthew Canavan</a> resigned from his positions of <a href="Minister%20for%20Industry%2C%20Innovation%20and%20Science%23Energy%20and%20Resources">Minister for Resources</a> and <a href="Minister%20for%20Home%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29%23List%20of%20ministers%20with%20responsibility%20for%20northern%20Australia">Northern Australia</a> in the Cabinet over doubts as to his eligibility to be a member of the parliament, after discovering that he was considered by the Italian authorities to be a citizen of Italy.

Canavan's mother had registered him as an <a href="Resident_registration%23Italy">Italian resident abroad</a> with the Italian consulate in Brisbane in 2006. Canavan stated he was unaware of this until his mother was prompted to inform him following news of the <a href="Section_44_of_the_Constitution_of_Australia%23Scott_Ludlam_and_Larissa_Waters_.282017.29">resignation of two Greens senators</a> holding dual citizenship. The government has taken the view that he is not in breach of the Constitution as the registration was not made with Canavan's knowledge or consent.

On 8 August 2017, with all-party support, the Senate referred the position of Canavan, along with the cases of Ludlam and Waters, to the High Court as Court of Disputed Returns. The Attorney-General indicated that the Commonwealth will argue, in favour of Cavanan, that s 44(i) requires a personal acknowledgement of the connection. Canavan spoke in support but stated that he would not be voting in the Senate until the High Court decision.

Malcolm Roberts.
Senator <a href="Malcolm%20Roberts%20%28politician%29">Malcolm Roberts</a> of the <a href="One%20Nation%20%28Australia%29">One Nation</a> party was born in India of an Australian mother and a British father. Roberts is an Australian citizen, and in August 2017 documents were revealed by <a href="BuzzFeed">BuzzFeed</a> indicating that Roberts was a British citizen at the age of 19. Roberts stated that he had only ever been an Australian and that, in case he ever had British citizenship, before the 2016 election he took reasonable steps to renounce it. Doubts have been cast upon his view of the position. 

On 9 August the Senate, with all-party support, referred his position to the High Court as Court of Disputed Returns. The reference was moved by Roberts's party leader <a href="Pauline%20Hanson">Pauline Hanson</a>, with his support. He did not respond to a question in the Senate whether he would be voting before the Court's decision.

Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash.
On 14 August 2017, Deputy Prime Minister <a href="Barnaby%20Joyce">Barnaby Joyce</a> (leader of the <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">National Party of Australia</a> and member of the House of Representatives) announced that the New Zealand government had informed him that he might be a citizen of New Zealand by descent from his father; he stated that he was "shocked to receive this information". At his request, the government moved in the House of Representatives that Joyce's position be referred to the High Court as Court of Disputed Returns, which was carried with all-party support. Prime Minister <a href="Malcolm%20Turnbull">Malcolm Turnbull</a> stated that legal advice from the <a href="Solicitor-General%20of%20Australia">Solicitor-General</a> confirmed Joyce's eligibility, but refused to release that advice or to say how it may have distinguished Joyce's position from that of Canavan. Joyce has now renounced his New Zealand citizenship and produced documentary evidence of having done so. He has not resigned from his ministerial offices and will continue to vote in Parliament. The <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20House">Leader of the House</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Pyne">Christopher Pyne</a>, named four <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> members of the House whose positions under s 44(i) he claimed to require explanation and suggested that there are "many more" among the Opposition. Leading experts on constitutional law do not share the government's confidence about Joyce's eligibility.

Three days later on 17 August, 2017, Nationals deputy leader and Senator, <a href="Fiona%20Nash">Fiona Nash</a> revealed that she had British citizenship by descent through her <a href="Scottish">Scottish</a> father. She has elected not to step down from leadership or cabinet while she is referred to the High Court.

Nick Xenophon.
Senator <a href="Nick%20Xenophon">Nick Xenophon</a> leads the <a href="Nick%20Xenophon%20Team">Nick Xenophon Team</a> party, which has three seats in the Senate and one in the House. In August 2017 he was asked whether he might have acquired Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek who was born in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said that he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding that he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August he announced that British authorities had confirmed that he is a <a href="British%20Overseas%20citizen">British Overseas citizen</a>, a lesser form of <a href="British%20nationality%20law">British nationality</a>. He will not resign from the Parliament, but will await a High Court decision.

New Zealand political row.
A row ensued between the Australian Government and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a> after it was reported that a staff member for an Australian Labor senator had asked a New Zealand MP to find out whether or not the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, Barnaby Joyce, was a citizen of that country. Australian Foreign Minister <a href="Julie%20Bishop">Julie Bishop</a> accused New Zealand's Labour Party of being "involved in allegations designed to undermine the government of Australia" and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull accused the Australian Labor Party of conspiring "with a foreign power". This claim was outright refused by the New Zealand Minister of Internal Affairs, <a href="Peter%20Dunne">Peter Dunne</a>, as well as <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20New%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party">NZ Labour Leader</a> <a href="Jacinda%20Ardern">Jacinda Ardern</a>.

Implications for parliamentary majority.
On August 15, 2017, <a href="Bob%20Katter">Bob Katter</a>, the sole MP of <a href="Katter%27s%20Australian%20Party">Katter's Australian Party</a>, announced that he was withdrawing his support for the <a href="Turnbull%20Government">Turnbull Government</a> as a result of this scandal. Additionally, <a href="Rebekha%20Sharkie">Rebekha Sharkie</a>, the sole MP in the House of Representatives for the <a href="Nick%20Xenophon%20Team">Nick Xenophon Team</a>, also announced that she would no longer support the Government on matters of confidence and supply on 18 August. This leaves only one crossbench MP, independent <a href="Cathy%20McGowan%20%28politician%29">Cathy McGowan</a>, who has indicated she will maintain '<a href="confidence%20and%20supply">confidence and supply</a>' for the Turnbull Government, meaning that if MP Barnaby Joyce is disqualified from Parliament, the government will still have the confidence of a majority of members. However, the disqualification of any additional government members, or Joyce's defeat in a consequent <a href="Division%20of%20New%20England">Division of New England</a> by-election, could prove fatal to a government with a one-seat majority and limited <a href="Crossbencher">crossbench</a> support.

Radio San Paolo

The Regio Marina Radiotelegraphic Station , better known as Radio San Paolo, was an <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> military broadcaster and military reception center in the long, medium and short wave located on the southern outskirts of <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Inaugurated in <a href="1917">1917</a> under the command of <a href="Regia%20Marina">Regia Marina</a>, the station remained in service to the <a href="Navy">Navy</a> for much of the Second <a href="World%20war">World War</a> and then lost its importance until the disposal and transformation of its premises into civilian flats.

History.
The center was established towards the end of the first decade of the <a href="20th%20century">twentieth century</a> to intensify communications with the colonies Italian on the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>. 
The chosen location was along <a href="Via%20Ostiensis">Via Ostiense</a> at the height of the current building 204, in an uninhabited area, about 250 meters beyond the <a href="Basilica%20of%20St.%20Paulinus%2C%20Trier">basilica of St. Paul</a> in the direction of the sea; the systems installed therein, under the supervision of Giancarlo Vallauri and lieutenants of vessel Giuseppe Pession and Bernardo Micchiardi, were high-power transmitters (250 kW ) in <a href="Longwave">long waves</a> arched Poulsen on the frequencies from 42.9 to 27.3 KHz (equal to 7,000 to 11,000 meters wavelength) Emitted by a triangular antenna supported by three iron trusses about 200 meters high along the Valco di San Paolo; Such a configuration was already at the time reaching the <a href="Massawa">Massaua</a> and <a href="Mogadishu">Mogadiscio</a> radio stations. The radio was also used for civil purposes, in particular to keep in touch with the diplomatic corps abroad.

Between <a href="1926">1926</a> and <a href="1927">1927</a>, to deal with the problems of disruption and monsoons that fell on the eastern coast of <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, the station was also equipped with a <a href="Shortwave%20radio">shortwave</a> plant from 6 kW to 32 (~ 9 300 kHz) And a further long wave system at 10 750 meters (28 kHz) and one in medium waves at 2 250 (~ 133 kHz) and 4,800 meters (~ 62 kHz) on 66 meters (~ 4 500 kHz)  It came in 1928  .

The St. Paul became famous radio station in 1928, held the connections to the support ship "City of Milan", that in 'Atlantic North was conducting research for <a href="Umberto%20Nobile">Umberto Nobile</a> and his crew after the disaster of the airship <a href="Italy">Italy</a> to the <a href="North%20Pole">north pole</a>; When the young Soviet Nikolay Schmidt, near Arcangelo, captured the SOS signal launched by the expedition Marxist Giuseppe Biagi after days of unsuccessful attempts by the latter, he made contact with the Roma San Paolo station by sending him frequency and coordinating and allowing the "City of Milan" to establish direct contact with the survivors of the crew and bring to good-term relief, physically carried by the icebreaker Soviet Krasin.

After September 8, 1943 and the fall of <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in German hands, the radio, which was a strategic objective of ensuring communications with most of the fleet, was militarily occupied by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi troops</a>.

After the end of the war and the urbanization of the area, in particular with the construction of the INA and IACP houses in Valco San Paolo in the early 1950s, the station was resized to the final closing. Nowadays the artifacts that survive are partly used for civilian housing and, in the other, the headquarters of the <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> <a href="culture">culture</a> circle <a href="Mario%20Mieli">Mario Mieli</a>.

Rock inscriptions of the Grama Bay

The rock inscriptions of the Grama Bay (Albanian "mbishkrimet shkëmbore në Gjirin e Gramës") is an archaeological site in Southwestern <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="Vlor%C3%AB%20County">Vlorë County</a>, in the <a href="Grama%20Bay">Grama Bay</a> located on the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian coast</a> of the <a href="Karaburun%20Peninsula%2C%20Albania">Karaburun Mountains</a>, including roughly 1,500 <a href="epigraphy">rock inscriptions</a> that date from the 3rd century BC to the 15th-16th centuries. The name of the bay originates from the Greek word "γράμμα" meaning ’letter’.

The little bay with difficult overland access but with abundant springs had always been a favorite stopping place and shelter for the ones sailing along the coast: mariners, soldiers, merchants and pirates. The city of <a href="Oricum">Oricum</a>, located 12 kms to the north, was founded in the 7th century BC, and the inhabitants started to use the Grama Bay as a quarry in the 3rd century BC from where they could extract limestone of good quality. The first inscriptions carved into the eastern rock face of the bay were made by the quarry workers themselves. During the following 2,000 years further mariners made their signs on the rock which ended up in the former quarry covered by 1,500 inscriptions. Majority is written in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, but inscriptions in <a href="Messapian%20language">Messapian language</a> as well as ones made by <a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Byzantine Greeks</a> or <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Turks</a> are also included. These typically give the name of the people and that of their vessels. Historical figures also showed up in the Grama Bay and put their marks on the rock, such as <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a> in 48 BC or <a href="John%20V%20Palaiologos">John V Palaiologos</a> in around 1369. The Roman statesman <a href="Sulla">Sulla</a> was actually never visiting the bay, but in 86 BC after defeating <a href="Mithridates%20VI%20of%20Pontus">Mithridates VI of Pontus</a> during the <a href="First%20Mithridatic%20War">First Mithridatic War</a> he ordered to commemorate his triumph with a new inscription made on the Grama Bay’s rocks.

Those arriving to the Grama Bay after the 15th century continued the tradition of making their own <a href="graffiti">graffito</a>, but these pieces are of less archaeological value. Most considerably one can see inscriptions made by the hands of <a href="Himara">Himariote</a> Greeks during the 19th-20th centuries as well as graffito of <a href="Enver%20Hoxha">Enver Hoxha</a>’s soldiers in the second half of the 20th century.

Critical reviews.
Phil Gallo of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" wrote a negative review for season six. Gallo noted that the characters have turned "one-dimensional and single-minded" and that the overall quality has declined, deeming the series a "dull rehash of a casual sex maniac searching for prey, an annoying frustrated single mother and a perky divorcee trying to understand Judaism."

Tom Shales of "<a href="The%20Register-Guard">Eugene Register-Guard</a>" gave the episode "Let There Be Light" a mixed review, calling it a "slapdashy, mishmoshy affair in which some of the humor feels forced, as well as being inconsistent with the witty-wacky tone of the show." Shales was more positive with the next episode "The Ick Factor", which he stated was "full of snap and fizz and one certifiable shock."

Bicycloaromaticity in <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> is an extension of the concept of <a href="homoaromaticity">homoaromaticity</a> with two aromatic ring currents situated in a non-planar molecule and sharing the same electrons. The concept originates with Melvin Goldstein who first reported about it in 1967. It is of some importance in academic research. Using <a href="Molecular%20orbital%20theory">MO theory</a> the bicyclo[3.2.2]nonatrienyl cation was predicted to be destabilised and the corresponding anion predicted to be stabilised by bicycloaromaticity. 

Bicycloaromaticity has been studied by others in relation to the bicyclo[3.2.2]nonatrienyl cation and in relation to specific carbanions . In 2017 experimental evidence was reported for bicycloaromaticity (dual aromaticity) to exist in a <a href="bicyclic">bicyclic</a> <a href="porphyrin">porphyrinoid</a>.

Red Tent (shelter)

The Red Tent was the <a href="tent">tent</a> in which survivors of the <a href="Airship%20Italia">airship "Italy"</a> took shelter after which it fell on the pack of ice polar Arctic at around 10:33hrs of May 25, <a href="1928">1928</a> until the time of their rescue by July 12 "<a href="Krassin%20%281917%20icebreaker%29">Krasin</a>" Soviet ice "break".

History.
The Red Curtain was designed by the <a href="engineer">engineer</a> Felice Trojani, among the emergency equipments for the crew members who were about to get off the aerial view on the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a>; of the equipment was also part of the Ondina 33 radio, through which the Marconist Giuseppe Biagi was able to launch the <a href="SOS">SOS</a> first and then to lead the rescue to the survivors. The tent design was preceded by an accurate study of those used in previous <a href="Polar%20exploration">polar expeditions,</a> and was carried out by Moretti Company in <a href="Milan">Milan</a>.

The Red Curtain was of a central type, with a <a href="Parallelepiped">parallelepipedal</a> base of 2.75 x 2.75 m for 1m high, overlaid with a pyramidal part whose vertex was two and a half feet from the ground. The access was secured through a circular entrance of one meter in diameter and closed by a windshield sleeve. The exterior walls and the bottom were in <a href="Silk">crude silk</a>, not colored, while the inner walls were blue silk; The color was chosen as palliative against the snow ophthalmic.

The tent, designed to accommodate up to four people, hosted nine (including two leg wounds, <a href="Umberto%20Nobile">Umberto Nobile</a> and Natale Cecioni), Titina's mascot, a part of the radio and the batteries that fed it. Once the curtain was recovered between the materials scattered on the pack, it was lifted by Trojani, while Mariano and Viglieri planted the picks in the ice and tensed the winds, loading the edges with recovered food and other weights. At the bottom were placed the cartons containing the sailing cards and the only surviving sleeping bag that, cut and opened, would host the two wounded Cecioni and Nobile, next to the catalytic stove on.

To properly assess the height of the <a href="airship">airship</a> relative to the ground, were not sufficiently reliable altimeters available at the time, and was therefore used a more efficient system: from the cabin of the airship were dropped the vials of glass, stuffed with <a href="Fuchsine">fuchsin</a>, by measuring the time of a fall with a special stopwatch, made in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> by Hausmann, starting from the release until the vial collapsed, packing red.

In order to make the tent visible from above, the survivors decided to use the fallen firecracker vials to draw a line of red lines. Once communications were established through the radio, the rescuers became aware of the new color, and the journalists coined the name ""Red Curtain"". The continual and aggressive light of the Nordic summer made the delicate <a href="aniline">aniline</a> vanish in just a few days, bringing the tent to its original livery.

The Red Curtain was retrieved, along with <a href="Einar%20Lundborg">Einar Lundborg's</a> airplane and all the field materials, from the Krasin crew. Upon returning to <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Umberto%20Nobile">Umberto Nobile</a> donated the Red Curtain to the City of <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, the sponsor of the polar expedition, who dedicated it to the Museum of the <a href="Sforza%20Castle">Castello Sforzesco</a>, today the <a href="Museo%20Nazionale%20Scienza%20e%20Tecnologia%20Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">National Museum of Science and Technology Leonardo da Vinci</a>, where Felice Trojani mounted it for the last time. The Red Curtain was exposed to the public until the mid -nineties, and is now waiting for a long and delicate restoration that once again allows its public exposure.

Shooting of Kian Loyd delos Santos

On the evening of August 16, 2017, 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos was fatally shot by police officers conducting an anti-drug operation in <a href="Caloocan">Caloocan</a>, <a href="Metro%20Manila">Metro Manila</a>. The case became controversial when the official police reports differed from witness accounts and CCTV footage.

Background.
Philippine drug war.
In accordance with his campaign promise, President <a href="Rodrigo%20Duterte">Rodrigo Duterte</a> initiated the controversial <a href="Philippine%20Drug%20War">war on drugs</a> shortly after he took office on June 30, 2016. As of July 26, 2017, the <a href="Presidential%20Communications%20Group%20%28Philippines%29%23Philippine%20Information%20Agency">Philippine Information Agency</a> reported 68,000 anti-drug operations which resulted in around 97,000 arrests, 1.3 million surrenders, and around 3,500 drug personalities killed in legitimate police operations. Thousands of others have been killed by <a href="vigilantes">vigilantes</a>, which the police have categorized as "deaths under investigation". The night of August 14–15, just prior to Delos Santos's death, was the "bloodiest night" in the Philippine drug war, where dozens of police operations resulted in 32 drug suspects killed and more than 100 arrested in <a href="Bulacan%20province">Bulacan province</a>.

Kian Loyd delos Santos.
Kian Loyd D. delos Santos was 17 years old at the time of his death and was a resident of <a href="Barangay">Barangay</a> 160, <a href="Caloocan">Caloocan</a>. Delos Santos was the third of four siblings. His mother, Lorenza, worked as a domestic helper in <a href="Riyadh">Riyadh</a>, <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, while his father, Zaldy, operated a <a href="sari-sari%20store">sari-sari store</a> which was manned by Kian from 5:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. everyday before he went to school. After closing the store at night, he would usually walk around the block for some small talk with neighborhood friends. At the time of his death, he was a senior high school student at Our Lady of Lourdes College in <a href="Valenzuela%2C%20Metro%20Manila">Valenzuela</a>. His high school principal stated that Delos Santos was never summoned to his office for any delinquency or misconduct. According to a classmate and close friend of his, Delos Santos wanted to become a cadet of the <a href="Philippine%20National%20Police%20Academy">Philippine National Police Academy</a>.

Both <a href="Police%20rank%23Philippines">Senior Superintendent</a> Chito Bersaluna, the Police Chief of Caloocan City, and <a href="Police%20rank%23Philippines">Chief Inspector</a> Amor Cerillo, the commander of the local Police Community Precinct, have separately admitted that Delos Santos was not on their police watch list. The officials of Barangay 160, Caloocan also confirmed that Delos Santos was not on their drugs watch list.

Incident.
At around 8:00 p.m <a href="Philippine%20Standard%20Time">PST</a> on August 16, 2017, officers of the <a href="Philippine%20National%20Police">Philippine National Police</a> led by <a href="Police%20rank%23Philippines">PO3</a> Arnel Oares, were conducting a "one-time big-time" anti-illegal drugs operation in Barangay 160, Caloocan City where Delos Santos lived. During the anti-drug operation, Delos Santos went missing for almost an hour, which prompted his family to look for him at the nearest police station but failed to find him there. Several gunshots were then heard.

At 8:57 p.m., Cerillo and another police officer, both in plainclothes, arrived at the <a href="Barangay%20hall">hall</a> of Barangay 160 to report a supposed shootout. In a muddy and dark alley near his house, which was the site of the alleged encounter, Delos Santos was found in fetal position with a gunshot wound to his head. Recovered from his corpse were a <a href=".45%20caliber%20ammunition">.45-caliber</a> pistol, four <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">cartridges</a>, and two sachets of suspected <a href="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a>.

Police report.
According to the official police report, at around 8:45 p.m, Delos Santos tried to flee when he noticed the police officers approaching him. He then drew his gun and "directly shot" towards the police, which prompted PO3 Arnel Oares to fire back in self-defense, killing Delos Santos. The pistol, cartridges, and two sachets of methamphetamine were then found in Delos Santos's possession.

According to Cerillo and Bersaluna, a drug dealer that they earlier arrested claimed that Delos Santos was the <a href="Mule%20%28smuggling%29">mule</a> of "Neneng" Escopino, a local drug dealer on the police watch list.

Witness accounts and CCTV footage.
Witnesses claim that Delos Santos was just loitering near his house at around 8:00 p.m., when two unidentified men grabbed him and led him away. The barangay's <a href="CCTV">CCTV</a> footage of the incident shows that at 8:24 p.m., a young man believed to be Delos Santos was being dragged by two men in plainclothes towards the area where his corpse would be later found. The video also showed a third man that headed towards the same direction.

Cerillo confirmed that the two men in the video were police officers in plainclothes. He also clarified that the person being dragged was not Delos Santos, but rather a police <a href="Asset%20%28intelligence%29">asset</a>. Bersaluna and Cirillo also clarified that police officers are not required to wear their uniforms during anti-illegal drugs operations.

Two witnesses who approached Dominic Almelor of <a href="ABS-CBN%20News">ABS-CBN News</a> claimed that Delos Santos was blindfolded by the two men and forced to hold a gun, fire it, and run. Another witness who approached Saleema Refran of <a href="GMA%20News">GMA News</a> claimed that Delos Santos begged for his life before getting shot. Afterwards, the shooters approached the witness and asked him if he knew the victim, which he denied. The witness later confirmed that the men who were filmed inside the barangay hall reporting the alleged shootout were the same men who shot Delos Santos.

A 13-year-old witness interviewed by "<a href="The%20Manila%20Bulletin">The Manila Bulletin</a>" claimed that she saw Delos Santos being punched and slapped by four armed men in plainclothes before he was dragged away.

Delos Santos's uncle, Randy, questioned the police claim that the victim had a concealed firearm, since his nephew was wearing <a href="Boxer%20shorts">boxers</a> at that time. Delos Santos's father, Zaldy, also pointed out that the pistol was recovered from the left hand of his otherwise right-handed son.

Reactions.
Many Filipino <a href="netizens">netizens</a> expressed outrage over Delos Santos's death. Both the hashtag #JusticeforKian and the phrase "Kian delos Santos" were among the top Philippine trends on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> on August 18. A rally called "Himagsikan para kay Kian" ("Revolution for Kian") will take place on August 21 at the <a href="People%20Power%20Monument">People Power Monument</a> in <a href="Quezon%20City">Quezon City</a>.

Senator <a href="JV%20Ejercito">JV Ejercito</a>, through a series of tweets, described the incident as "very, very disturbing". He recommended that the police officers involved should all be legally prosecuted. Senator <a href="Joel%20Villanueva">Joel Villanueva</a> called it the "breakdown of our humanity, with people cheering the killings of individuals who have not been proven guilty" and added that "we cannot allow lawlessness in this country". In a statement, Senator <a href="Francis%20Escudero">Francis Escudero</a> described the police officers involved as "killers and criminals". While Senator <a href="Sonny%20Angara">Sonny Angara</a> called for the reform of the justice system and decried vigilante justice and killings. In a statement, <a href="National%20Youth%20Commission%20%28Philippines%29">National Youth Commission</a> chairperson <a href="Aiza%20Seguerra">Aiza Seguerra</a> said: "We want to curb the drug menace; however, we are alarmed by the deaths and injury of minors in the process." Senators <a href="Antonio%20Trillanes">Antonio Trillanes</a>, <a href="Risa%20Hontiveros">Risa Hontiveros</a>, <a href="Win%20Gatchalian">Win Gatchalian</a>, and <a href="Loren%20Legarda">Loren Legarda</a> also condemned the shooting of Delos Santos.

NGC 5316 is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> in the constellation <a href="Centaurus%20%28constellation%29">Centaurus</a>. It was discovered by <a href="James%20Dunlop">James Dunlop</a> in 1826. Located approximately 4,000 <a href="light%20year">light year</a>s away from Earth, it is located in the <a href="Carina-Sagittarius%20arm">Carina-Sagittarius arm</a>.

There are 570 probable member stars within the angular radius of the cluster and 262 within the central part of the cluster. The tidal radius of the cluster is 6.0 - 8.1 parsecs (19 - 26 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 5316, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. The brightest member of the cluster (lucida) is star No. 31 (mag. 9.40). Star 31 has significantly more <a href="barium">barium</a> than the rest of the group and the Ba II line is visually stronger than the rest of the cluster. The <a href="Turnoff%20point">turn-off mass</a> of the cluster is estimated to be at 5.0 . The hottest stars of the cluster are of spectral type B5–B7. NGC 5316 has <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> nearly the same as the solar one ([Fe/H] = −0.02 ± 0.05).

The age of the cluster has been estimated to be from as low as 51 myr (by the first <a href="Photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometric study</a> of the cluster, in 1968, by Lindoff) to as high as 195 myr (by Battinelli & Capuzzo-Dolcetta, 1991). Pedreros et al. estimated its age to be (1.24 ± 0.15) × 10 years from ZAMS fitting the cluster (Pedreros, 1987) and the UBVI <a href="Charge-coupled%20device">CCD</a> photometric study of the cluster by Carraro et al. estimated its age to be 100 ± 10 million years.

Inheritance in Indian politics

Indian Politics
The politics in India is a major subject to be discussed at every point of time. They have played an important role in every Indian's life. If a person is elected for any post, every other person living in the country expects some development which can make them feel proud. Every citizen of this country has the biggest responsibility to choose their minister for a particular term.

Hierarchy
The whole concept of politics is being changed in some places. Not all politicians accept this change. But a very few try to inject this Hierarchy into politics which was almost diminished after India became a democratic country. We are in a democracy. If a politician dies, his or her heir comes forward to take the position. People should be aware of the consequences for electing someone this way. Every citizen is responsible for the development of this country.

In 1917 Jännes graduated as a Licentiate of Philosophy and later became a doctorate in the following year. 

Jännes was chairman of <a href="S%20Group">SOK</a> from 1916 to 1917, when he failed to prevent the division of the co-operative movement. 

When the Finnish Federation of Agricultural Producers was founded in 1917, Jännes was elected as the first chairman of the delegation. 

The membership of the Organization was initially small and its influence was based on the expertise of management personnel. Jännes remained a relatively distant person to the members of Agricultural Producers' Union.

After returning to Finland, Jännes founded a gardening and seedling store in the mansion of Ahtiala.

The Pellonraivaus Oy was founded in 1940 on the suggestion of the fence in order to promote the clearing of the new lands. After the war, the membership of the Agricultural Producers' Union expanded considerably and the operation became more brisk. Jännes did not give up on the chair until 1955. He also commissioned Agricultural Producers' Union's research on agriculture, served by the <a href="Nordic%20Council%20of%20Ministers">Nordic Council of Ministers</a> for Agriculture (NBC) and was active in the farming industry.

Abbie C. B. Robinson

Abigail Colburn "Abbie" Ballou Robinson was an editor and political writer.

Early life and family.
Abigail Colburn Ballou was born in <a href="Woonsocket%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Woonsocket, Rhode Island</a>, on September 18, 1828. Her father was George Colburn Ballou (1798-1876), a cousin of Rev. <a href="Hosea%20Ballou">Hosea Ballou</a> and of President <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a>'s mother, Eliza Ballou. Her mother's maiden name was Ruth Eliza Aldrich (1801-1873) 

She had 4 siblings: Celia Ann Ballou Arnold (1825-1906), Oliver Aldrich Ballou (1827-1827), Alpha Bartlett Ballou Brown (1830-1884), and David Ballou (1833-1908).

George C. Ballou, an Universalist, opened a Woonsocket spinning mill in 1829. He later bought control of several mills, and acquired a huge amount of farming lands. He died a millionaire.

She was a woman of ideas quite in advance of her time, brought up, as her ancestors had been, under the Quaker system of repression. The daughter inherited from both parents most desirable qualities of devotion, courage and mental strength. 
She was educated in her native town and in New England boarding-schools. She studied music in Boston and spent three years in Warren Seminary, Rhode Island. She took the regular course in the institute in <a href="Pittsfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Pittsfield, Massachusetts</a>. 
Career.
Abbie C. B. Robinson was as famous for political wisdom as her husband. Of her newspaper career it is somewhat difficult to write, since her public work was so closely interwoven with her private experiences during the very sorrowful and troublous period of her connection with the "Advocate." She went into the office of that paper by the usual route, the desire to help her husband, in the early part of 1882, as Colonel Robinson's health was failing rapidly. Gradually the sick man's duties fell to his devoted wife, and before long she assumed charge of them all, taking the place in the office while she performed her own duties at home, doubly increased by the care of a dying husband. 
After three years of editorial management of the "Advocate", she was placed in a position to assume control of the whole establishment connected with the paper, including not only the business management, but also a job department, a bindery and store. That position she held for four years, during which time Colonel Robinson died. Then came the inevitable result, nervous prostration, an attempt again to take up the work, then her final retirement from the paper in 1888. 
She won for herself an enviable reputation as a woman of much force and ability, always animated by the highest, purest motives, and as an easy, graceful, cultured writer. She was also a good deal of a politician, with original Republican tendencies, though the "Advocate" was a Democratic paper. 
The story of her having brought out a Republican issue of the paper, when it was once put under her charge during Colonel Robinson's editorship, is a standard joke, and is periodically repeated in the State papers. The stand taken by the "Advocate" during the labor strikes and riots in Milwaukee, in 1881, is said to have saved the Democratic party in Wisconsin from making a serious mistake.
Personal life.
On July 12, 1854, Abbie C. Ballou married <a href="Charles%20D.%20Robinson">Charles D. Robinson</a> (1822-1886), of <a href="Green%20Bay%2C%20Wisconsin">Green Bay, Wisconsin</a>. He was the editor of the Green Bay "Advocate" and for many years one of the controlling minds of Wisconsin in all matters of public polity. He was at one time Secretary of State. 
She died in 1893 and is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery, <a href="Woonsocket%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Woonsocket, Rhode Island</a>.

Portico Quartet (album)

"Portico Quartet" is the self-titled third studio album by <a href="Portico%20Quartet">Portico Quartet</a>, released in 2012.

Background.
"Portico Quartet" is <a href="Portico%20Quartet">Portico Quartet</a>’s third studio album. The album saw a notable development in style, incorporating significant use of electronics and looping compared to the acoustic sound of their first two albums <a href="Knee-Deep%20in%20the%20North%20Sea">Knee-Deep in the North Sea</a> and <a href="Isla%20%28Portico%20Quartet%20album%29">Isla</a>.

The group had already been exploring use of electronics, live samples and looping when touring their second album <a href="Isla%20%28Portico%20Quartet%20album%29">Isla</a> in 2010. This was accelerated when founding member <a href="Nick%20Mulvey">Nick Mulvey</a> left in 2011 to pursue a career as a singer-songwriter. Without their main <a href="Hang%20%28instrument%29">hang</a> player, the group turned to sampling the hang, as well as using a hybrid mix of electronic and acoustic drums, and electronically treated and looped bowed bass and saxophone lines.

The drummer, Duncan Bellamy, explained the new approach for the track Laker Boo in a contemporary interview:

"“The twinkly loop that starts it is actually the hang on the loop station but pitched up a couple of octaves and then I pitched the hang down two octaves so the bass notes on that tune are the hang as well. Then Milo is bowing the bass and I was playing the bass drum and the hi hat - then Jack was playing all the samples on the keyboard - because we are now looking for ways to not always have the saxophone, or the sound of the hang, but it's still in there - and that really felt like a breakthrough.”"

The artwork and design for the album was done by the drummer Duncan Bellamy, who has a degree in Fine Art from <a href="Central%20Saint%20Martins">Central Saint Martins</a>.

Critical reception.
"Portico Quartet" received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. In the UK it charted at #98 the week after its release.

Many reviewers heralded the albums mix of electronic and acoustic sounds, and its use of texture. <a href="MusicOMH">Music OMH</a> highlighted how it managed to “amalgamate arrangements of modern and traditional instruments to devastating, hypnotic effect” and <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a> praised the “greatly expanded sonic palette and stylistic purview”. <a href="DIY%20%28magazine%29">DIY Magazine</a> called it “one of the first truly remarkable records of 2012…an album which grabs the zeitgeist but still stays true to its roots: callipygously shuffling, painlessly seguing, mingling the darkest rags ‘n’ bones of dubstep, d ‘n’b and off-kilter jazz, all the while interweaving heck loads of new-found textures and electronics. It’s a forward-thinking game-change which feels rich, warm and – quite simply – astounding”.

Other reviewers highlighted the albums production. <a href="Crack%20Magazine">Crack Magazine</a> said that “Portico Quartet's subtle musical intricacies combined with production values heralding unrivalled clarity have been meshed in a very modern way to create an album of wonderful proportions and balanced minimalism. Stunning.”

The inclusion of a track with vocals - for the first time ever on a Portico Quartet album - divided opinion, however. <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> called it “the best track…a triumph”, while <a href="MusicOMH">Music OMH</a> thought it was “jarring”.

The album came 3rd in <a href="Crack%20Magazine">Crack Magazine</a>’s top 100 albums of 2012 who commented that it was “a glorious success in changing direction…less focused on the hang-drum that defined previous releases, the minimal sparse approach and killer production quality left an indelible mark on our listening.”

Karl Giese

Karl Giese (1898 - March 1938) was a German archivist, museum curator and life partner of <a href="Magnus%20Hirschfeld">Magnus Hirschfeld</a>. 

Biography.
Early years.
He was the youngest of six children of a working-class family and had three brothers and two sisters. His family lived in Schulstraße 17, not far from today's subway station <a href="Leopoldplatz">Leopoldplatz</a>. 

<a href="Institut%20f%C3%BCr%20Sexualwissenschaft">Institut für Sexualwissenschaft</a>.
When he was a student he met <a href="Magnus%20Hirschfeld">Magnus Hirschfeld</a> after a lecture in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> around 1918-1920. Later, Giese became an employee in <a href="Institut%20f%C3%BCr%20Sexualwissenschaft">Institut für Sexualwissenschaft</a> and finally a lover of Hirschfeld. He took over the management of the archive of <a href="Institut%20f%C3%BCr%20Sexualwissenschaft">Institut für Sexualwissenschaft</a>. Hirschfeld described their relationship as a "physical-mental connection". Giese also gave lectures, curated exhibitions and wrote articles.

During this time, Giese met the British archaeologist <a href="Francis%20Turville-Petre">Francis Turville-Petre</a> and the French author and later Nobel Prize laureate <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gide">André Gide</a>. British-American writer <a href="Christopher%20Isherwood">Christopher Isherwood</a>, who lived for some months in the neighboring building, wrote about himself and Karl Giese: 

Ellen Bækgaard, a dentist from <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="World%20League%20for%20Sexual%20Reform">World League for Sexual Reform</a> committee member, describes Giese in her memoirs as "woman of the house". By her, he enjoyed decorating the place and performing a needlework, as well as looking after Hirschfeld wardrobe. 

Karl Giese was interested in theater and acting. He was part of a theater group "Theater der Eigenen". Giese also had a role as the young violinist Paul Körner in <a href="Richard%20Oswald">Richard Oswald</a>'s film <a href="Different%20from%20the%20Others">Different from the Others</a> 

When <a href="Magnus%20Hirschfeld">Magnus Hirschfeld</a> traveled to world tour in 1930, he entrusted to run the affairs of the institute to Giese. 

Exhile in Paris.
Hirschfeld did not return to Germany from his world journey in 1932 and Giese went to meet him in Paris. He found that Hirschfeld had found another partner in 23 year old medical student Li Shiu Tong. Despite some initial jealousy they lived in "<a href="menage%20a%20trois">menage a trois</a>" in Paris.

After <a href="Institut%20f%C3%BCr%20Sexualwissenschaft">Institut für Sexualwissenschaft</a> fall victim to the Nazi Regime and it's archive was burned in Berlin, Giese spent several months in Brno in 1933, trying to purchase copies, that survived. He also made contact with the magazine "Nový Hlas: list pro sexuální reformu" (New Voice: Journal of Sexual Reform), publishing some articles by Hirschfeld and himself.

Later years.
Karl Giese was caught having sex with another man in a public bathing establishment and sentenced to three months' in prison on charges of "arousal of public annoyance" in 1934. As a result of his imprisonment, Giese's residence permit was not extended and he had forcibly required to leave France in October 1934. He went to Vienna and lived there for a year, studying for matriculation exams. Hirschfeld, Bækgaard and <a href="Norman%20Haire">Norman Haire</a> provided him money for life and studying. Hirschfeld and other Giese's benefactors hoped for him to study medicine in London after completing exams in Vienna. 

After the death of Hirschfeld in 1935, he managed to return to Nice for the funeral. Two months before his death, Hirschfeld had named his two lovers, Li Shiu Tong and Karl Giese, as his sole heirs. However, he required not to use their inheritance for personal use, but for the purposes of sexual science. Karl Giese was awarded the library and the objects that had been saved from the <a href="Institut%20f%C3%BCr%20Sexualwissenschaft">Institut für Sexualwissenschaft</a>. Eventually he wasn't able to use his inheritance. <a href="Norman%20Haire">Norman Haire</a> privately provide Giese financial help in hope he will settle in Britain as Hirschfeld's desired, but he moved to <a href="Brno">Brno</a> in 1936 and lived there with Karel Fein for several months, but then moved to his own flat. 

Karl Giese took his life in Brno in March 1938 after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. His hair, the lawyer Karl Fein, was deported and murdered by the Nazi regime in 1942. Since then, Giese possessions and the inheritance of Hirschenfeld have been lost.

Other information.
A memorial plaque was laid in front of his former residence in Berlin-Tiergarten, John-Foster-Dulles-Allee 10 on February 9, 2016.

Living Fields (Portico album)

"Living Fields" is the first studio album by <a href="Portico%20Quartet">Portico</a>, released in 2015.

Background.
Portico were a band formed by three original members of <a href="Portico%20Quartet">Portico Quartet</a>. Despite the similarity in name, they considered this to be a new, separate group due to the difference in musical style.

While <a href="Portico%20Quartet">Portico Quartet</a> are known for their jazz-influenced instrumental music, "Living Fields" is an electronic experimental pop album featuring guest vocal collaborations.

The overall themes for the album, both musically and lyrically, were drawn from the 2010 documentary <a href="Nostalgia%20for%20the%20Light">Nostalgia for the Light</a>. The band identified this as a means of unifying the issues that they were themselves facing in their own lives:

"“The film is about ideas of loss and new beginnings, it's about death and ideas of afterlife, it's about history and time, the beginning of the universe, it's about many many things and deep issues. So it's not about the film necessarily but it's more about the themes and it was a good way to get a thread through the whole album”."

The group’s musical influences were also thematically tied to the overall concept of the album. They described the music as “somewhere between disintegrating ambiance and pop songs” and identified <a href="Tim%20Hecker">Tim Hecker</a>, <a href="William%20Basinski">William Basinski</a>, <a href="Actress%20%28musician%29">Actress</a>, and <a href="Oneohtrix%20Point%20Never">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> as major influences on their sound.

The album features guest collaborations with three singers, all of whom the band had a personal connection with: Joe Newman from <a href="Alt-J">Alt-J</a>, <a href="Jamie%20Woon">Jamie Woon</a>, and Jono McCleery. The band sent the documentary <a href="Nostalgia%20for%20the%20Light">Nostalgia for the Light</a> to them to guide their lyrics:

"“We sent that to each of them and each of them seemed to write about a different aspect of what the film kind of evoked in them. Some had ideas about how we are all bound atomically to the universe in a very scientific but also philosophical way. And then other ones wrote about searching for their lost lovers and family, this idea of loss. Others had ideas about the road that we go down on when we pass away”".

Artwork and design for the album was done by the drummer Duncan Bellamy, who has a degree in Fine Art from <a href="Central%20Saint%20Martins">Central Saint Martins</a>. The front cover image is a sculpture by <a href="Henri%20Gaudier-Brzeska">Henri Gaudier-Brzeska</a>.

Critical reception.
"Living Fields" was generally positively received on its release. It was in <a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo Magazine</a>’s top 10 electronica albums of 2015. 

Several reviewers highlighted the album’s atmosphere and textures. "Line of Best Fit" wrote that with its “Bleeding sounds so that instruments never quite feel entirely synthetic nor material, it's a very British electronic record, with its echoing clatters and restless lack of pattern to tracks…brooding throughout, dark by its production and vocals, and its messages”. <a href="The%20Skinny%20%28magazine%29">The Skinny</a> called it “A moody, elegant record with flickers of shiny, shiny pop…navigates a tricky path between the purely atmospheric and the distinctly rhythmic” and "DMCWorld" praised the “widescreen, cinematic soundscapes that really stretch the music out, wringing maximum tension and emotion from their harmonies…Moody and rather magnificent”.

Other reviewers commented on the records warmth. "Line of Best Fit" wrote that “Living Fields achieves that rare feat of giving electronic music a beating heart, and is without a doubt one of the best records of its class this year” and "Written In Music" wrote that the record is “dynamic and spatial and fragile, sometimes almost unworldly…sounds really warm-blooded”.

Some critics however felt that the album lacked energy and did not stand out sufficiently. <a href="PopMatters">Pop Matters</a> wrote that the album “feels lifeless…These songs are ethereal to a fault, unable to gain a foothold in memory” and <a href="MusicOMH">Music OMH</a> said that “with their synth textures and post-dubstep influences, they don’t sound all that different from much of the pop music being made at the moment”.

History.
The Hamlyn Trust was established in 1948 by the will of Miss Emma Hamlyn in memory of her father, a solicitor and JP in Torquay. The trust was to furtheramong the Common People of this Country of the knowledge of the Comparative Jurisprudence and the Ethnology of the Chief European countries including our own and the circumstances of the growth of such Jurisprudence to the intent that the Common People of our Country may realise the privileges which in law and custom they enjoy in comparison with other European Peoples and realising and appreciating such privileges may recognize the responsibilities and obligations attaching to them.Initially there was doubt as to whether the trust was valid, but the High Court approved a scheme for the administration of the trust in 1948, which followed closely the wording of the will.

<doc id="54959185" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54959185" title="Spiroligomer">
Spiroligomer

Spiroligomers (also known as bis-peptides) are synthetic <a href="oligomer">oligomer</a>s made by coupling pairs of bis-amino acids into a fused ring system. Spiroligomers are rich in stereochemistry and functionality because of the variety of bis-amino acids that are capable of being incorporated during synthesis. Due to the rigidity of the fused ring system, the three-dimensional shape of a spiroligomer – as well as the display of any functional groups – can be predicted, allowing for molecular modeling and dynamics. 

Synthesis.
Spiroligomers are synthesized in a step-wise approach by adding a single bis-amino acid at each stage of the synthesis. This stepwise elongation allows for complete control of the stereochemistry, as any bis-amino acid can be incorporated to allow for elongation; or any mono-amino acid can be added to terminate a chain. This can be accomplished using either solution-phase or solid-phase reactions. The original synthesis of spiroligomers allowed for functionalization on the ends of the oligomers, but it did not allow for the incorporation of functionality on the interior diketopiperazine (DKP) nitrogens. Much work has been done to allow for the functionalization of the entire Spiroligomer, as opposed to just the ends. By exploiting a neighboring group effect, spiroligomers can be synthesized with a variety of functional groups along the length of the molecule.

Structure.
Spiroligomers can be synthesized in any direction, and between any pair of bis-amino acids.
Spiroligomer diketopiperazines can be created between either end of a bis-amino acid.
Spiroligomers are known to be conformationally rigid, due to the fused-ring backbone. 

Chemical Characteristics.
Spiroligomers are peptidomimetics.
Completely Resistant to proteases.
Not likely to raise an immune response.

Uses.
Spiroligomers have been utilized for a variety of applications which include catalysis, protein binding, metal-binding, molecular scaffolds, and charge-transfer studies, et al.

Catalysis.
Two unique types of spiroligomer catalysts (spiroligozymes) have been developed, an esterase mimic and a Claisen catalyst. 

Transesterification.
The first spiroligomer catalyst was an esterase-mimic, which catalyzed the transfer of a trifluoroacetate group. 
Aromatic Claisen Rearrangement.
 The second spiroligomer catalyst accelerated an aromatic Claisen rearrangement with a catalytic dyad similar to that found in Ketosteroid Isomerase.

Protein Binding.
 A spiroligomer was designed to mimic P53 and bind HDM2. The molecule enters cells through passive diffusion, and interestingly, this mimic was shown to stabilize HDM2 in cell culture. 
Metal Binding.

Byzantine conquest of Cilicia

The Byzantine reconquest of Cilicia was a series of conflicts and engagements between the forces of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, the <a href="Hamdanid%20Dynasty">Hamdanid Dynasty</a>, and other Hamdanid rebels over control of <a href="Southeastern%20Anatolia">Southeastern Anatolia</a> and Cyprus. Driven by a need to expel the <a href="arab%20people">Arabs</a> out of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, due to the efficiency and consistency of their raiding, the successive <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> emperors <a href="Romanus%20II">Romanus II</a> () and <a href="Nicephorus%20Phocas">Nicephorus Phocas</a> (), with the help of the general and future emperor <a href="John%20I%20Tzimiskes">John I Tzimiskes</a>, embarked on a series of campaigns to reunite all of Anatolia under the <a href="Greek%20people">Greeks</a>. The Byzantines would also use the opportunity provided by the occupation of the Hamdanids on the mainland to wrest control of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> from the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>; the Byzantines and the Abbasids had shared joint control over Cyprus from 688 AD until then.

Background.
As of the middle of the tenth century, Byzantium was in the midst of a resurgence. In 961 they had <a href="Siege%20of%20Chandax">reclaimed Crete</a> from the Muslims and, following the conquest, were prepared to make expeditions against the Arabs in Anatolia. The <a href="Emir%20of%20Aleppo">Emir of Aleppo</a>, and ruler of the Hamdanid dynasty at the time, was <a href="Sayf%20al-Dawla">Sayf al-Dawla</a> (). A confident and aggressive commander, he executed numerous raids into the Greek heartland, as far as <a href="Iconium">Iconium</a>. After al-Dawla confirmed his rule in <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> in 944, he continued the Arab practice of raiding into Byzantine territory, formally resuming war in 945/46. Despite the frequency and effectiveness of his raids in disrupting Byzantine commerce and generally creating chaos on Byzantium's eastern front, al-Dawla's tactics were defensive in nature, and his armies never posed a serious threat to Byzantine domination of Anatolia; contemporary Arab sources claim (indeed perhaps excaggerate) that Byzantium's armies probably outnumbered al-Dawla's by around 70,000.

Al-Dawla's Emirate was inherently weak. It lacked any kind of naval presence, as al-Dawla sought actively to avoid any kind of pressure to Byzantium's dominance of the Eastern <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. Meanwhile, the "Thughur" system of Hamdanid administration was inefficient and ineffective. Adapted from the Byzantine <a href="Themata">"Themata"</a> system, from which the name derives, combined with the devastating effects of Byzantium's scorched earth tactics on the populace, the "Thugur" system left the Hamdanid provinces in destruction and poverty. Al-Dawla's winter raid (945-6), was of little effect, and fighting between the two powers died down for a few years. 

In 948 and 949 the Byzantines managed two successful invasions of the Hamdanids and sacked <a href="Hadath">Hadath</a> in the first expedition and <a href="Marash">Marash</a> in the second, even raiding as far as <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>. In 950 al-Dawla attempted to raid into Byzantine territory, and was crushed by <a href="Leo%20Phokas%20the%20Younger">Leo Phokas</a>, losing 8,000 men in the "dreadful expedition". Later the same year al-Dawla again attempted to raid Byzantine territory, rejecting their offers of peace, but was soon forced to retire by the coming of winter. The next year <a href="Bardas%20Phokas%20the%20Elder">Bardas Phokas</a> launched a failed expedition into Cilicia in an attempt to prevent the Arabs from repairing some strategic fortresses. Two years later Bardas once again tried and failed to invade al-Dawla's Cilicia. The Hamdanids would hold out against two more Byzantine attacks in 954 and 955.

More serious conflict began in the spring of 956, when al-Dawla began a renewed invasion of Byzantine territory. John Tzimiskes, commanding the Byzantine army, managed to counter by his own invasion of Cilicia, managing to secure a pass in al-Dawla's rear. However, when the two clashed, al-Dawla won decisively, killing 4,000 of Tzimiskes' men. However at the same time, Leo Phokas invaded <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, engaging and defeating al-Dawla's cousin, <a href="Abu%27l-%27Asha%27ir">Abu'l-'Asha'ir</a>. In 957 Nikephorus managed to capture and subsequently raze <a href="Hadath">Hadath</a>, however al-Dawla was unable to respond due to the discovery of a plot against him. From there the tide continued to turn against al-Dawla. In 958, Tzimiskes invaded Arab territory once again, seizing <a href="Dara">Dara</a> and defeating an army of 10,000 men under al-Dawla's lieutenant <a href="Nadja">Nadja</a>. The next year Leo Phokas managed a raid which extended as far as <a href="Cyrrhus">Cyrrhus</a>.

Call for Jihad.
Tensions reached their apex in 960 when al-Dawla declared a <a href="Jihad">"Jihad"</a>. He attempted to marshall and consolidate his forces under the call for a holy war perceiving a weakness in Byzantium's defenses following Nicephorus' departure for <a href="Siege%20of%20Chandax">Crete</a>. Leo soon passed into Muslim territory, avoiding the brunt of al-Dawla's forces and plundering as he went. He waited for the return of the raiding Arab army and soon prepared an ambush for them. Under the Arab general <a href="Ali%20ibn%20Hamdan">Ali ibn Hamdan</a>, the army was caught completely off-guard by Leo. Its forces were quickly slaughtered and Leo recovered loot of both Byzantine and Arab origin, decisively destroying the army. The successive loss of these battles began to have more internal effects for al-Dawla, as well as external ones, as his own government began to lose faith in him. Unfortunately for al-Dawla, Nicephorus now returned victorious from Crete with the majority of the Byzantine army. From 961-962, Nicephorus led his armies into Cilicia, quickly taking <a href="Anazarbus">Anazarbus</a>. Nicephorus retired to Byzantine territory for Easter, 962, and returned in the Autumn in order to drive al-Dawla, who was in Cilicia itself, out of the province. He invaded Arab territory with a 70,000-man strong army, taking <a href="Marash">Marash</a>, <a href="Sisium">Sisium</a>, <a href="Duluk">Duluk</a>, and <a href="Manbij">Manbij</a>. Nicephorus proceeded to ignore al-Dawl's advance forward and brought his army to <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> in mid-December, which he managed to capture and plunder.
al
In 963, war died down between the two powers, as the Byzantine Emperor, <a href="Romanus%20II">Romanus II</a> had recently died, and a brief succession crises was to ensue in which Nicephorus would ascend the throne as <a href="Nicephorus%20II%20Phocas">Nicephorus II Phocas</a> (). On the Hamdanid end, however, things were less peaceful. Al-Dawla faced rebellion after rebellion, first in 961, carried out by <a href="Ibn%20az-Zayyat%20%28governor%20of%20Tarsus%29">Ibn az-Zayyat</a>, then in 963 by <a href="Hibat%20Allah">Hibat Allah</a>, and finally in 963-64 by Nadja. A brief Arab raid was countered by Tzimiskes who was appointed Nicephorus' successor upon his ascension. He soon invaded Cilicia, defeated an Arab army, and tried and failed to siege the important fortress of <a href="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a>.

Final Conquest of Cilicia.
By the time Nicephorus became emperor, after his successful seizure of Crete, he had decided on a grander plan to expand Byzantine territory, rather than merely sack the Arab cities and withdraw. He began his invasion in Autumn 964 and set out with an army of 40,000. He began by spreading out his lighter infantry throughout the Cilician countryside and ordered them to loot and plunder the villages in order to ensure a general atmosphere of confusion and disarray among al-Dawla's administration.Nicephorus then marched the main segment of his forces, the Imperial Army plus the forces of the themes of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, through Arab territory and began to capture major fortresses and cities. He took <a href="Adana">Adana</a>, <a href="Anazarbus">Anazarbus</a>, and around twenty other fortified cities. He then marched on to <a href="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a>. <a href="Tarsus%2C%20Mersin">Tarsus</a> and Mopsuestia were the two largest remain fortresses in the region. Nicephorus quickly realized, after bombarding the city, that only a prolonged siege would manage to force Mopsuestia to capitulate. Soon, with the coming of winter, Nicephorus retreated to his regional capital of <a href="Caesarea">Caesarea</a>, where he passed the season preparing for next year's campaigning season on the sieges of Mopsuestia and Tarsus.

At the spring of 965, Nicephorus once again collected his forces and departed for Cilicia. This time, however, Nicephorus headed strait for Tarsus. There he met the garrison outside of the walls of the city and engaged it. He decisively defeated the army and drove them back into the fortress. He then blockaded the city, raided the surrounding countryside and left for Mopsuestia, leaving the city besieged, blockade, and surrounded by destruction and desolation. He began to in turn siege Mopsuestia, bombarding the city with archers and siege engines. He then employed a similar strategy as used in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Chandax">Siege of Chandax</a> only four years earlier. He instructed his engineers to dig under the city fortifications while the Arabs were distracted and collapse the weakest perceived section of the wall. This worked, and soon the Byzantines began to pour into the city from the destroyed section. The city was then looted and razed, while Nicephorus deported all of its inhabitants. He then returned to Tarsus where the populace, after hearing of the destruction of Mopsuestia, sought terms with the Greeks. They handed over the city to Nicephorus in exchange for the safe passage of migrants seeking to emigrate to Syria, which he granted. With the capture of these two cities, Cilicia once again came under the suzerainty of Byzantium, and Nicephorus returned to Constantinople.

It was around this time that on <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> the Byzantine general <a href="Niketas%20Chalkoutzes">Niketas Chalkoutzes</a> staged a "coup". The nature of the circumstances of this coup are dubious due to a lack of sources, but it is clear that the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid</a> authorities had no preconceived notions of it as it was incredibly successful. The island was returned to the Byzantines and reintegrated into the <a href="Theme%20%28Byzantine%20district%29">Theme System</a>.

Death of al-Dawla and the Siege of Antioch.
Following the quelling of some civil unrest in the spring of 966, Nicephorus once again set out for the east. Nicephorus' strategy was not one of traditional Byzantine origin, but combined the tactics used by the Arabs with his own strategy. He largely avoided open confrontation, pillaging, raiding and capturing cities where he could. He marched east with his army from <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, joining up with his new forces as he passed through Byzantine Cilicia, and advanced onto <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. Nicephorus soon led his army to <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>, where he set up a light siege and began to raid the countryside. 

In the fall of 967, Nicephorus captured many forts in southern Syria, and eventually came to <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripoli</a>. He wished to meet up with his navy there, but the winds and tides were uncooperative and he could not besiege the city, and instead marched north to the fortress of <a href="Arka">Arka</a>, which he soon captured and looted. It was around this time in 967 that al-Dawla died. His successor, <a href="Sa%27d%20al-Dawla">Sa'd al-Dawla</a>, was a weak and ineffectual ruler, and by the time he ascended the throne, Hamdanid territory had become a mere battlefield on which the Byzantines and Fatimids could settle their disputes. Nicephorus did not cease the pillage of Syria until the spring of 969 when he returned to Constantinople. However, he left a large garrison in a citadel of his construction outside of Antioch in order to maintain the siege. Around a year later, Byzantine forces retook Antioch and cemented Byzantine control of the region. 

Aftermath.
Following the loss of Cilicia and Antoich, the Hamdanid state began to deteriorate rapidly. A string of rebellions would fracture and crush the dynasty's power, and the state would barely last to the end of the century before being vassalized and subsequently dissolved by the <a href="Fatimid%20Dynasty">Fatimid Dynasty</a> of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, which would in turn rise to dominate the Levant and the near east for centuries. Byzantium, on the other hand, would continue to expand under the successive emperors Nicephorus, John II Tzimiskes, and <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a>. In fact, the Byzantines would see nearly unchecked expansion for over a century from the conquests of Cilicia and Antioch, only finally being subdued by the <a href="Seljuk%20Empire">Seljuk Empire</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert</a> in 1071.

Isla (Portico Quartet album)

"Isla" is the second studio album by <a href="Portico%20Quartet">Portico Quartet</a>, released in 2009.

Background.
"Isla" is <a href="Portico%20Quartet">Portico Quartet</a>’s second studio album and the follow-up to <a href="Knee-Deep%20in%20the%20North%20Sea">Knee-Deep in the North Sea</a>, their <a href="Mercury%20Prize">Mercury Prize</a>-nominated debut album.

The album saw a continuation and refinement of the live acoustic sound developed in <a href="Knee-Deep%20in%20the%20North%20Sea">Knee-Deep in the North Sea</a>. While those songs were written busking, the songs for "Isla" were written over a period of four winter months in the band’s garden shed. Reflecting this the album has a darker, more introspective tone than its predecessor.

Songs for the album were recorded in May 2009 at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road</a> Studio 2. The album was produced by <a href="John%20Leckie">John Leckie</a>. Electronic overdubs and string arrangements were added at Fish Factory Studios.

Artwork and design for the album was done by the drummer Duncan Bellamy, who has a degree in Fine Art from <a href="Central%20Saint%20Martins">Central Saint Martins</a>. The cover is a painting by Bellamy.

Critical reception.
"Isla" received widespread international acclaim upon its release. 

<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a> highlighted their development in sound and that the album had “exceeded the unreasonable expectations prompted by their impressive debut…it is better focused and better executed…genuinely innovative”.

Other reviewers noted the albums darker tone compared to its predecessor. <a href="Jazzwise">Jazzwise</a> commenting that it was a “highly atmospheric album” with a “haunting sonic texture” and “brooding ambience” that “is much more focused in intent”. The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> described a “deepier, scarier world” and <a href="MusicOMH">Music OMH</a> called it “hypnotic, sultry and mesmorising”.

The album was also acclaimed for its fusing of genres. The <a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a> praised this “quietly impassioned set of originals that fuse elements of pop, jazz, classical and electronics music…wholly original, 21st century experimentalism that stirs both body and soul”. <a href="PopMatters">Pop Matters</a> wrote that “It’s one thing to crisscross musical genres. It’s another to make it sound like second nature” and <a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a> highlighted the albums “glorious eclecticism…Isla feeds on Steve Reich mathematics, Radiohead dread, African desert grooves and ECM northern melancholy”.

Track listing.
All songs composed, arranged and performed by Portico Quartet.
The second printing of the album added “Subo’s Mental Meltdown” as an additional track. This was originally a bonus download track.

EP01 - Abbey Road.
A separate 2009 EP collected together bonus tracks and outtakes from the "Isla" sessions.

Operations.
The trains are formed as three-car sets and used on the <a href="Tokyu%20Ikegami%20Line">Tokyu Ikegami Line</a> and <a href="Tokyu%20Tamagawa%20Line">Tokyu Tamagawa Line</a>.

Formations.

The Boston Free Speech rally took place at the <a href="Boston%20Common">Boston Common</a> on August 19, 2017. The organizers and participants were characterized as adherents of the <a href="alt-lite">alt-lite</a>, a loosely organized right-wing political movement. Around 50 people attended the rally, and they were met by tens of thousands of counter-protesters. The rally was organized by John Medlar and others in the Boston Free Speech Coalition. It was intended to feature <a href="Kyle%20Chapman">Kyle Chapman</a>, Joe Biggs, <a href="Shiva%20Ayyadurai">Shiva Ayyadurai</a>, and Samson Racioppi as speakers, although the rally ended before all of the speeches were made.

Planning.
The rally originally advertised speakers including <a href="Augustus%20Sol%20Invictus">Augustus Sol Invictus</a>, <a href="Gavin%20McInnes">Gavin McInnes</a>, Cassandra Fairbanks, and Joe Biggs. Invictus was asked by rally organizers not to appear "from a PR standpoint," and McInnes and Fairbanks withdrew as speakers.

Rally and counterprotest.
Police erected barricades and blocked streets near the rally, and weapons of any kind were banned. The city planned for around 500 police officers to be present for the event.
The rally ended early, and all rally attendees left the <a href="Parkman%20Bandstand">Parkman Bandstand</a> by 1:00 pm. The planned speeches did not take place. Samson Racioppi, who was scheduled to speak, said "I really think it was supposed to be a good event by the organizers, but it kind of fell apart."

The rally drew only a handful of attendees, while between 30,000 and 40,000 people participated in the counter-protest. The event was largely peaceful, with no injuries reported as of the afternoon of August 19. 33 people were arrested, largely for disorderly conduct. There were a few arrests for assaults on police officers. During a news conference in the afternoon of August 19, Boston Police Commissioner <a href="William%20B.%20Evans">William B.

<doc id="54959884" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54959884" title="Yun Ko-eun">
Yun Ko-eun

Yun Ko-eun (<a href="Hangul">Hangul</a>: 윤고은; born 1980) is a South Korean writer. Yun's first novel "Mujungryeok jeunghugun" (무중력증후군 The Zero G Syndrome) put her on the literary map and is a prime example of her imaginative writing style. In the novel, the moon splits into two, then four, and finally into six moons one day, like a <a href="planarian">planarian</a>. The strange phenomenon plunges people on Earth into chaos, stoking their lunar fantasies, apocalyptic fears, or desire to earn profit from these moons. Yun says she conceived the idea of splitting and multiplying moons when she was at a convenience store purchasing a bun that looked like a full moon. Then she took the idea and expanded it into a novel "like the leavening of bread." Yun often starts a story with an unusual premise and fleshes it out into a rich narrative.

Life.
Yun Ko-eun is her pen name and her real name is Ko Eun-ju. She was born in 1980 in Seoul, South Korea. She studied creative writing at <a href="Dongguk%20University">Dongguk University</a>. She made her literary debut in 2004 when she won the 2nd Daesan Collegiate Literary Prize. Unlike <a href="Kim%20Aeran">Kim Ae-ran</a>, who won the same prize the previous year and immediately came under the spotlight, Yun took a hiatus for several years following her win. In 2008, she reappeared in the literary scene by winning the 13th Hankyoreh Literary Award for her novel "Mujungryeok jeunghugun" (무중력증후군 The Zero G Syndrome). From then to 2017, she published three short story collections—"Irinyong siktak" (1인용 식탁 Table for One), "Aloha" (알로하 Aloha), and "Neulgeun chawa hichihaikeo" (늙은 차와 히치하이커 The Old Car and Hitchhiker)—and the novel "Bamui yeohaengjadeul" (밤의 여행자들 Travelers of the Night). 

Despite having chosen to major in creative writing, she aspired to be a television writer or journalist during her time at Dongguk University. Prior to her literary debut, she ran a blog on which she posted short travelogues or entries about her everyday life. Now she uses the blog (<nowiki>http://blog.naver.com/shellmaker</nowiki>) as a platform to interact with readers.

For several years following her graduation, Yun took on various jobs including tutoring, writing for an in-house periodical, and creating educational material for children, yet she did not write any fiction even though she had already won the Daesan Collegiate Literary Prize. Then at one point she formed a writers club with old friends from Dongguk University. Two years later, she won the 13th Hankyoreh Literary Award with "Mujungryeok jeunghugun". In 2016, she participated in the Overseas Translation Workshop Program held by <a href="Ministry%20of%20Culture%2C%20Sports%20and%20Tourism">MCST</a> and <a href="Literature%20Translation%20Institute%20of%20Korea">LTI Korea</a> at the National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations (INALCO) in France. She has named <a href="Kenji%20Maruyama">Kenji Maruyama</a> and <a href="Martin%20Page">Martin Page</a> as her favorite authors outside of Korea.

Writing.
"Mujungryeok jeunghugun", Yun Ko-eun's first breakthrough novel, begins with the following provocative sentence: "Loneliness is the best Viagra." Literary critic Do Jeong-il and writers <a href="Hwang%20Sok-yong">Hwang Sok-yong</a> and <a href="Kim%20Insuk">Kim Insuk</a>, who judged the Hankyoreh Literary Award and selected "Mujungryeok jeunghugun" as the winning work, writes that it "figuratively and humorously depicts the sense of alienation people feel in today's society. The weight of their alienation is portrayed lightly, and the intensity of their pains cheerfully." The figurative language, humor, and light-heartedness that the judges identified as Yun's strengths can also be found in her later works. A young author, Yun pokes fun at and ridicules social ills or injustices rather than outright condeming or exposing them.   

Literary critic Gang Ji-hui says "Yun Ko-eun seems to have earned a reputation for distorting reality with whimsical imagination." On Yun's narrative structure, Gang notes: "The characters in Yun Ko-eun's novels typically follow a curve that starts from zero, increases in entropy as some imaginative event unfolds, hits peak levels, and falls back down to zero."  

Such characteristics are also evident in Yun's 2016 short story collection "Neulgeun chawa hichihaikeo" (늙은 차와 히치하이커 The Old Car and Hitchhiker). A review summarizes the collection as follows: "Yun Ko-eun's third short story collection "Neulgeun chawa hichihaikeo" consists of eight stories that bring readers to the boundaries between reality and imagination. Some of these stories tip the scales toward the side of imagination: "Y-ray" is about a 'y-ray' machine, a defective product manufactured in an x-ray machine factory, that goes on to diagnose certain individuals as potential dissidents who must be shunned from society; ""Bultaneun jakpum"" (불타는 작품 Burning Works of Art) involves a residency program that invites artists to create artwork over six months, exhibits their completed works once, then burns them up; ""Daokjeong chilbeonji"" (다옥정 7번지 Daokjeong Number 7) presumes that 1930s Korean writer <a href="Park%20Taewon">Park Taewon</a> comes back from the dead in 21st-century Seoul and guides tourists around the places in which his novel is set." (The novel mentioned here refers to Park Taewon's "A Day in the Life of Kubo the Novelist"). Despite their fantastical nature, Yun Ko-eun's stories do not lead readers to a state of actual zero gravity, but to an illusion of it, as the term "Zero G Syndrome" indicates. The illusion is born from the imagination and desires of people whose lives are firmly grounded in reality.

Joy Of Creation series (video game)

""We act, we pose, we play, we stop, we stare, we scream. We bring his visions to life, because that is how we live. Feeding from the joy of creation, and burning what remains.""

After Endless Mode's development was complete and released, Nikson released the Story Mode, which interprets to Scott Cawthon, the developer of Five Nights At Freddy's series story about his life and the animatronics.

First project.
It got canceled after Nikson announced he got tired with the project and has moved on. Though it got turned into The Joy of Creation: Reborn four months after the original TJoC.

Gameplay.
Survival Mode.
The Joy of Creation has only one available mode called Survival Mode. The goal in survival mode is that the player must survive as long as possible without getting jumpscared by the Ignited Animatronics.

You play as Scott Cawthon (the creator of FNAF). There are four Ignited animatronics in the game. You have a flashlight with limited batteries which you need to defend yourself by shining your flashlight at the animatronics.

The animatronics start off at certain locations in your house. e.g. Ignited Freddy starts within the closet in front of you. Ignited Chica starts within the left closet. Ignited Bonnie starts within the hallway to your right. And Ignited Foxy starts off at the balcony behind your back. You have to use your hearing and sight-seeing skills to survive the animatronics for a long amount of time.

Reborn: Endless mode.
The first level should be Ignited Freddy, guarding the first floor.

Ignited Bonnie is the second challenge which he is patrolling the basement.

Ignited Chica's stage, the forest, which the Chica's level is just like any of Slender games, to collect notes.

The bloodthirsty Ignited Foxy's aggressively raging at the attic. This challenge is more different than any of other level, as the developer advised the player to need to take a preventative measures about Foxy, which it is kind like torching at the Foxy's face in good approximation of distance.

Story Mode.
In the Office, Scott was being chased by Freddy after he discovered the animatronics become smarter and angrier.

In the Basement, all the animatronics is Fallen, without exoskeletons, which the voice amplifies louder.

Improvements and appreciation.
In the Reborn Edition, <a href="PewDiePie">PewDiePie</a> caught an interest to this free-roam version game as the <a href="Five%20Nights%20at%20Freddy%27s%203">Five Nights At Freddy's 3</a> and <a href="Five%20Nights%20at%20Freddy%27s%204">Five Nights At Freddy's 4</a> wasn't satisfies him. He rated in his gaming video as his <a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDSNe6syMXKs">favorite horror game</a>.

After a year, a trailer was released showcasing everything that the full Story Mode had to offer, which it is made the player gone metaphysical to the story. This trailer reveals to the spectacular graphics, impeccable voice acting, and an overall impressive story line. The man talking in the trailer gives a bit of an idea about his background and the plot that the player will be taking on in the full game. The lore seems in-depth, it seems as though there will be a lot of story for the player to find within the game itself. It also reveals that the setting will be in a house, as the player suspected.

The animation was a kind of hectic and act more faster, which in the Basement, the fallen endoskeletons chasing the player faster and harsh which its footsteps made the player anxious and scared. The story is much perplexed comparable to any Five Nights at Freddy's story, which it is made into cinematic flashback. Different to Five Nights at Freddy's, the story was made into 8-bit style. Some of the players such as <a href="Markiplier">Markiplier</a> and <a href="Jacksepticeye">Jacksepticeye</a> appreciate the good work from Nikson and his team.

Nikki doesn’t have a relationship with her mother, as Eve abandoned Nikki and her dad 12 years ago.

The scientists conduct a test of the Helios system using an inert mixture, but a valve bursts under the <a href="pressure">pressure</a> which needs to be repaired. Eve tells everyone to delay the launch, but after she has gone home Declan tells them to start up the system using the highly flammable Helios mixture.

Nikki arrives at the airport and gets shown around by the landlords, Henrich and Olivia. Eve arrives at the house but Nikki isn’t happy to see her and goes to her bedroom to spend time by herself. Declan and Killian turn up at the house, explaining to Eve that they have launched Helios, but are getting strange readings and need Eve’s help.

Eve goes with Declan and Killian, they try to shut the Helios system down but the whole system blows up in a massive <a href="explosion">explosion</a>. The effects devastate the surrounding area both above and below ground. Killian and his colleagues go underground to manually shut down the system, but are unsuccessful. The Hellios has flooded into the coal mines under <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, which could blow at any time. Declan evacuates the building leaving Killian and his colleagues trapped underground, attempting cover up his bad decisions.

Eve heads back home to get Nikki safety, however Henrich and Olivia decide to stay.

Guilliam van Deynum

Guilliam van Deynum or Guilliam van Deynen (<a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, c. 1575 - <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, after 1624) was a Flemish <a href="painter">painter</a>, <a href="illuminator">illuminator</a> and <a href="miniaturist">miniaturist</a>. He was mainly a <a href="portrait">portrait</a> artist. After training in Antwerp he spent in the early 17th century a decade in <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> where he was a successful portrait painter. He returned to Flanders where he worked in Brussels as a portrait painter to the <a href="List%20of%20governors%20of%20the%20Habsburg%20Netherlands">Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands</a> <a href="Albert%20VII%2C%20Archduke%20of%20Austria">Archduke Albert</a> and the <a href="Isabella%20Clara%20Eugenia">Infanta Isabella</a>.
Life.
Guilliam van Deynum was born around 1575 in Antwerp. He is believed to be identical with the Gilliam van Deynen (or van Deynum) who was registered in the Antwerp <a href="Guild%20of%20Saint%20Luke">Guild of Saint Luke</a> in 1596. The name of his teacher is not recorded. He had a brother called Antoni (or Antoon) who was a pupil of <a href="Frans%20Francken%20the%20Elder">Frans Francken the Elder</a> in 1595 and became a master of the Guild in the guild year 1616-1617.
Van Deynum arrived in Genoa in 1602 in the company of two brothers, one of whom was the Antoni mentioned earlier and another of whom the name has not been preserved. He must have achieved success early on as he painted a portrait of the local not long after his arrival. It is known that he was the victim of an assault in 1606 and that in 1607 he was imprisoned for non-payment in a case concerning his activity as an art dealer. The (<a href="Palazzo%20Bianco">Palazzo Bianco</a>, Genoa) dated 1610 is the latest dated painting attributed to the period of his residence in Genoa. He is believed to have remained in Genoa until 1613.

Between 1613 and 1614 he is documented in Brussels when the Archdukes Albert and Isabella commissioned two miniatures with their weapons and scenes of the 'Circumcision' and the 'Resurrection'. These works were sent on 10 May 1614 to Philip II, Duke of Stettin and Pomerania, who had requested these works in May 1613. On 20 May 1614, 10 days after the miniatures were delivered, van Deynum formally entered the service of the Archdukes and was named an illuminator of the Brussels court. 

After some time van Deynum came into conflict with the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke. As long as he solely worked for the Archdukes he was free from the local Guild requirements. However, once he started to work for private patrons, the Guild protested and the Guild's deacon fined van Deynum. Van Deynum refused to pay and was then sued before the Magistrate's court. The court requested he either join the Guild or cease to work as an artist. He appealed the verdict to the Council of Brabant, which confirmed the court's ruling. He then took his case to the Archdukes who supported him. By letters executed in Ghent on 31 July 1618 they exempted him from the obligation to join the painter's Guild and relieved him of all his obligations towards the Guild. Van Deynum is documented working on private commissions for <a href="Charles%20de%20Ligne%2C%202nd%20Prince%20of%20Arenberg">Charles d'Arenberg</a> and Anne de Croy in Enghien around 1614-1617. He collaborated with Servaes de Coulx and <a href="Jacob%20van%20der%20Laemen">Jacob van der Laemen</a> on the (Enghien, convent of the Capuchins). His contribution to this work was probably limited to the portraits in the background.
The last mention of his work at the court of Brussels is in the year 1624. It is not known when or where he died.

Work.
The known oeuvre of van Deynum is limited to about 10 works. Van Deynum painted portraits and history paintings. Due to confusion with the still life painter <a href="G.%20van%20Deynum">G. van Deynum</a>, some still lifes have erroneously been attributed to the artist. He was an oil on canvas painter as well as a miniature painter and illuminator who worked with gouache on parchment. The work of the artist is still not very well studied and understood. The signed and dated (1610, <a href="Palazzo%20Bianco">Palazzo Bianco</a>, Genoa) plays an important role in identifying his oeuvre.

The "Portrait of a Genovese lady in a black dress" of 1610 shows his work to be strongly linked to the forms of expression of the end of the 16th century and to closely follow the cold and impersonal approach of <a href="Frans%20Pourbus%20the%20Elder">Frans Pourbus the Elder</a>. His style of portrait painting is situated in the so-called international style of painting. At the time van Deynum painted the "Portrait of a Genovese lady in a black dress" in Genoa, the city was in a period of transition, during which, before the arrival of Anthony van Dyck in 1621, he and other Flemish artists introduced a form of delicate and sincere naturalism in the rigid late 16th century schemes. 

Apart from three female portraits and one male portrait given to the artist, the best known works of the artist are a miniature representing (private collection) and a painting depicting (private collection).
The portrait of doge Agostino Doria and his family of 1604 was likely painted for the private use of the doge as Genoese law did not allow the doges to commission public pictures of themselves to show off their achievements. The painting shows in the foreground the doge, his wife and their four children sitting on a large terrace next to a classicizing building, and offering in the back a view over the Ligurian coastline. Behind three columns in the back, six other figures appear to be peering in at the doge's family. They include on the left the doge's nephew and the painter van Deynum himself and on the right two bearded guards with halberds. There is also a bearded black African man dressed in a green outfit with white collar and lace trimming. The face appears to be the likeness of a particular individual. It is not clear what the role of this figure is. He is likely not a guard nor a page. It is not clear whether he is linked to the character dressed in a gaudy red outfit with a large ruffed collar and moronic grin next to him. They could be court entertainers, but the expression of the African man seems to be too serious for this.
The painting of the "Archduke of Austria and Isabella of Austria at a reception ball in Genoa" was painted in collaboration with his brother Antoni. The painting consists of two planes: on the foreground is shown a lively gathering of elegantly dressed people in distinctive poses while in the back there is a wide landscape occupying three quarters of the composition. On the mountain in the distance a profile of Genoa is depicted. It is possible that Guilliam was responsible for the portraits, which are very delicately rendered with a lot of detail while the collar and other parts which do not display the same lightness of touch were executed by Antoni.

Syncrossus beauforti

Synocrossus beauforti, the barred loach,chameleon loach or chameleon botia, is a species of freshwater fish from the loach family <a href="Botiidae">Botiidae</a> which is found in mainland south-east Asia.

Description.
"Syncrossus beauforti" resembles "<a href="Syncrossus%20berdmorei">Syncrossus berdmorei</a>" but has has 11-14 <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a> rays as opposed to 9-10 in "S. berdmorei". Tn both species there are rows of small, dark spots running along the length of the body and the head, but in "S. beauforti" these markings are a slightly smaller and it has 9-12 faint vertical bars on its body. As the fish matures bars may fade leaving the longitudinal rows of dark markings. The dorsal fin has a black margin and 3 rows of spots, while the <a href="caudal%20fin">caudal fin</a> has several vertical rows of spots. When excited, these fish are able to produce clicking sounds. They grow to a maximum length of 25cm <a href="standard%20length">standard length</a>.

Distribution.
"Syncrossus beauforti" is found in south-east Asia and the species was originally described from specimens taken in a stream in <a href="Nakhon%20Si%20Thammarat%20Province">Nakhon Si Thammarat Province</a> in southern <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> and was then recorded in <a href="Trang%20Province">Trang Province</a> and has now been found to occur in the basin of the <a href="Salween%20River">Salween River</a> on the borders between Thailand and <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> and the <a href="Chao%20Phraya%20River">Chao Phraya River</a> system in western and central Thailand. Records from the Mekong are now attributed to two separate species, "<a href="Syncrossus%20yunnanensis">S, yunnanensis</a>" and "<a href="Syncrossus%20formosanus">S. formosanus</a>" which may be synonyms of "<a href="Syncrossus%20lucasbahi">Syncrossus lucasbahi</a>".

Habitat and Ecology.
"Syncrossus beauforti" occurs in the demersal zone of small and medium-sized rivers and it is habitually associated with streams which clear and fast flowing with a stony or rocky substrate, with large amounts of wood debris and leaf litter. It may enter flooded forest during the high-water periods during the monsoon and returns to the rivers during November and December. It digs burrows in sand or excavates them under rocks. It is omnivorous with the bulk of its diet being made up of insect larvae and benthic animals. Species in the genus "<a href="Syncrossus">Syncrossus</a>" are sociable and are known to form dominance hierarchies within social groups and to undertake ritualised behaviours to determine their place in the hierarchy. These fish possess sharp sub-ocular spines which they can move, these are normally hidden inside a pouch of skin but when the fish is stressed it can erect these spines. In addition they make sounds when excited but the purpose of the sounds is unknown.

Human Use and Conservation.
"Syncrossus beauforti" is sometimes recorded in fish markets being sold for human consumption. It is an aquarium fish but it has not been known to have been bred in captivity so all of the individuals traded are assumed to have been caught in the wild. The taking of specimens for this trade appears to be the principal threat to this species.
It is also threatened by pollution and by the damming of the rivers it occurs in which may prevent the fish from migrating to its spawning areas during the periods of flooding, as well as increasing sedimentation and causing habitat degradation. The population is thought to be decreasing but the population size and extent of the decline is unknown.

Wareru Dhammathat

The Wareru Dhammathat (, ; also known as Wagaru Dhammathat or Code of Wareru) is one of the oldest extant "<a href="dhammathat">dhammathat</a>"s (<a href="legal%20treatise">legal treatise</a>s) of <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> (Burma). It was compiled in the 1290s in <a href="Mon%20language">Mon</a> at the behest of King <a href="Wareru">Wareru</a> of <a href="Hanthawaddy%20Kingdom">Martaban</a>. Modeled after the Hindu legal treatise "<a href="Manusmriti">Manusmriti</a>", the Code expounds mostly <a href="Pagan%20Kingdom">Pagan era</a> Burmese customary law; it contains less than 5% of the content of the "Manusmriti".

The Code was the basic law of the Mon-speaking kingdom until the mid-16th century when it was adopted by the conquering <a href="First%20Toungoo%20Empire">First Toungoo Empire</a>. Translated into Burmese, Pali and Siamese, it became the basic law of the empire. The Code was adapted into the later "dhammathats" of the successor states of the empire. In Siam, the Code coexisted alongside other Siamese legal codes, and became the core portion of the Siamese Legal Code of 1805. In Burma, the Code was revised "to support Burmese customary law with explicitly Buddhist scriptural justifications" by 1640.

History.
Compilation.
The "<a href="dhammathat">dhammathat</a>" was compiled at the behest of King <a href="Wareru">Wareru</a> (Wagaru) of <a href="Hanthawaddy%20Kingdom">Martaban</a>, 1290/91. Wareru, who had proclaimed king of what used to be the Martaban province of the <a href="Pagan%20Kingdom">Pagan Empire</a> only since 1287, set out to compile a customary law book in <a href="Mon%20language">Mon</a>, the main language of his nascent kingdom. He appointed a royal commission, which returned with the legal treatise that came to be known as "Wareru Dhammathat" and "Wagaru Dhammathat" ("Code of Wareru/Wagaru"). The compilation was part of a wider regional pattern in which the former lands of the empire as well as its neighboring states produced legal texts modeled after Pagan's, between 1275 and 1317.

Influences.
The Code is in part based on the 12th century <a href="Pagan%20Kingdom">Pagan period</a> law treatise "<a href="Dhammavisala%20Dhammathat">Dhammavisala Dhammathat</a>". It is mainly Burmese customary law, tempered with Buddhist justifications, and organized in the mold of the ancient Hindu "<a href="Manusmriti">Manusmriti</a>" treatise. Like the "Manusmriti", it is organized in 18 chapters, and justifies the law as given by <a href="Manu%20%28Hinduism%29">Manu</a>, "a sort of Moses-cum-Noah figure who was the first law-giver". But the similarities are superficial. The Code's 18 chapters are not identical to those of the "Manusmriti"; and its Manu is not the first man of Hindu tradition but a "<a href="Rishi">yathei</a>," "who saw the law-book written in large letters on the boundary wall of the world, and recited it to King <a href="Maha%20Sammata">Maha Sammata</a>," the first king of the world in Buddhist mythology.

Most of the Code is Burmese customary law of the Pagan era. The Pagan customary law itself grew out of the first millennium <a href="Irrawaddy%20river">Irrawaddy valley</a> <a href="Pyu%20people">Pyu</a> and <a href="Mon%20people">Mon</a> civilizations. According to Huxley's analysis of the four early Burmese "dhammathats" including the "Wareru", the parts borrowed directly from the "Manusmriti" quantitatively amounted to "between 4% and 5%". Per Huxley, the non-Hindu parts eligible for borrowing amount only to about 10% in any case since "90% of the "Manusmriti" concerns matters of caste, pollution, ritual, penance that are meaningless in a society unconcerned with caste and uninterested in pollution". The borrowed parts hail from the section called "<a href="vyavah%C4%81ra">vyavahāra</a>" while the discarded parts include Hindu rites and sacraments, purifications and penances as well as marriage, animal sacrifice and "ideas of a sacerdotal nature". Nonetheless the Code is not completely free of Hindu influences; for example, it reiterates "to a certain extent" about the "privileges of the higher castes, of <a href="Brahmans">Brahmans</a>" in particular. (These parts would later be viewed as problematic, and be written out in the 17th century.)

Usage.
The Code remained the basic law of the Mon-speaking <a href="Hanthawaddy%20Kingdom">Hanthawaddy Kingdom</a> until the kingdom's fall in 1538/39. It was then adopted by the ascendant <a href="First%20Toungoo%20Empire">First Toungoo Empire</a>. It was translated into Burmese and <a href="Pali%20language">Pali</a> by <a href="Shin%20Buddhaghosa">Shin Buddhaghosa</a>, a monk. The Code was updated in Burmese as "<a href="Dhammathat%20Kyaw">Dhammathat Kyaw</a>". It became the basic law of the empire, which grew to be the largest empire in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> during the reign of King <a href="Bayinnaung">Bayinnaung</a> (r. 1550–1581). The Code's adoption in the Tai states in the empire may not have been a stretch. The states had already been using Pagan-derived legal texts since the 14th century. 

Even after the empire's fall in 1599, the Code lived on—albeit in adapted forms—in the main successor states. In Siam, it coexisted with other legal codes until King <a href="Rama%20I">Rama I</a> compiled a <a href="Three%20Seals%20Law">new legal code</a> in 1805. The new Siamese law's core 18 chapters share "substantial similarities to King Wareru's code", and the new code adds 21 more chapters. In Burma, the Code morphed into a more Buddhist-centric version by 1640. The new treatise often supports Burmese customary law "with explicitly Buddhist scriptural justifications".

Historiography.
The "dhammathat" was first translated into English in 1892 by <a href="Emanuel%20Forchhammer">Emanuel Forchhammer</a> as "King Wagaru's Manu Dhammasattham". He used a Burmese language manuscript dated 23 September 1707. The <a href="British%20rule%20in%20Burma">British colonial period</a> scholars call the "Wareru Dhammathat" "the earliest law-book in Burma still extant". But the 12th century "Dhammavilasa Dhammathat" has been identified as "the oldest extant Burmese law text".

Garðar Cathedral Ruins

Garðar Cathedral () known formally as the "Cathedral of Saint Nicholas" was a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> cathedral church located in <a href="Gar%C3%B0ar%2C%20Greenland">Garðar</a>, situated in <a href="Igaliku">Igaliku</a>, <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>. The cathedral was reduced to ruins and nowadays only itx foundation can be seen. 

History.
The cathedral was founded by Greenland's first bishop Arnaldur in 1126, built of red sandstone quarried from a neighbouring hillside, in a <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a>, the only known church to be built this way in <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>. The cathedral was dedicated to the patron saint of sailors, <a href="Saint%20Nicholas">Saint Nicholas</a>. Changes to the cathedral structure may have taken place during Bishop Jón Árnason's, or Jón Smyrill as he is also known, reign between 1188 and 1209. A bell tower was also built with the cathedral and windows of opaque, greenish glass. The cathedral <a href="chancel">chancel</a> was quite narrow. There were also two chapels, one to the north and one to the south of the church, with the smaller chapel being used as a <a href="sacristy">sacristy</a> which included a path that led to the Bishop's residence. A farm and a palace for the bishop were also built, with the farm big enough to hold around 100 cows. 

The cathedral wealth expanded during the 13th and 14th centuries, with bishops imposing taxes on the locals. Moreover, no one was able to fish or hunt near the lands of the cathedral without the bishop's consent. Revenues were also collected from local hot springs which were believed to have medicinal value. Nonetheless, by the late 14th century, Greenland began its years of decline. With the death of Bishop Álfur in 1378, no new bishop ever went to Greenland even though they were still appointed until the reformation. 

Excavations.
It was only in 1926 that excavations discovered the foundations of the cathedral and the surrounding norse buildings. Excavations were carried out by Danish archeologist Poul Nørlund. On the site, a number of <a href="walrus">walrus</a> skulls and <a href="narwhal">narwhal</a> were discovered, suggesting that the area near the cathedral included a pagan temple. Amongst the most famous excavations include a number of graves, notably a garev of a bishop which was buried in the north chapel of the cathedral. The skeleton discovered was that of a powerfully built middle-aged man. In his hands, a <a href="Crosier">Crosier</a> made of ashwood and decorated with walrus ivory was discovered and a gold ring on the finger. . It is believed that the body belongs to one of Greenland's most famous bishops, Jón Árnason's, or Smyrill who died in 1209. A bell was also excavated which may have been part of the cathedral tower.

Knee-Deep in the North Sea

"Knee-Deep in the North Sea" is <a href="Portico%20Quartet">Portico Quartet</a>’s 2007 debut album. It was nominated for the 2008 <a href="Mercury%20Prize">Mercury Prize</a> and was <a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out Magazine</a>’s Jazz, Folk and World album of the year 2007.

Background.
The songs for the album were developed by the band while busking outside the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> on London’s <a href="South%20Bank">South Bank</a>. The songs are notable for their use of the <a href="Hang%20%28instrument%29">hang</a>, a modern percussion instrument.

The album was originally released in 2007 on the <a href="Vortex%20Jazz%20Club">Vortex</a> imprint of <a href="Babel%20Label">Babel Label</a>. In 2011 the album was re-mixed by <a href="John%20Leckie">John Leckie</a> for <a href="Real%20World%20Records">Real World Records</a> and re-released as a deluxe edition. This included three additional bonus tracks. It was the first time the album was released on vinyl.

The name for the title track comes from when founding member <a href="Nick%20Mulvey">Nick Mulvey</a> attended a rave by the sea in Norfolk.

The album was an important influence on the band <a href="Alt-J">Alt-J</a>, who listed it as one of five records they wouldn’t exist without. The title track was referenced in their song Dissolve Me, from the album <a href="An%20Awesome%20Wave">An Awesome Wave</a>. Joe Newman described it as “the best song of the noughties”.

Music from the album was used as the soundtrack to the <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> play "Curious Under the Stars".

The artwork and design for the album was done by the drummer, Duncan Bellamy, who has a degree in Fine Art from <a href="Central%20Saint%20Martins">Central Saint Martins</a>.

Critical reception.
The album was very well received on its release. It was nominated for the 2008 <a href="Mercury%20Prize">Mercury Prize</a> and was <a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out Magazine</a>’s Jazz, Folk and World album of the year 2007.

The week after the Mercury Prize awards show it debuted on the UK Top 200 Albums Chart at #186.

The album was praised for its sense of melody. <a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a> wrote that it is “mellifluous, exuberant and jaunty, full of catchy tunes and strong hooks” and <a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a> called it “remarkably restrained for a debut record…melodies are carefully thought-out and arranged for the greatest dramatic effect”.

Other reviews highlighted the album’s atmosphere and combination of influences, <a href="MusicOMH">Music OMH</a> highlighted that “where the quartet succeed is in the atmosphere they steadily build up throughout the album, with each track also working on its own as a mini-suite of contrasting moods”. "The 405" called it “an incredibly diverse album…refreshing to hear such beautifully layered, complex sounds created with instruments alone”, and <a href="Contactmusic.com">Contact Music</a> described it as “a finely constructed masterpiece…blending influence of contemporary classical and film composers (Philip Glass and Steve Reich et al) and world musical cultures”.

Shahak Shapira

Shahak Shapira (<a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>: שחק שפירא, born 1 of April <a href="1988">1988</a>) ist an Israeli <a href="Artist">Artist</a>, <a href="Comedian">Comedian</a>, <a href="Author">Author</a> and <a href="Musician">Musician</a> based in Berlin, Germany.

Early life.
Shapira was born in <a href="Petah%20Tikva">Petah Tikva</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and raised in the <a href="Israeli%20settlement">Israeli settlement</a> <a href="Oranit">Oranit</a> located in the <a href="Seam%20Zone">Seam Zone</a>. Shapira's maternal grandfather was the only <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivor of his family. Shapira's paternal grandfather, <a href="Amitzur%20Shapira">Amitzur Shapira</a>, was an <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i <a href="Sprint%20%28running%29">sprinter</a> and a coach for the Israeli track and field team at the <a href="1972%20Summer%20Olympics">1972 Summer Olympics</a> in Munich, Germany. He was murdered by Palestinian terrorists in the <a href="Munich%20massacre">Munich massacre</a>.

In 2002, Shapira immigrated with his mother and younger brother to Germany. The family took residence in the small town <a href="Laucha%20an%20der%20Unstrut">Laucha</a> in the eastern German state of <a href="Saxony-Anhalt">Saxony-Anhalt</a>. With the Neo-Nazi party <a href="National%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">NPD</a> reaching it's statewide highest outcome of 13,55% in 2009's local elections, Shapira describes the town an "eastern German NPD-Stronghold". In 2010, Shapira's younger brother was physically attacked and insulted as a "Jewish pig" by a right-wing extremist.

At New Year's Eve 2014, Shapira was attacked by a group of men after asking them to stop singing anti-Semitic songs in the subway and refusing to delete a video he recorded, showing the Men singing "fuck Jews, fuck Israel" in the middle of the crowded train. The incident was covered by numerous news outlets worldwide with Shapira getting the media's attention after refusing to let his case be exploited by right-wing populists to stir up hatred against Muslims.

Work.
On the basis of New Year's Eve 2014 events, Shapira wrote an autobiographical book about his youth in Israel and Germany, the hostage-taking and murder of his paternal grandfather and the story of his maternal grandfather's survival through the Holocaust. The book has been in Germany's Der Spiegel Bestseller list for two weeks.

In 2015, Shapira launched the "90's Boiler Room" - a parody of the global online music broadcasting platform <a href="Boiler%20Room%20%28music%20project%29">Boiler Room</a> and his first project to gain international attention. Shapira replaced the soundtrack of the live music sessions videos with 90s-era pop hits by <a href="Dr.%20Alban">Dr. Alban</a>, <a href="NSYNC">N*SYNC</a> or the <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a>. The parody videos gained millions of views on YouTube and Facebook.

In early 2017, Shapira launched the controversial online art project "Yolocaust", combining selfies from the <a href="Memorial%20to%20the%20Murdered%20Jews%20of%20Europe">Berlin Holocaust Memorial</a> with footage from Nazi extermination camps. After noticing numerous instances on <a href="social%20media">social media</a> such as <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="Instagram">Instagram</a>, <a href="Tinder">Tinder</a> and <a href="Grindr">Grindr</a> of mostly young people posting smiling <a href="selfie">selfie</a>s with the memorial as a backdrop, or photos of themselves doing <a href="yoga">yoga</a> or otherwise jumping or dancing on the memorial's stone slabs, Shapira decided to ironically point out the jarring disconnect of taking such inappropriately cheerful pictures in so somber a setting. The project gained worldwide attention, a video about the project by the online news channel <a href="AJ%2B">AJ+</a> was viewed 78 million times on Facebook.

In August 2017, Shapira sprayed 30 homophobic, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic and racist tweets outside the <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>'s German headquarters in Hamburg after the social network failed to remove the offensive hate posts on its platform. Explaining his project named "#HeyTwitter" in a YouTube video, Shapira claimed to having reported around 300 tweets to the company within six months, receiving only nine responses from the company, each rejecting the suggestion that the tweets were a violation of the company's terms of service. After the majority of tweets were not removed, Shapira used washable chalk-spray to take the hateful tweets into the real world and confront Twitter, gaining worldwide attention to his project and Twitter's <a href="hate%20speech">hate speech</a> policies.

Gooniyandi

The Gooniyandi, also known as the "Konejandi," are an <a href="indigenous%20Australian">indigenous Australian</a> people of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>.

Language.
<a href="Guniyandi%20language">Gooniyandi</a> with <a href="Bunuba%20language">Bunuba</a> is one of the two languages of the <a href="Bunuban%20languages">Bunuban language family</a>.

Country.
Gooniyandi traditional land stretched over some from <a href="Fitzroy%20Crossing">Fitzroy Crossing</a> in the west to <a href="Margaret%20River%20%28Kimberley%2C%20Western%20Australia%29">Margaret River Stations</a> 150 miles to the east. Their heartland lay north around the limestone enclaves of the <a href="King%20Leopold%20Ranges">King Leopold Ranges</a> and around Stony river. <a href="Norman%20Tindale">Norman Tindale</a> states that their territory encompassed also <a href="Louisa%20Downs%20Station">Bohemia Down</a>, the Ramsay, Sandstone, Mueller, Burramundy, and <a href="Geikie%20Gorge">Geikie Ranges</a>.

According to their tradition, they also had a native purchase on the plains on the northern side of Christmas Creek before the advent of whites, but had lost this area to the <a href="Walmadjari">Walmadjari</a>.

Social organization.
Gooniyandi society is divided into 8 subsections ("gooroo"), each divided into male and female classes.

Ecology and economy.
The Gooniyandi comprised numweouas inland foraging bands, each harvesting the rich resources, of reptiles, crustaceans and fish to be found along their water courses. They had three distinct terms for the types of territory their land covered. Though basically riverine dwellers, shifting around pools, springs and rivers in what they called "walibiri" lands (river country), they also ventured over "pindiri" or plains of scrub-land ("ti:winji") and forested zones ("ke'rede"(trees)) to hunt for kangaroos. A third term was "ka:waro", denoting the mountainous areas where the <a href="Common%20wallaroo">euro</a> could be found. Labour was gendered, with men hunting game, which included bustards, echidnas and emu, while the women gathered vegetables, honey and such protein foodstuffs as <a href="witchetty%20grub">witchetty grub</a>s and frogs.

The Fitzroy Crossing Gooniyandi were ideally placed to be intermediaries in northwest trade, which they called "tjirdi" or "wirnandi". The crossing was a strategic transit point for trading goods that were passed on over vast distances. They would exchange with southern tribes manufactured goods from the northwest and east like "tjimbila", bifaced pressure-flaked stone knives for rites like circumcision and also used for spear blades.

Shellware collected by the <a href="Djaui">Djaui</a> of the <a href="Sunday%20Island%20%28King%20Sound%29">Sunday Islands</a>, and bartered with the Warwa and <a href="Nyigina">Nyigina</a> in exchange for spears, would in turn be traded by these tribes to the Bunuba and Gooniyandi, who called them "tjakuli". These "tjakuli" trade goods were used in exchanges with the <a href="Gija%20people">Gija people</a> and the <a href="Djaru">Djaru</a>. Many such objects from the Djaui would eventually end up among the <a href="Western%20Desert%20cultural%20bloc">Western Desert</a> tribes.

History of contact.
After <a href="Alexander%20Forrest">Alexander Forrest</a> had, in 1879, surveyed Gooniyandi lands, and wrote a glowing account of their potential for development, they began to be selected for pastoral leases in the late 1880s, when pastoralists began to 'open up' the Fitzroy River area to establish cattle and sheep stations.

The Song of Scorpions

The Song of Scorpions is a 2017 Indian <a href="Hindi-language">Hindi-language</a> <a href="drama%20film">drama film</a> written and directed by Anup Singh. Produced by Feather Light Films and KNM, the films stars <a href="Golshifteh%20Farahani">Golshifteh Farahani</a> as a tribal woman learning the ancient art of healing and <a href="Irrfan%20Khan">Irrfan Khan</a> as a camel trader.

"The Song of Scorpions" had its world premiere at the <a href="Locarno%20Festival">70th Locarno Film Festival</a> in Locarno, Switzerland on August 9, 2017.

Plot.
According to an ancient myth, the sting of a scorpion in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan can cause death in less than 24 hours and the only cure is the song sung by a scorpion singer which counters the poison of the scorpion. "The Song of Scorpions" is the story of a tribal woman Nooran (<a href="Golshifteh%20Farahani">Golshifteh Farahani</a>) who takes lessons from her grandmother Zubaida (<a href="Waheeda%20Rehman">Waheeda Rehman</a>) so as to become a scorpion singer like her. After being struck by a tragedy and snubbed by the people of her village, Nooran is offered a marriage proposal by Aadam (<a href="Irrfan%20Khan">Irrfan Khan</a>), a camel trader who has been in love with Nooran ever since he heard her voice. But soon after getting married, Nooran receives another setback which sets her on a path of vengeance to redeem all the misdoings that were inflicted upon her.


Production.
It was reported that the lead actors of the film <a href="Irrfan%20Khan">Irrfan Khan</a> and <a href="Golshifteh%20Farahani">Golshifteh Farahani</a> began shooting for the film in <a href="Jaisalmer">Jaisalmer</a>, <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> in December 2015.

Release.
"The Song of Scorpions" had its world premiere on the Piazza Grande at the <a href="Locarno%20Festival">70th Locarno Film Festival</a> in Locarno, Switzerland on August 9, 2017.

Reception.
Critical response.
Jay Weissberg of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" found the script to be weak and said that, "The beauties of Rajasthan’s desert landscape can’t disguise script flaws in Anup Singh’s disappointing follow-up to Qissa." Boyd van Hoeij of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" praised the cinematography of the film saying that, "The film is absolutely gorgeous to look at, with Swiss cinematographers Pietro Zuercher and Carlotta Holy-Steinemann relishing the opportunity to film a country that looks so unlike their own." but wasn't too impressed with the film saying that, "Generally speaking, the pic suffers from a somewhat fuzzy storytelling style. For example, there is a little bit of background information missing that is only explained in the press book and which helps make sense of some of the particulars of the story." Allan Hunter of "<a href="Screen%20Daily">Screen Daily</a>" praised the cinematography, direction and acting performances in the film saying that, "Although leisurely in places, The Song Of Scorpions retains its grip, especially as we grow more involved in Nooran’s refusal to become a victim and her response to the many challenges placed in her path. The material could easily have lent itself to melodrama or sentimentality but Singh’s understated direction lends it a steely conviction that is further underpinned by some deft casting."

The site began as a religious campground and local cemetery for the area's <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> congregation; a church was added to the site in 1906.

The campground included two springs, which were used as a source of fresh water for the Cherokee and their animals, and a gristmill run by local landowner George Hileman. In addition, several Cherokee children are buried in unmarked graves in the cemetery; the Trail of Tears was deadly for many of those who were forced to travel it, and children were among the most common victims. It is suspected that Hileman allowed the Cherokee to bury their dead in the local cemetery out of sympathy, as his own sons had died recently, though he may have also done so out of a sense of obligation toward fellow Christians.

The site was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on May 8, 2017.

Authaal

Authaal (17 May 1983 – after 1999) was an American-bred <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> racehorse and <a href="Horse%20breeding%23Terminology">sire</a>. He was probably the best horse sired by the ill-fated <a href="Shergar">Shergar</a>, winning at the highest level in both Ireland and Australia. He was unraced as a two-year-old but won four of his five races as a three-year-old in 1986, culminating in an emphatic victory in the <a href="Irish%20St%20Leger">Irish St Leger</a>. After failing to reproduce his best form in 1987 he was set to race in Australia where he recorded major wins in the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Stakes%20%28ATC%29">Queen Elizabeth Stakes</a> and <a href="Underwood%20Stakes">Underwood Stakes</a>. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Japan but had little success as a sire of winners.
Background.
Authaal was a bay stallion with a broad white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">blaze</a> and three white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Leg%20markings">socks</a> bred in Kentucky by the <a href="Robert%20Sangster">Swettenham Stud</a>. He came from the first and only crop of foals sired by <a href="Shergar">Shergar</a> who won the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a>, <a href="Irish%20Derby">Irish Derby</a> and the <a href="King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20Stakes">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes</a> in 1981. Shergar was kidnapped from his owner's <a href="stud%20farm">stud farm</a> in 1983 and never seen again: it is generally believed that he was killed by his captors who were members of the <a href="Provisional%20IRA">Provisional IRA</a>. Authaal's dam Galletto was a successful racemare who won the <a href="Galtres%20Stakes">Galtres Stakes</a> in 1977 and was a daughter of the <a href="Irish%20Oaks">Irish Oaks</a> winner Gaia.

Authaal was the only one of his sire's first crop to be put up for auction as a foal in 1983 and was sold for 325,000 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a>. A year later at the Goffs sale he broke the European record for a <a href="yearling%20%28horse%29">yearling</a> when he was bought for 3.1 million guineas by the bloodstock agent Tote Cherry-Downes on behalf of <a href="Sheikh%20Mohammed">Sheikh Mohammed</a>. The colt was sent into training with David O'Brien.

Racing career.
1986: three-year-old season.
Authaal did not race as a two-year-old and did not appear as a three-year-old in 1986 until July, when he won a <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> over one and a half miles at <a href="Leopardstown%20Racecourse">Leopardstown Racecourse</a>. He followed up despite being dropped in distance in early August when he won a minor race over nine <a href="furlongs">furlongs</a> at <a href="Phoenix%20Park%20Racecourse">Phoenix Park Racecourse</a>. Later that month he was stepped up in class and sent to England for the <a href="Group%20races">Group Two</a> <a href="Great%20Voltigeur%20Stakes">Great Voltigeur Stakes</a> at <a href="York%20Racecourse">York Racecourse</a>. Riden by <a href="Christy%20Roche">Christy Roche</a> he led for most of the way but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished last of the seven runners behind the <a href="Paul%20Cole">Paul Cole</a>-trained Nisnas. He returne to Ireland for a minor race over one and a half miles at <a href="Naas%20Racecourse">Naas Racecourse</a> in September and won by four <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a> from Bank Step.

Christy Roche was again in the saddle when Authaal contested the Irish St Leger over one and three quarter miles at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh</a> on 12 October. The 1985 winner <a href="Leading%20Counsel">Leading Counsel</a> started <a href="Fractional%20odds">6/4</a> joint-favourite alongside the British-trained filly I Want To Be (winner of the <a href="Meld%20Stakes">Meld Stakes</a>), with the French mare Faburola (<a href="Prix%20Kergorlay">Prix Kergorlay</a>) next in the betting and Authaal the 8/1 fourth choice. The other two runners went off at odds of 50/1. With the other six jockeys apparently intent on restraining their mounts, Roche sent Authaal into the lead and opened up a lead of fifteen lengths. Athough his pursuers steadily reduced his margin of superiority in the straight the colt never looked in any danger of defeat and won by five lengths from Faburola.

I the oficial International Clasification for 1986 Authaal was given a rting of 125, making him the top-rated three-year-old in Europe over 14 furlongs and beyond. The Independent <a href="Timeform">Timeform</a> organisation gave him a rating of 118?, with the "?" indicating that the rating was based on "inadequate or unsatisfactory data". In their annual "Racehorses of 1986" Timeform explained that they could not be sure of the extent to which the wide margin of Authaal's win in the Irish St Leger was the result of Roche's bold tactics.

1987: four-year-old season.
On his first appearance as a four-year-old Authaal finished unplaced over ten furlongs and was then sent to <a href="Royal%20Ascot">Royal Ascot</a> to contest the <a href="Ascot%20Gold%20Cup">Ascot Gold Cup</a> over two and a half miles on 18 June. He went off at odds of 9/1 and finished tailed-off last of the eight runners behid <a href="Paean%20%28horse%29">Paean</a>.

1988: five-year-old season.
In 1988 Authaal was sentt to race in Autralia where he was trained by <a href="Colin%20Hayes">Colin Hayes</a>. He finished third to Ostensible in the <a href="Neville%20Sellwood%20Stakes">Neville Sellwood Stakes</a> in March and then contested the Grade I Queen Elizabeth Stakes over 1800 metres at <a href="Randwick%20Racecourse">Randwick Racecourse</a> on 4 April. Ridden by Darren Beadman he started at odds of 3.25/1 and won from Ostensible.

After the winter break, Authaal returned in the Underwood Stakes at <a href="Caulfield%20Racecourse">Caulfield Racecourse</a> in which he was partnered by <a href="Brent%20Thomson">Brent Thomson</a>. He won his second Australian Grade I as he came home three lengths clear of Fair Sir. In October he finished fourth to Sky Chase in the Caulfield Stakes and third under top weight in the Caulfield Cup.

Stud career.
In 1989, Authaal was retired from racing and sent to Japan to become a breeding stallion. He spent ten seasons at stud in Japan but attracted little interest from breeders after 1995 and covered his last mares in 1999. The best of his offpring was the Grade III winner Ibuki Rajo Mon.

Plaça de Sant Felip Neri

Plaça de Sant Felip Neri is a small square in the <a href="Gothic%20Quarter%2C%20Barcelona">Gothic Quarter</a> in the district of <a href="Ciutat%20Vella">Ciutat Vella</a> in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, Spain. The square takes its name from the <a href="Church%20of%20Saint%20Philip%20Neri%20%28Barcelona%29">Church of Saint Philip Neri</a> which presides over the square. To the right of the church is the School of Saint Felip Neri which uses the square as a playground. To the left of the church is a house used by the <a href="Oratory%20of%20Saint%20Philip%20Neri">Oratory of Saint Philip Neri</a>. In the centre of the square is an octagonial fountain, dedicated as a symbol of life. The architecture of the square and surrounding buildings is in the medieval <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a>-style.

History.
The square was once home to the Palace of Neri built in 1752. In the mid-twenth century, Gothic buildings from other areas of the city were moved stone by stone to the square, instead of demolishing them to make room for urban developments. When the hotel Neri was built it was faced in similar gothic stone to maintain the gothic style of the square. In 1938 during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20war">Spanish Civil war</a>, <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> laid seige on the city of Barcelona. On the 30 September 1938, one of Franco's bombs fell on the church killing 30 people most of whom were children from the School of Sant Philip Neri and some were refugee children from <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> where the church had been turned into a make-shift orphange. As people pulled survivors from the rubble, a second bomb hit the square, killing 12 more bringing the death toll to 42. It was the second worst bombing hit in Barcelona during the war. Evidence of the bombings can be seen in the pockmarked walls of the church. <a href="Museu%20del%20Cal%C3%A7at">Museu del Calçat</a>, a footwear museum in the square was closed in 2015 and building remains unused.

Myths.
A myth spread by the <a href="Francoist%20Spain">Francoist</a> authorities stated that the pockmarks in the stone were from the bullets of an <a href="anarchism">anarchist</a> execution of church priests. This was spread in an attempt to cover up evidence of the 1938 bombings.

Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation Between Marne and Moselle, c. 800–c. 1100

Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation Between Marne and Moselle, c. 800–c. 1100 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013) () is a scholarly book by Charles West (1979-). It is based on his Ph.D. thesis, '<a href="http%3A//hooke.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/bib_seek.cgi%3Fcat%3Dman%26amp%3Bbib%3D29685">Upper Lotharingia and Champagne c.850 to c.1100</a>' (University of Cambridge, Faculty of History, 2007).

Summary.
The book's key purpose, discussed in the introduction, is to advance discussion of the origins of <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a>. Whereas <a href="Georges%20Duby">Georges Duby</a> and his successors had argued from the 1950s that the 'feudal revolution' began in France around the year 1000, in the 1990s <a href="Dominique%20Barth%C3%A9lemy">Dominique Barthélemy</a> had led an argument that many these changes happened around 900, but only became obvious in the surviving source-material later, while others are more closely associated with the <a href="twelfth-century%20renaissance">twelfth century</a>. West argues that scholarship had reached an impasse, needing new perspectives drawing on earlier evidence. His chosen case study was the area between the rivers <a href="Marne%20%28river%29">Marne</a> and <a href="Moselle">Moselle</a>, corresponding to <a href="Champagne%20%28province%29">Champagne</a> and <a href="Upper%20Lotharingia">Upper Lotharingia</a>.

The key argument of the book, and its 'biggest departure from the Feudal Revolution model' is that the ninth-century <a href="Carolingians">Carolingians</a>, faced with a world in which property rights were not clearly defined, and in which the meanings of rituals were fluid and open to interpretation, spurred a drive to define and formalise social relations, now known loosely as the '<a href="Carolingian%20Renaissance">Carolingian reforms</a>'. West argues that while many aspects of Carolingian political life did not survive the collapse of the <a href="Carolingian%20Empire">Carolingian Empire</a> in the 880s, this urge to formalise did. He finds that the driver of feudalisation was not primarily the relationship between <a href="fiefs">fiefs</a> and <a href="vassals">vassals</a>, but the formalisation of power as property rights (particularly ownership of land), which could then be exchanged. 'The ruling family's monopoly on rule was eventually lost, but in the end that was a mere matter of dynastic accident. It seems more important that had the Carolingian project continued, it would have ended in a world dominated by power so formalised and well-defined that it could in some circumstances even be thought of as property, which is more or less exactly what happened' (p. 263).

The book is arranged chronologically in three parts.

Part I, 'The Parameters of Carolingian Society', is structured as a <a href="Thesis%2C%20antithesis%2C%20synthesis">thesis, antithesis, and synthesis</a>. Chapter 1 shows that the Carolingians' efforts to formalise and integrate institutions of government─not least kingship─did have significant consequences. Chapter 2, however, shows the validity of counter-arguments that, despite this, formal ideas of offices and property 'dissolve on inspection' (p. 76), revealing a politics that was more unstable, contested and provisional. Chapter 3 balances these arguments by arguing that while Carolingians did not create a <a href="Public%20administration">public state</a>, their cultural reforms did have a profound effect on elites' ways of thinking: 'the impasse ... between top-down approaches and those centred on the local practice of power, which has shadowed the debate on the Feudal Revolution, can be dismantled. We need to think of symbolic practices reaching throughout society, with eminently practical consequences' (p. 104). This chapter has been seen as 'the keystone of the entire book'.

Part II, 'The Long Tenth Century, c. 880–c. 1030', examines a period where evidence is particularly hard to interpret, once more offering contrastive chapters, exploring the period from a top-down and then a bottom-up perspective. West uses the clearer evidence of sections 1 and 3 to establish a framework, and tries provisionally to interpret the disparate evidence about the tenth century through this framework: the section serves 'as a bridge between Carolingian symbolic fragility and feudal formalization'. Chapter 4 argues that the weaker kingship evident in the post-Carolingian period may have been a consequence of the Carolingians' own project of formalising and stabilising the power of the aristocracy, and so a symptom of wider social change rather than a cause of it. Chapter 5, correspondingly, argues that the tenth century saw a process of 'symbolic impoverishment', whereby the social meanings of rituals and practices became less fluid and more fixed. Thus, rather than being defined through <a href="Comes">relationships with the royal court</a>, the position of <a href="count">count</a> came to be legally stable on its own terms, independently of the ruling dynasty.

Part III, 'The Exercise of Authority through Property Rights, c. 1030–c. 1130' argues that the emergence of feudalism was a knock-on effect of ninth-century Carolingian reforms. Chapter 6 focuses on the emergence of so-called '<a href="bannal%20lordship">bannal lordship</a>' and argues that the eleventh century saw the emergence of a more tightly defined concept of land ownership familiar today but not before. Whereas before aristocrats might pass on their "office" to their successors, in the twelfth century they could pass on the ownership of land: a '<a href="Precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitation</a> of rights' into a form of '<a href="Reification%20%28Marxism%29">petrified social power</a>'. Whereas the exercise of power had once been quite improvisatory, 'in the late eleventh century, lords everywhere were busily working out whether they had the right' extract rents and dues (p. 196). Chapter 7 is the book's closest engagement with <a href="Susan%20Reynolds">Susan Reynolds's</a> seminal "Fiefs and Vassals", and argues amongst other things that the ecclesiastical <a href="Investiture%20Dispute">Investiture Dispute</a> is evidence for a more general enthusiasm for defining and constituting more precisely social roles, statuses, laws and rituals. Finally, chapter 8 compares and contrasts Champagne and Upper Lotharingia, considering how different political conditions in these parts of the former Carolingian Empire cast light on West's thesis. 'Judicial rights emerged from the undifferentiated authority of the ninth century everywhere; it was merely the means by which they did so that differed. East of the Meuse, the process took place in a more ordered way, managed by the kings and co-ordinated by the exploitation of intact ecclesiastical estates; in the wesy, with less co-ordination provided either by ecclesiastical estates or the royal court, there was greater fragmentation' (p. 254).

It consisted of eight companies of Maltese soldiers, and it saw action in the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>.

British troops first arrived in Malta in 1798 in order to aid the Maltese in their rebellion against the <a href="French%20occupation%20of%20Malta">French</a>. On 10 December 1799, the <a href="30th%20%28Cambridgeshire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">30th</a> and <a href="89th%20%28Princess%20Victoria%27s%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">89th Regiments of Foot</a> arrived from Sicily in order to enforce the <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%281798%E2%80%931800%29">blockade of Valletta</a>, which was being held by the French. By February 1800, the commander of the British forces in Malta Brigadier-General <a href="Thomas%20Graham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lynedoch">Thomas Graham</a> informed his superiors that he was intending to raise a Maltese force to fight in the blockade. 

The first two companies of the Maltese Light Infantry were set up on 2 April 1800, and by May the unit had eight companies of 100 men each. It was temporarily commanded by Captain James Weir of the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a>, before being transferred to Brigadier-General Moncrieff on 9 June 1800. Sergeants from the 30th and 89th Regiments became subaltern officers in the Maltese Light Infantry. Soldiers in the battalion were paid 8<a href="%C2%A3sd">d</a> a day, and their uniforms consisted of blue-grey coats which had red facings and gold lace, along with nankeen trousers.

The battalion fought in the blockade alongside both <a href="National%20Congress%20Battalions">Maltese irregular forces</a> and British regular troops, until the French surrendered in September 1800. By the beginning of 1801, the battalion had 747 men garrisoned at <a href="Fort%20Manoel">Fort Manoel</a> and <a href="Fort%20Ricasoli">Fort Ricasoli</a>, with a detachment at <a href="Fort%20St.%20Angelo">Fort St. Angelo</a>. Although the battalion was intended for local service, 300 volunteers were sent to <a href="Elba">Elba</a> on 22 September 1801 on board <a href="HMS%20Athenienne%20%281800%29">HMS "Athenienne"</a>. They arrived on 11 October, relieving the besieged British garrison during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Porto%20Ferrajo">Siege of Porto Ferrajo</a>.

The detachment in Elba returned to Malta in April 1802, and the battalion was disbanded upon the expiration of the two year period for which its men had enlisted. Many of the soldiers re-enlisted in the newly formed <a href="Maltese%20Provincial%20Battalions">Maltese Provincial Battalions</a>.

The regimental colours of the Maltese Light Infantry were presented to Major Weir. In 1884, his son returned them to Malta and Governor <a href="Arthur%20Borton%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Arthur Borton</a> presented them to the <a href="Royal%20Malta%20Fencible%20Artillery">Royal Malta Fencible Artillery</a>. They were then deposited in the <a href="Palace%20Armoury">Palace Armoury</a> in Valletta.

National Association of Latino Arts and Culture

The National Association of Latino Arts and Culture (NALAC) is a Texas based non-profit dedicated to the advancement of Latino arts and culture. It’s currently the United States leading arts organization dedicated exclusively towards the promotion of Latino art and artists in the United States and Latin America. 

History.
NALAC was founded in 1989 when a group of prominent Latino artists from various artistic disciplines and walks of life got together in order to change the fact that despite there being many talented artists within the Latino community there is not a single organization dedicated to advocating on their behalf and providing seed money through grants to help them succeed and be more representative within the artistic world. During the first few years the NALAC reached out to Latino artists and provided them with a network of support but they found themselves struggling and without clear direction. 

All this changed when the NALAC board of directors appointed Maria De Leon as executive director. Maria was a woman who has earned a reputation as "nation’s Fifty Most Powerful and Influential People in the Nonprofit Arts” and served on the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20the%20Arts">National Council of the Arts</a> under former president <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barrack Obama</a>. Maria being a long time volunteer with NALAC Maria saw first hand the creative talent of many of the Latino artists NALAC worked with she also realized that many of the artists had great ideas but lacked the funds to cultivate those ideas into reality. Maria utilized her network within the art world to raise money and create NALAC first grant program, NALAC Fund for the Arts. The Fund for the Arts allowed individuals project to be brought to life but it was not sustainable for it only provided funding for single projects and most artists had trouble marketing themselves or their work. Recognizing that this is a common problem with in the artistic and creative community NALAC began to collaborate with people from the business side of the art world in order to create the Leadership Institute. 

Today NALAC is the nations leading Latino art organization and only art organization supporting over 900 artists and art based organizations annually. Since its founding in 1989 NALAC has provided over 2.3 million dollars in grant money in support of over 185,000 Latino artists and art based organizations throughout the United States and <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. 

Leadership Institute.
Created in the early 90s The Leadership Institute Is a culturally rooted program that looks to develop leaders by selecting promising Latino artists and not only providing the environment and resources where an artist can cultivate their artistic skills and swap ideas and collaborate with other artists. But recognizing that for an artist to be successful they need to network and learn the business and administrative side of the art world as well. The Leadership institute has facilitated by such teachers as Dr. Maribel Alvarez and Abel Lopez and helped develop the career of such artists as Lia Uribe.

Transnational Cultural Remittances Grant Program.
Created in 2008 and supported by the <a href="National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Arts">National Endowment for the Arts</a>, <a href="Ford%20Foundation">The Ford Foundation</a>, and <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon%20Foundation">The Andrew Mellon Foundation</a> a way for both individuals and community groups to utilize art as a means of cultural exchange between the United States, Mexico and Central America. 

Visiones.
Produced by Galan productions and Nalac Visiones is a six part documentary series that brings to you on a trip across the United States to show off the creative talent of Latino artists from all walks of life. The documentary was presented on <a href="PBS">PBS</a> and went on to win the <a href="Imagen%20Awards">Imagen award</a>. The series along with its accompanying education curriculum is an education tool created to expose student to Latino arts and culture it has been distributed to more than 35,000 schools.

<doc id="54960861" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54960861" title="One Touch Make Ready">
One Touch Make Ready

One Touch Make Ready (also known as One Touch, and often abbreviated as OTMR) refers to the various <a href="statutes">statutes</a> and <a href="local%20ordinances">local ordinances</a> passed by various <a href="Local%20government%20in%20the%20United%20States">Local Governments</a> and utilities in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, which require the owners of <a href="Utility%20pole">utility poles</a> to allow a single construction crew to make changes to multiple utility wires. While specific portions of the statutes vary, all carry a unifying theme that under these laws, certified construction crews chosen either by the pole owners or local governments are allowed to make all the necessary changes to a utility pole to make it ready for a new attachment.

Effect.
Under the current system which is in effect across most of the United States, before a provider can attach a new wire to a <a href="utility%20pole">utility pole</a>, the existing pole attachments must be rearranged so that the pole can be made ready for a new attachment. Often times, there are multiple attachments on the pole already (e.g., telecommunications, cable etc), and, under the current system in the United States, each is moved sequentially — which can create delays and multiple disruptions in high traffic areas, such as alongside a major roadway. This is known as 'make ready work.' Across the United States, utility poles may be owned by the local government, a municipal electric company, a private entity, or any combination of the three. In most cases, the poles are owned by a private entity, like a local incumbent phone company or electric company. The make ready work can take months for every new attaching entity since numerous steps must be completed by every party with a wire on the utility pole in question before a new entity can attach its wires. Most notably that each party with a wire must individually arrange to send a contractor and truck to the pole. This process involves multiple companies each sending a truck on a different day to the same pole to move wires until appropriate space is made for the requested attachment. The more wires attached to the pole, the longer (and more expensive) the make ready process becomes. 

In a location which has adopted one touch make-ready, companies that own utility poles agree on one or more common contractors that could move existing attachments on a pole (‘make ready’ work), allowing a single crew to move all attachments on a pole on a single visit, rather than sending in a unique crew to move each attachment sequentially. Supporters of the measure argue this will significantly reduce the time, disruption, and cost to local communities caused by installing new lines.

Differences between localities.
Nashville.
<a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville's</a> OTMR ordinance is unique in that it includes a clause which requires a company wishing to install a new line (henceforth referred to as Company A) to, after having reached an agreement with the pole's owner, must give every company already on the pole 30 days notice to move their equipment. If those companies do not comply after 30 days, then Company A can perform the complex make-ready work. If there are any errors or problems from Company A's make-ready work, then the companies already on the pole can recoup expenses from Company A.

Implementation in various areas.
As of August 2017, only three cities in the United States have One Touch Make Ready statutes: <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, and <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>. Numerous other cities are in various stages along the process of implementing the One Touch Make Ready system.

Louisville, Kentucky.
On February 11, 2016, the <a href="Louisville%20Metro%20Council">City Council</a> of <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a> voted 23-0 to adopt a One Touch Make-Ready Statute, making it the first city in the country to adopt such legislation. According to city councilman Bill Hollander, who sponsored the legislation "This will help businesses locate here and grow here. It will create jobs, and will retain and attract our young people and make Louisville broadband ready." These sentiments were echoed by Louisville Mayor <a href="Greg%20Fischer">Greg Fischer</a>, who stated that it would help lay the groundwork for entities like <a href="Google%20Fiber">Google Fiber</a>, and said "Tonight's vote puts Louisville one step closer toward becoming a Google Fiber city." The legislation states that an applicant for attachment must first receive approval from the existing pole owners, at which point it may contract a pre-approved construction crew to perform all make ready work at its own expense. Pole owners and pre-existing providers whose wires were moved may choose to do post-make ready work inspections and call for remedial work if needed, at the new provider’s expense.

San Antonio, Texas.
On May 6, 2016, <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio</a>'s <a href="Municipal%20utility%20district">municipal utility</a>, <a href="CPS%20Energy">CPS Energy</a>, adopted broad new guidelines which included many of the fundamental principles of One Touch Make Ready legislation. The standards include specific requirements for OTMR, and include what needs to happen before, during and after the process. The 128-page standards are far more detailed than the legislation passed by <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a> a few months prior. This is mainly due to CPS being an electric company. The Introduction of the standards states: 

The standards go on to lay out technical provisions, administrative procedures, as well as various specific provisions for both wired and wireless utility pole attachments. They incorporate recommendations from the FCC on how best to expand broadband while also addressing safety concerns by working into the guidelines various safety standards recommended by the <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA).

Nashville, Tennessee.
On August 2, 2016, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Council%20of%20Nashville%20and%20Davidson%20County">Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County</a> began to debate its own One Touch Make Ready Ordinance. The measure, sponsored by Councilman Anthony Davis, was nearly identical to the measure passed by the city of Louisville several months prior. On September 6, 2016, the Nashville City Council Approved the Measure 32-7 on a roll-call vote, as the Council's computer systems were down. On September 20, 2016, Councilwoman Tanaka Vercher, a critic of the bill, proposed a resolution that would delay voting on the bill for two Council meetings. This resolution was defeated 26-12. A few hours later, the City Council passed the OTMR bill via voice vote. After the vote, Nashville Mayor <a href="Megan%20Barry">Megan Barry</a>, stated she would sign the bill.

On September 21, 2016, the Mayor of <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, Megan Barry, signed into law the city's OTMR ordinance. The ordinance exists under Nashville Law as Ordinance BL2016-343 Notably, throughout the entire process of the debate amongst council lawmakers on the specifics of the bill, Barry remained neutral on the bill's contents, refusing to comment on the bill's status, and only encouraging lawmakers and providers to seek a compromise.

Arguments.
In favor.
Reduced cost, time, and disruption.
Supporters, such as the Fiber to the Home Council (FTTHC) and the <a href="NCTA%20%28association%29">National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA)</a>, argue that OTMR policies drastically reduce the cost of adding additional lines, noting that allowing a single crew to work on a line over the course of a single workday, as opposed to multiple crews working on multiple, often non-sequential days, reduces the financial cost of adding additional lines, by decreasing the number of workers needed to install a new line, thereby decreasing the total number of man-hours worked. Further, the FTTHC argues that OTMR policies reduce the traffic disruption caused by the large <a href="Aerial%20work%20platform">Aerial work platforms</a> used by the overwhelming majority of utility pole maintenance companies in the United States.

Increased Competition.
Supporters, such as <a href="Google%20Fiber">Google Fiber</a> and several lawmakers, have argued that OTMR policies create and encourage competition, as they can theoretically allow any outside <a href="Internet%20service%20provider">Internet service provider</a> to lay networks of <a href="Fiber%20optic%20cables">Fiber optic cables</a>, thus leading to a breakup of the various local internet <a href="Monopoly%23Utilities">monopolies</a> which exist across the United States. 

Opposed.
Numerous groups have come out and criticized OTMR since its implementation in several cities. The <a href="American%20Legislative%20Exchange%20Council">American Legislative Exchange Council</a> (ALEC), along with several lobbying groups, have critiqued the proposal. In addition, the measure has received extremely vocal opposition from cable and telephone providers, mainly AT&T and Comcast, who together have thus far filed lawsuits against every city which has successfully passed OTMR ordinances.

Federal Oversight.
Opponents, including AT&T, Comcast, and the <a href="Nashville%20Electric%20Service">NES</a> have argued that the regulation of telecommunications poles fall under the purview of the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a>. To back this up, they cite Federal Pole attachment rules, which mandate the Federal Communications Commission, not local municipalities, regulate telecommunications poles. However, on October 30, 2016, in response to the case "AT&T v. Louisville Metro", the Federal Communications Commission stated that states which have opted out of the FCC guidelines (including <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>) are not subject to the Federal Pole Attachment rules.

Involvement of Google Fiber.
Opponents, including the <a href="American%20Legislative%20Exchange%20Council">American Legislative Exchange Council</a>, have criticized the policy as a blatant attempt by local officials to "bend over backward" to ensure the continued support of <a href="Google%20Fiber">Google Fiber</a>'s expansion within their respective cities. ALEC further contends that cities are willing to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to defend legislation in court that they see as only a way to appease <a href="Google">Google</a>. They cite Google's willingness to join as defendants in every OTMR lawsuit filed as of August, 2017.

Rights of Corporations.
Opponents such as the <a href="American%20Legislative%20Exchange%20Council">American Legislative Exchange Council</a> have argued that OTMR ordinances violate the property rights of corporations to control what happens on their respective lines. They further claim that OTMR ordinances violate federal property law by allegedly allowing any third party to relocate equipment on a pole, without notifying the equipment’s owners, unless the third party believes there will be a service outage. It is important to note, however, that so far, all cities which have successfully passed OTMR ordinances have included provisions which mandate that only contractors approved by the pole's owners may work on the lines.

Legal Challenges.
AT&T vs. Louisville Metro Government.
On February 25, 2016, <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a> (which owns an estimated 25-40% of <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>'s utility poles) filed a lawsuit in federal court against the <a href="Government%20of%20Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Lousiville Metro Government</a>. In the lawsuit, officially titled "BellSouth Telecommunications LLC vs. Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government", AT&T argued that the city's One Touch Make Ready ordinance violated state and federal law. In the 11-page filing, AT&T asked a federal judge to clarify that the power to regulate pole attachments lies solely with the <a href="Kentucky%20Public%20Service%20Commission">Kentucky Public Service Commission</a>, as well as with the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a>. In response to the lawsuit, Louisville Mayor <a href="Greg%20Fischer">Greg Fischer</a> stated: "We will vigorously defend the lawsuit filed today by AT&T, as Gigabit fiber is too important to our city's future." AT&T responded by stating that the ordinance allowed third parties to seize its property temporarily. In a statement, an AT&T spokesman said: "Unless the court declares the ordinance invalid and permanently enjoins Louisville Metro from enforcing it, AT&T will suffer irreparable harm that cannot be addressed by recovery of damages."

On February 26, 2016, in an official blog post titled "Standing With Louisville," Chris Levendos, <a href="Google%20Fiber">Google Fiber</a>'s Director of National Deployment and Operations stood by the city, stating: "Google Fiber stands with the city of Louisville and the other cities across the country that are taking steps to bring faster, better broadband to their residents." 

On June 29, 2016, Attorneys for <a href="Frontier%20Communications">Frontier Communications</a> filed a briefing in federal court asking to join AT&T as plaintiffs in the case. In their briefing, Frontier argued that, even though they do not serve the state of Kentucky, the ordinance's "unprecedented scope" could set a precedent that could harm Frontier's business in the future. Frontier also noted that they were not paid by AT&T to assist in the suit, nor were they asked about it.

On October 6, 2016, Attorneys for Google Fiber filed a court briefing that, if approved, would allow the company to assist in defending against the suit. In their filing, they claim the ordinance is: “a valid exercise of Louisville Metro’s unquestioned authority to manage construction activities in public rights-of-way.” Further, the attorneys argued that the ordinance would “enhance public safety while reducing disturbance and congestion.”

On October 31, 2016, in response to the lawsuit, the Federal Communications Commission released a statement, which guaranteed that the city's OTMR ordinance does not conflict with federal law. In the filing, the FCC stated that “[AT&T] maintains in its motion for summary judgment that the Louisville Ordinance conflicts with, and is therefore preempted by, the federal pole-attachment rules promulgated by the Commission under Section 224. That argument is wrong as a matter of law.”

On August 16, 2017, US District Court Judge David Hayes rejected AT&T's arguments and threw out the lawsuit. "A one-touch make-ready approach inherently regulates public rights-of-way because it reduces the number of encumbrances or burdens placed on public rights-of-way," Hale wrote. "The one-touch make-ready ordinance requires that all necessary make-ready work be performed by a single crew, lessening the impact of make-ready work on public rights-of-way." Hale also ruled that FCC guidelines do not apply in Kentucky, as the state exempted itself from those laws.

Nashville Electric Service vs. Nashville Metro Government.
On October 21, 2016, the <a href="Nashville%20Electric%20Service">Nashville Electric Service</a> (abbreviated NES), which is one of the twelve largest public electric utilities in the United States, filed a lawsuit against the Metro Government of <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>. At the time, NES owned 80 percent of the utility poles in Nashville. After filing the lawsuit, a spokesman for the company said the OTMR ordinance forces the company to choose between complying with the new law or its existing contracts with <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a>, <a href="Comcast">Comcast</a>, as well as other internet providers. According to the court filing, the declaratory judgment is meant to clarify NES's rights and obligations. The company also stated that it had received a letter from AT&T, threatening to sue them if they complied with the law. In response to the lawsuit being filed, Nashville Mayor <a href="Megan%20Barry">Megan Barry</a> stated: “We believe in One Touch Make Ready and look forward to defending its legality. Our focus is simply on providing services to our citizens, who have expressed their desire for those services through their elected representatives." 

On February 3, 2017, NES announced that it had reached an out-of-court settlement with Google Fiber, as well as the city of Nashville, over the OTMR policy. In the agreement, "Google Fiber [has] promised NES it would pay any potential damages that result from NES abiding by the ordinance in relation to the deployment of Google Fiber,” NES President and CEO Decosta Jenkins said in a statement issued Friday. She further clarified “This is a win for NES, Google Fiber, Nashville and residents who are looking forward to having access to Google Fiber.” As part of this settlement, NES dropped its pending lawsuits against Google and the city of Nashville.

Personal choice is one reason given to explain the different numbers of men and women performing tasks that provide high pay or status.
Other reasons include social pressure, inherent biological or psychological differences, and <a href="sexism">sexism</a>. 

Columnist Suzanne Fields, commenting on the recent <a href="Google%20Memo">Google Memo</a> case - where an employee was fired for suggesting that sexism might not be the only reason for the disparity between the sexes at Google - wrote:


Sarah Jane Glynn, Associate Director for Women’s Economic Policy at the <a href="Center%20for%20American%20Progress">Center for American Progress</a>, wrote:

Personal choice is not the only factor, and historically social pressure against girls or women taking on "men's work" or departing from traditional female roles is widely believed to be responsible for female predominance in nursing, teaching elementary school, and so on. There are very few male "<a href="supermodel">supermodel</a>s". Jobs that require greater manual dexterity or attention (like seamstress) may also attract women, while jobs requiring greater physical strength (like <a href="lumberjack">lumberjack</a> or <a href="stevedore">stevedore</a>) tend to be filled by women. It is a matter of controversy whether there are any jobs - at least in America - where inherent psychological differences would tend to disqualify women, although research into the matter continues.

Yip Kue Sum

Yip Kue Sum (1884 - 1967) was a Chinese-born New Zealand pioneer in <a href="viticulture">viticulture</a>.

Yip Kue Sum was born in China in 1884. She married <a href="Joe%20Ah%20Chan">Joe Ah Chan</a>, who emigrated to New Zealand in around 1905, but remained in China while he established himself in New Zealand. Kue Sum went to a private tutor in her village to study English, as at the time immigrants were required to pass a literacy test of 100 English words in order to enter New Zealand. She was able to pass the test and moved to New Zealand in 1920. 

Her husband had opened a general store at <a href="Matamata">Matamata</a> in the North Island, and Kue Sum ran the store together with him. Two years later, the couple moved to <a href="Thames%2C%20New%20Zealand">Thames</a> and opened a fruit shop and market garden, and in 1924 they leased land for a vineyard and opened Goldleaf Vineyard. In 1935 they expanded to a second vineyard under the same name.

As Ah Chan was frequently away from the vineyard for months at a time, Kue Sum was responsible for leading and managing the workers who picked, wrapped and packed the grapes for transportation. She was also responsible for the security of the vineyard, as burglars frequently broke in to steal grapes from the vines. She used an Alsatian watchdog to keep watch, and a broom as her weapon.

Ah Chan was known in the local community for her generosity and hospitality. During the Depression she gave work to some of the many desperate people who came to the vineyard seeking employment, and was also a host to the other Chinese market gardeners in the area.

The couple intended to retire to China and purchased a property in <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a>; however the Communist victory in 1949 changed their plans and in 1950 the couple sold the vineyard and moved to <a href="Blockhouse%20Bay">Blockhouse Bay</a>, Auckland. Kue Sum died in 1967 and was buried beside her husband, who had died in 1959, at <a href="Waikumete%20Cemetery">Waikumete Cemetery</a>. She was survived by her three children.

While at a restaurant, teenage friends Chris Parker (Jonathan Barger) and Marty O'Neil (Josh Turner) realize that a man is taking notes on their conversation. After stealing his notebook, Chris and Marty run into their friend Annie Foster (Charis Conwell), who's father has been mugged. Chris soon gets a phone call from his sister, Sam Parker (Ella Danyluk), explaining that she's trapped in a storage room in their school. Chris and his friends attempt to discover the people behind these events, leading to an unexpected revelation.


Production.
Pre-production began in summer of 2016, with a screenplay co-written by Mick Starego and Will Knight completed in autumn of the same year. Mick Starego was to direct the film as his debut feature. Originally actor Sam Davidson was cast to play the lead role of Chris Parker, Jonathan Barger was chosen instead to star as filming began in October.

"Strangers in the Night" was produced by members of West Potomac Film, a student film group based out of <a href="West%20Potomac%20High%20School">West Potomac High School</a>.

Filming.
Principal photography began on October 21, 2016 in Alexandria, Virginia, and continued until November 19, 2016. However after extensive changes and rewrites to the script, reshoots began on February 16, 2017 and took place until April 19, 2017.

Marketing.
On April 6, 2017 a minute and a half trailer for the film was uploaded to YouTube under the channel WP Studios. The trailer starts with 2 friends having dinner at a restaurant, then after realizing that a man is taking notes on their conversation, clips of increasing action are shown culminating in the friends stealing the notebook. The trailer places a guitar cover of Frank Sinatra's "<a href="Strangers%20in%20the%20Night">Strangers in the Night</a>" over the video, with suspenseful strings rising in the background until the end. The trailer, still on YouTube, advertises a release date of April 19, 2017.

Release.
"Strangers in the Night" was originally slated to premiere on October 31, 2016 at the Kogelman Theater at West Potomac High School, however principal photography did not begin until October 21, 2016, and the release date was pushed back to April 19, 2017. After missing that date, the release date was tentatively set for October 31, 2017, a year after the original expected premiere. 

Attempted Premiere.
Reshoots continued up until April 19, 2017, the film's expected release date. Due to the technical issues with the movie caused by rushed production and post-production, the film's premiere showing was cancelled an hour after the expected showing time. West Potomac Film later released a statement apologizing for the difficulties and issued affected consumers a choice of refund or digital copy of the film once it was available.

Plot.
A baron by birth and former fighter ace, Jérôme exists as a gambler, hanging around casinos and racetracks. At Deauville, he strikes lucky by taking not only a million off a Middle Eastern billionaire at baccarat but also lifting his mistress Perle, a brittle old flame. Going further, in a private game he wins eleven million from a marquis who is trying to sell his motor yacht. Jérôme takes the yacht, worth nine million, with a promise that the remaining two million will be sent to a post office he nominates. The vessel is lying at Rotterdam, so Jérôme heads there with Perle and the two then set course by inland waterways for Monte Carlo, his next field of operations. 

At a lock in Champagne, the fuel runs out and Jérôme has no ready money left. They have no food either, so eventually Perle walks in desperation all the way to a smart restaurant, where she is picked up by Maurice, heir to a famous winemaking firm. Jérôme accepts that in the circumstances she is entitled to change partners, so she and her cases disappear in Maurice's car. At an isolated little inn near the lock, Jérôme has been telephoning repeatedly to get his two million and has caught the eye of the owner, a sweet widow called Maria. She gives him credit, cooks him meals and her gentle charm makes him think of a peaceful rural life. Until the day his two million comes through to the village post office when, after filling up with fuel, he points his craft south for the Mediterranean and fresh adventures.

Brazilian coastal defense ship Marshal Deodoro

Marshal Deodoro was a <a href="coastal-defense%20ship">coastal-defense ship</a> built for the Brazilian Navy at the end of the nineteenth century. It was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Marshal%20Deodoro-class%20coastal%20defense%20ship">its class</a>, alongside . "Deodoro"s crew was one of several ships to rebel in the 1910 <a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Lash">Revolt of the Lash</a>, and the ship was used for <a href="Neutral%20country">neutrality</a> patrols during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. It was sold to Mexico in 1924, and <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up for scrap</a> in 1938.

Service.
"Deodoro" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> by the French shipbuilding company "<a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nouvelle%20des%20Forges%20et%20Chantiers%20de%20la%20M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e">Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée</a>" in 1896, supervised by Admiral José Cândido Guillobel. Its construction was temporarily suspended by the Brazilians while they modified its design. It was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 18 June 1898, after a ceremony that was attended by individuals from Brazil, the French Navy, and a Russian gunboat. Its <a href="ship%20christening">christening</a> was accomplished with an electric button, which sent a signal to cut a cord and let a bottle of champagne break on the ship. At the beginning of the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> (1898), officials from both participants traveled to France to inspect the incomplete "Deodoro" and sister ship "Floriano" in view of purchasing them for the conflict. Neither was close enough to completion to make such an acquisition worthwhile.

"Deodoro" was completed in 1900, and its trials were successful, including a 24-hour trial that featured a mean speed of . After the ship was handed over to Brazil, the ship left France "en route" for Brazil, stopping along the way in the Spanish <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>. A nearby British warship, which was at that time engaged in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, suspected the ship of being a <a href="Boer">Boer</a>-chartered <a href="privateer">privateer</a> heading south to interfere with British merchant ships plying along the coast of southern Africa. Although the Brazilians were able to convince the British of their identity, they steamed with lights off for the next one to two nights in an effort to avoid further confusion with any other warships.

"Deodoro" saw its first action as part of the <a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Lash">Revolt of the Lash</a> in 1910. The Brazilian Navy at the time was heavily segregated between white officers and a broadly black or"mulatto" enlisted sailors, and the former would often violently punish the latter for even minor transgressions. Tensions came to a head in November 1910, when sailors aboard the new <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> rebelled, and the crews of "Deodoro", another new dreadnought (), a new cruiser (), and several smaller vessels joined. The revolt ended peacefully, and the mutineers were granted an amnesty that was later reneged upon.

The Brazilian Navy overhauled "Deodoro" in Rio de Janeiro, fitting a new propulsion system and armament, in 1912. During the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, the navy placed "Deodoro" in its northern squadron, where it was used for <a href="Neutral%20country">neutrality</a> patrols off the northeastern part of the country. On 19 April 1924, they sold the ship to the <a href="Mexican%20Navy">Mexican Navy</a>, where it was renamed "Anahuac". No further upgrades were made to the ship in its remaining service life, and the Mexican Navy <a href="ship%20breaking">sold it for scrap</a> in 1938.

Reception.
"<a href="The%20Film%20Daily">The Film Daily</a>" only rated the film as "fair", observing "The situations are generally amusing, but they lack the zip and power which spells concerted comedy and occasional belly-laughs." The magazine faulted the script mostly, saying that Sedgwick's "... direction keeps matters moving as best he can considering that the script and gags are none too strong or original." The felt that Brown's fans would appreciate his performance, as it was what they would expect, particularly pointing out the solid performance of Robinson. "<a href="Motion%20Picture%20Daily">Motion Picture Daily</a>" was kinder to the film, calling it the funniest film Brown had made since "<a href="Elmer%2C%20the%20Great">Elmer, the Great</a>". They felt the picture had "considerable hilarity", and complimented the direction of Sedgwick, as well as the work of the supporting cast. The "<a href="Motion%20Picture%20Herald">Motion Picture Herald</a>" also enjoyed the picture, again calling the film the best in Brown's career since "Elmer, the Great".

Chant après chant

Chant après chant (Song after Song) is a composition for soprano singer, piano, and six percussionists, by the French composer <a href="Jean%20Barraqu%C3%A9">Jean Barraqué</a>, written in 1966. It is the third part of a projected but unfinished cycle of works based on <a href="Hermann%20Broch">Hermann Broch</a>’s novel "<a href="The%20Death%20of%20Virgil">The Death of Virgil</a>", and uses texts written by the composer as well as extracts from the second book of Broch’s novel, in the French translation by Albert Kohn. A performance lasts about twenty-five minutes.

History.
"Chant après chant" was composed rapidly, in just a few weeks, on a commission from <a href="Les%20Percussions%20de%20Strasbourg">Les Percussions de Strasbourg</a>. It was premiered in the <a href="Palais%20des%20F%C3%AAtes">Palais des Fêtes</a> at the Strasbourg Festival on 23 June 1966. The performers were Berthe Kal (soprano), André Krust (piano), and Les Percussions de Strasbourg, conducted by <a href="Charles%20Bruck">Charles Bruck</a>. The manuscript score is not dated, but was finished late in April 1966. When the score was published in 1968, it bore a dedication to Madame Edouard Blivet, the daughter of Francine Le Faucheur. However, on 20 August 1970, Barraqué added to the manuscript score a dedication to Maria and <a href="Michel%20Bernstein">Michel Bernstein</a> .

The first commercial recording was made in Copenhagen for Valois Records, from 20–23 December 1969, in the presence of the composer .

Analysis.
The programme note written by Barraqué for the premiere begins:

Acoustical resonance and visual images of light, sparks, and flashing glimpses are Barraqué’s focus here; so are Broch's characteristic paradoxes (e.g., "noch nicht und doch schon"—not yet, and yet already) play a central role here . 

As in the <a href="Concerto%20%28Barraqu%C3%A9%29">Concerto</a>, the composer builds "Chant après chant" in seventeen phases but, in this case, after having completed the main structure, Barraqué added an additional opening section, ending with a <a href="cadenza">cadenza</a> for the piano and a first vocal line. The first phase occupies nearly a quarter of the total duration, and half of the work has elapsed by the time the fifth phase has finished. The second half of the work, therefore, hurries through the remaining twelve phases, sometimes presenting two simultaneously. Barraqué uses a rhythmic series of seventeen <a href="Cell%20%28music%29">cells</a>, and for the pitched structure applies his technique of "proliferating series" to two source <a href="Tone%20row">rows</a>: the basic row for the "Mort de Virgile" cycle, and the row from his <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20%28Barraqu%C3%A9%29">Piano Sonata</a> .
