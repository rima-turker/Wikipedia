Springfield, Clear Lake and Rochester Railway

The Springfield, Clear Lake and Rochester Railway (SCL&R), also known as the "Springfield Suburban", was an Illinois electric <a href="interurban%20railway">interurban railway</a>. In operation by 1909 and abandoned by 1912, it offered service between the Illinois state capital of <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Illinois</a> and the <a href="Sangamon%20County%2C%20Illinois">Sangamon County</a> rural towns of <a href="Clear%20Lake%2C%20Illinois">Clear Lake</a> and <a href="Rochester%2C%20Illinois">Rochester</a>. Its active network was 11 miles (18 km) in length, with a 7-mile-long main line from Springfield to Rochester and a 4-mile-long branch line to what was then the excursion destination of Clear Lake. 

History.
The interurban line was incorporated in 1906. One year after going into operation, it was legally reorganized in 1910 as the "Mississippi Valley Interurban Railway". Two years later it was no longer operating safely, and the <a href="Illinois%20Commerce%20Commission">Illinois Railroad and Warehouse Commission</a> ordered in July 1912 that operations be suspended pending urgently required repairs to one or more <a href="railroad%20bridge">railroad bridge</a>s. The original firm appears to have lacked means to repair the unsafe spans. 

Shortly after the suspension, separate promoter groups filed legal papers to recharter the "Springfield, Clear Lake and Southern Railway Company" (August 1912) and the "Mississippi Valley Traction Railway Company" (September 1912). The Springfield, Clear Lake & Southern promoters told the trade press they planned to work with creditors to acquire operating control of the struggling line by foreclosure, make necessary repairs, and build new trackage to the town of <a href="Riverton%2C%20Illinois">Riverton</a>. However, nothing appears to have come of either charter, and the suspension evolved into abandonment.

Interpretation of Dreams (Antiphon)

The Interpretation of Dreams or Dream-book, written by a certain Antiphon of Athens, is an influential ancient treatise on dreams, of which only a few fragments survive. 

It is not certain whether the Antiphon who wrote the treatise was the same figure as the Antiphon who wrote the <a href="Sophistic%20works%20of%20Antiphon">Sophistic works of Antiphon</a>, who is sometimes identified with <a href="Antiphon%20%28orator%29">Antiphon the Orator</a>. The recent scholarly edition of Pendrick, however, sees it as probable that this treatise was written by the same author as the Sophistic works, as does the edition of Laks and Most. Some earlier scholars, though, including <a href="E.R.%20Dodds">E.R. Dodds</a>, take the view that Antiphon the dream-interpreter was a separate person.

The treatise is notable, in the words of Pendrick, because it "was apparently the first "literary" work written on the subject of dream-interpretation—or at least the first to have achieved wide circulation". <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> refers to it, as do <a href="Diogenes%20of%20Oenoanda">Diogenes of Oenoanda</a> and <a href="Artemidorus">Artemidorus</a>.

Wellington batted first, and Hole opened the bowling for Nelson. He bowled throughout the innings, taking 8 for 37 off 18 overs as Wellington were dismissed for 93. Nelson went in and made 100. Wellington batted again and were 40 for 5 at stumps on the first day.

Ball and shot gun

The ball and shot gun, often also known by the marketing name paradox gun, is a shotgun capable of firing both <a href="Shot%20%28pellet%29">shot</a> and <a href="Bullet">solid projectiles</a>. First built by <a href="Holland%20and%20Holland">Holland and Holland</a>, the term paradox is a proprietary name applied to these guns by Holland and Holland.

Design.
Ball and shot guns resemble side by side <a href="double-barrelled%20shotgun">double-barrelled shotgun</a>s, typically with pistol grips and flip up sights. The ball and shot gun has broad, shallow rifling in the chokes of smoothbore shotgun barrels.

Ball and shot retained the ability to fire shotgun shells, whilst being able to fire useful bullets accurately at short ranges, in a gun of manageable weight. A typical 12 bore ball and shot gun weighed , whilst a fully rifled 12 bore rifle would weigh over more than . Ball and shot guns were available in a variety of calibres, from <a href="8%20bore">8 bore</a> to <a href="28%20bore">28 bore</a>.

The original 12 bore loading from Holland and Holland fired a pure lead bullet that was accurate to ranges up to , <a href="Westley%20Richards">Westley Richards</a> developed a 12 bore loading that fired a LT-capped bullet at slightly over which was accurate to ranges up to .

Westley Richards 20 bore ball and shot guns fired bullets accuratly to , whilst their 28 bore ball and shot guns fired bullets at at ranges of .

History.
The ball and shot gun was invented by <a href="George%20Fosbery">COL George Fosbery, VC</a>, who in 1885 took out the English patent (patent number 7565) for a system of very shallow rifling in the chokes of smoothbore shotgun barrels. Fosbery immediately offered the patent to Holland and Holland, who bought it and from 1886 until 1899, when the patent expired, had exclusive rights to build this class of firearm, marketing it as the Paradox gun.

After the expiry of the patent, most of Britain's larger firearm makers offered similar firearms, some retaining the name paradox gun, others opting for new names such as the Jungle gun, Colindian or Cosmos, although the most famous of these was the Westley Richards' Explora (for 12 bore and above) and Faucita (for 20 bore and 28 bore).

Use.
The 8 bore and 10 bore guns were considered suitable for dangerous game, whilst the most common <a href="12%20bore">12 bore</a> was suitable for medium game.

In his "Thirty-seven years of big game shooting in Cooch Behar, the Duars, and Assam" <a href="Nripendra%20Narayan">Nripendra Narayan</a>, the Maharajah of Cooch Behar, states the 12 bore Paradox "is an excellent weapon for <a href="Tiger">Tiger</a>, <a href="Bear">Bear</a> or <a href="Leopard">Leopard</a> at short ranges up to 100 yards."

In his "African Rifles and Cartridges", <a href="John%20%26quot%3BPondoro%26quot%3B%20Taylor">John "Pondoro" Taylor</a> wrote that the 8 bore and particularly the 10 bore ball and shot guns were popular as stand by backups to smaller calibre rifles for <a href="lion">lion</a> shooting. He states he used a paradox gun chiefly for shooting leopard, loading one barrel with a 750 gr solid lead bullet and the second with of buckshot.

In his "Wild Beasts and Their Ways", <a href="Sir%20Samuel%20Baker">Sir Samuel Baker</a> described the 12 bore paradox gun as "a most useful weapon ... wonderfully accurate within a range of 100 yards" and that "the penetration and shock are most formidable".

Great War service.
In the early stages of the First World War, Holland and Holland paradox guns were pressed into service to combat the threat from <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>s. Holland and Holland developed a special 12 bore incendiary round, known as the "Holland Buckingham .707 inch Incendiary shell", designed to ignite the airship's hydrogen cells. At least 12 paradox guns were purchased by the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> for use by UK based patrol aircraft and they remained in use until suitable <a href=".303%20British">.303 British</a> incendiary ammunition was developed.

<doc id="54963397" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54963397" title="Citizens' Defense">
Citizens' Defense

The Einwohnerwehr, or "Citizens' Defense," was a far-right paramilitary in <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Germany</a> that existed in violation of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> from mid-1920 until June 29, 1921. It was established with the goal of defending Germany against Communist uprisings and foreign attacks, though it was also hostile to the <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a>. It was based in Bavaria, where anti-Berlin and anti-republican sentiment attracted such activity. On June 29, 1921, the German government gave in to Allied demands and dissolved the Citizens' Defense. Its militants moved on to fight in other far-right paramilitaries with similar goals.

Historical Context and Formation.
The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Kingdom of Bavaria</a>, a monarchy, had been abolished after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Bavaria then <a href="People%27s%20State%20of%20Bavaria">briefly became</a> a socialist republic, <a href="Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic">and then, by revolt,</a> an unrecognized revolutionary socialist state. On May 3, 1919, this state was overthrown with the help of the far-right <a href="Freikorps">Freikorps</a> militia. After that, a moderate, Social Democratic Bavarian state government was nominally restored. But Bavarian nationalism flourished as many of its politicians, Army officers, and commoners desired a restoration of the monarchy in defiance of Berlin. And in March, 1920, the monarchist <a href="Gustav%20Ritter%20von%20Kahr">Gustav von Kahr</a> became Bavaria's Minster-President and gave far-right groups room to operate. It was in this atmosphere, as the summer of 1920 played out, that former Army officer and <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> member <a href="Ernst%20R%C3%B6hm">Ernst Röhm</a>, along with others, established the "Einwohnerwehr", or "Citizens' Defense." This paramilitary, illegal under the Treaty of Versailles, was comprised partially of reorganized "Freikorps" units, which had not disbanded after the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918-19">German Revolution of 1918-19</a>. At 200,000 strong and centered in Bavaria, the Citizens' Defense was involved throughout Germany in anti-Communist and (more quietly) anti-republican activities, though many of its leaders actually saw it primarily as providing defense for Germany's frontiers.

On the European Stage.
Though the Citizens' Defense was involved in internal struggle, it soon became entangled in foreign conflict. In March of 1921, the Allies, citing the Treaty of Versailles, demanded the dissolution of the illegal paramilitary and occupied two German cities along the Rhine. But Germany did not disband it. That same month, German Communists attempted a short-lived revolt. And in May, Germany sent the Citizens' Defense to help crush a <a href="Silesian%20Uprisings">Polish uprising</a> in the important coal province of <a href="Upper%20Silesia">Upper Silesia</a>. (The fighting had been brought about by the controversy over the results of the <a href="Upper%20Silesia%20plebiscite">plebiscite that had been held there</a> to determine whether Upper Silesia would be controlled by Germany or Poland.)

Dissolution.
All these conflicts may have given the Berlin government justification for the Citizens' Defense. But Germany was hoping to negotiate a more lenient peace deal with the Allies and did not believe resistance to France and Britain would be successful anyway. The German government was replaced in May. The new government was determined to cooperate with the Allies, in the hopes that this would help them achieve a better peace. So on June 29, 1921, Germany officially dissolved the Citizens' Defense, and the Bavarian government, beginning to fear the goals of the paramilitary, allowed it, though Gustav von Kahr soon resigned as Bavarian Minister-President. Disbanded Citizens' Defense militants went on to join other far-right paramilitaries, like the <a href="Bund%20Bayern%20und%20Reich">Bund Bayern und Reich</a> ("League for Bavaria and Empire"), the chief successor organization of the Citizens' Defense.

Biography.
Early life and education.
Francis Joseph Hogan was born to Maurice Hogan and Mary E. (McSweeney) Hogan in Brooklyn, New York, on January 12, 1877. His father died when he was five years old, leaving his mother to support three children on a <a href="seamstress">seamstress</a>'s wages. In the 1880s, the family moved to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, where they lived with Mary's sister. Hogan grew up in a household run by two widowed women, along with his cousin <a href="James%20F.%20Byrnes">James F. Byrnes</a>, who went on to become the governor of South Carolina.

At the age of 12, Hogan left school to work as a stockboy in a local store. A stenographer taught him how to write in <a href="shorthand">shorthand</a>, a skill which proved valuable throughout his career. He became a stenographer himself, then worked as a railway clerk, a brokerage clerk, and a reporter for a local newspaper. In his spare time he schooled himself by reading books recommended by friends. 

In 1898 he joined the U.S. Army and put his clerical and railway experience to work in <a href="logistics">logistics</a>, serving as secretary to the Chief Quartermaster of the Army, secretary to the Quartermaster General in Washington, and Secretary to the Chief of Staff of the Army. After work he spent his evenings studying law at <a href="Georgetown%20Law">Georgetown University</a>. He completed the three-year program in two years, graduating at the head of his class in 1902.

Law career.
After graduation, Hogan went into private practice. At first he practiced law part-time in the evenings while working for the War Department during the day. He co-founded a Washington law firm, Hogan & Hartson, in 1904. From 1912 to 1919, he lectured at Georgetown University on the law of wills, evidence, and partnership. 

Hogan rose to national fame working on several high-profile cases in the 1920s and 30s. His most notable case was his defense of oil tycoon <a href="Edward%20L.%20Doheny">Edward L. Doheny</a> and the <a href="Pan-American%20Petroleum%20and%20Transport%20Company">Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company</a> in a series of trials from 1924 to 1930. In what came to be known as the <a href="Teapot%20Dome%20scandal">Teapot Dome scandal</a>, Doheny was accused of bribing Interior Secretary <a href="Albert%20Fall">Albert Fall</a> to lease the the oil production rights at <a href="Elk%20Hills%20Oil%20Field">Elk Hills Oil Field</a>. The company was forced to cancel its lease, but Hogan succeeded in clearing Doheny on charges of bribery and conspiracy to defraud the government. In 1935 he successfully defended <a href="Andrew%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a> on charges of tax evasion, and was featured on the cover of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine the same year. Other clients included former president <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, the <a href="General%20Electric%20Company">General Electric Company</a>, <a href="Armour%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Armour & Co.</a>, and <a href="Swift%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Swift & Co.</a> Reportedly, he once said that "the best client is a rich man who is scared."

American Bar Association.
From 1930-31 Hogan served as president of the Washington Lawyers' Club, and from 1932-33 he was president of the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia%20Bar">District of Columbia Bar</a> Association. In 1932, he organized the entertainment for the ABA when it held its 55th annual meeting in Washington D.C., and in this way became interested in the Bar's national organization. He was elected to its Executive Committee in 1933, served on the Budget Committee, and helped create the ABA's House of Delegates in 1936.

He became the first D.C. lawyer to serve as president of the ABA when he was unanimously elected in 1938. During his tenure he created the Committee on the Bill of Rights. Among other things, the Committee filed an <a href="amicus%20brief">amicus brief</a> in "<a href="Hague%20v.%20Committee%20for%20Industrial%20Organization">Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization</a>", an important freedom of assembly case. Hogan also supported the conservative Walter-Logan bill, which was passed by Congress and would have imposed strict constraints on federal administrative agencies had it not been vetoed by <a href="Presidency%20of%20Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">President Roosevelt</a>. A precursor to the <a href="Administrative%20Procedure%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Administrative Procedure Act</a>, the bill was criticized by some as an attempt to undermine the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a>.

1938 radio address.
On December 11, 1938, under the auspices of the General Jewish Council, Hogan denounced racial and religious intolerance in a half-hour speech aimed at fellow Catholics. Titled "An American Catholic Speaks on Intolerance," Hogan's speech (excerpted below) was interpreted as a rebuke of <a href="Charles%20Coughlin">Charles Coughlin</a>, an <a href="antisemitic">antisemitic</a> priest whose weekly radio broadcasts attracted millions of listeners across the country. Although Hogan never mentioned Coughlin by name, the implication was clear: his speech was aired on the same 34 radio stations used by Coughlin, immediately following Coughlin's regular broadcast.

Upon the unquestionable authority of Pius the Eleventh as given to the world in his public utterances, I speak today to refute any idea that any one who preaches racial or religious intolerance speaks for the Catholic laymen or the Catholic priesthood...

[O]ne hate breeds another. Wherever Jews are persecuted, there too other creeds and races will sooner or later be persecuted. This was true of the Ku Klux Klan in our own country, the Klan whose hatred was not limited to Catholics, but included Jews and Negroes as well.

One thing is becoming ever more clear to serious students of history. That the Jews have become the barometer of democracy throughout the world. Where they are oppressed, as in Germany, democracy and freedom have been utterly destroyed, and Christians have also suffered. Where they are the equals of all other citizens, as in America, democracy lives and flourishes, and all men are free whatever their faith.

The speech was widely quoted in newspapers the following day. The full text was reprinted in the "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Press">Pittsburgh Press</a>".

Personal life.
Hogan married Mary Cecil Adair of Savannah, Georgia, in 1899. The couple had a daughter, Dorothy. In addition to his professional work, Hogan served for a time as vice president of the <a href="Shakespeare%20Association%20of%20America">Shakespeare Association of America</a>. He also collected rare books and manuscripts, which he kept in a library on the top floor of his home. By the time of his death, the Frank J. Hogan Library was one of the world's most valuable private collections. The books were sold at auction in New York in 1945 and 1946. 

After completing his term as president of the ABA, he was forced to retire due to poor health. He died at his home in Washington, D.C., on May 15, 1944, after a long illness.

Awards.
Hogan received a commendation from the Secretary of War, <a href="Newton%20D.%20Baker">Newton D. Baker</a>, for his pro-bono services to veterans of World War I. His honorary degrees included an LL.D. from Georgetown University (1925), LL.D. from <a href="Laval%20University">Laval University</a> (1929), D.C.L. from the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> (1939), and LL.D. from <a href="Manhattan%20College">Manhattan College</a> (1939). At a special service in Jerusalem in 1931, he received an award of the <a href="Equestrian%20Order%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre</a>.

Homelessness in the Netherlands

Homelessness in the Netherlands is a social problem that is quickly on the rise. The increase is a consequence of cuts in welfare.

Statistics.
In 2015 31,000 people did not have a permanent place to stay, 13,000 more than in 2009 (74% increase over 6 years). The increase of non-Western population was larger, about 100%. Especially among young people homelessness is high. Between January 2015 and 2016 homelessness among people aged 18 through 30 increased from 8,000 to 12,400, an increase of 55% in just one year.

In international comparison, the proportion of homelessness among legals in the Netherlands (0.19%) is slightly higher than homelessness in the United States (0.18%), slightly lower than in France (0.21%), and lower than in the United Kingdom (0.31%) and Germany (0.35%). Official statistics of homelessness in the Netherlands are collected by <a href="Statistics%20Netherlands">Statistics Netherlands</a> and do not include large numbers of homeless illegals.

Housing solutions.
Several organizations in the Netherlands, among which the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a>, offer places to stay for a night. Reasons that many homeless people do not want to sleep in shelters, sometimes even when it freezes, include high drunkenness among residents, fighting, screaming, sexual harassment, and stealing of personal properties by residents of shelters.

Homeless sleep in the streets, alleys, under bidges, in fields, dunes, along highways, in forests or illegealy enter buildings. The number of outside dwellers is higher in the summer than in the winter, when additional places are offered in the shelters. It is illegal to sleep without permit on property that isn't one own's so homeless people regularly get fined.

<doc id="54963792" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54963792" title="Old Winona Middle School">
Old Winona Middle School

The Old Winona Middle School is a former school complex in <a href="Winona%2C%20Minnesota">Winona, Minnesota</a>, United States. The east building was originally constructed as the Winona High School" from 1915 to 1917 and the west building was added as the Winona Junior High School in 1926. An auditorium was added to the rear of the east building in 1928. The property was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> as the Winona High School and Winona Junior High School"' in 2004 for having local significance in the theme of education. It was nominated for representing local efforts to implement progressive educational trends in updated facilities, while offering cultural expriences to the wider community through professional music performances in the auditorium.

An <a href="adaptive%20reuse">adaptive reuse</a> project completed in 2004 converted the former school into the Washington Crossing apartments.

Construction.
Winona's original high school was built on the site of the west building in 1887. By the early 20th century the student body had swollen to twice the intended capacity of the building, pushing instructional spaces into the attic, basement, and stairwells. The Winona Board of Education began planning a new high school in 1913, purchasing the neighboring lot across Washington Street and ultimately hiring architect <a href="Clarence%20H.%20Johnston%20Sr.">Clarence H. Johnston Sr.</a> of <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul</a>, who had recently designed what is now Phelps Hall at <a href="Winona%20State%20University">Winona State University</a>. The board also took the opportunity to incorporate the latest trends in education, such as classrooms for both academic and vocational training, and large windows for maximum sunlight (which was considered to promote student health and cleanse classrooms). Construction began in September 1915 and the district's 10th, 11th, and 12th grades moved into the new building in February 1917.

The 1887 building was adapted for another new educational trend, the <a href="junior%20high%20school">junior high school</a>, created to provide more of a transition for students between elementary and high school. Initially only eighth and ninth grade met there, leaving seventh grade at the elementary school. In 1922 the board of education prioritized construction of a new junior high school building on the site of the old. The firm of <a href="Croft%20%26amp%3B%20Boerner">Croft & Boerner</a> was hired, with <a href="William%20B.%20Ittner">William B. Ittner</a> of St. Louis as a consulting architect. The new facility was designed to complement the high school across the street. Construction began in February 1925, with half the building complete and available for classes in September of that year and the other half ready in January 1926.

The district's next priority project was a gymnasium, another reflection of new educational principles. William B. Ittner was hired back to design a combined gymnasium and auditorium, with a swimming pool in the basement. Again it was closely matched to the style and color of the existing facilities. Construction began in summer 1927 and was complete in December of the following year.

Changing use.
In 1967 the <a href="Winona%20Senior%20High%20School">Winona Senior High School</a> was constructed at 901 Gilmore Avenue, and both buildings on Broadway became the Winona Junior High School. In 1988 the junior high school was renamed the Winona Middle School as ninth grade was shifted to the new high school and sixth grade moved in from the elementary school. However the facility was noticeably aging, lacked space for athletic fields, and was awkwardly split into two buildings. Whether to renovate or relocate proved to be a contentious local issue for years. Two <a href="referendum">referendum</a>s to renovate the existing facilities were defeated, but a referendum to construct a new middle school passed in 1997.

Proposals for what to do with the existing school buildings included reuse for <a href="subsidized%20housing">subsidized housing</a>, a university dormitory, a teen community center, or expansion space for the adjacent <a href="Winona%20Public%20Library">Winona Public Library</a>. A special task force ultimately voted in 1998 to sell the buildings to MetroPlains, a Saint Paul-based redeveloper, for conversion into affordable housing.

Meanwhile the new Winona Middle School was constructed at 1570 Homer Road. The final day of classes in the old school was June 7, 2000. That fall, as students began attending the new middle school, renovation work was delayed when the <a href="Winona%20County%20Courthouse">Winona County Courthouse</a> flooded and the west school building was pressed into service to house county offices. Renovations to convert the old middle school into the Washington Crossing apartment complex ultimately took place from July 2003 to October 2004, and new tenants began moving in that December.

Auditorium.
The Washington Crossing renovation did not include the 1928 auditorium/gymnasium attached to the east building, and it has sat vacant since 2000. Pipes burst over the winter have left standing water in the auditorium's balcony and in front of the stage, though the facility remains structurally sound. Options for reuse, however, are complicated by the fact that the city has already restored the <a href="Winona%20Masonic%20Temple">Winona Masonic Temple</a> into a community theater space just a block away.

The Welcome Home

The Welcome Home is an American <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> band from <a href="Athens%2C%20Georgia">Athens, Georgia</a> composed of Ryan Steffes, Alec Parrish, and brother duo Ethan and Lane Langston.

History.
Early Years and Formation.
The band's founding members, Ryan Steffes and Ethan Langston, met in <a href="Athens%2C%20GA">Athens, GA</a> during their first year attending the <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">University of Georgia</a> in 2013. Steffes had lined up an opening gig at the local Athens venue "New Earth Music Hall" (now called Live Wire Athens) and put together a band to back him up which included Ethan Langston and Ally Brady. Following the show, Steffes asked the group if they would be interested in forming a band, which led to its creation. For several months, the band debated numerous names before finally deciding on The Welcome Home, a title formulated by Steffes. A few months later, in November 2014, the group officially added Ethan’s brother, Lane Langston, as its lead electric guitarist. And after working with temporary drummers for several months, the band added local Athens drummer, Alec Parrish, to its official lineup.

2014-2015: "A Land Outside of This".
In the summer of 2015, the band recorded its first studio EP, titled “A Land Outside of This,” consisting of 5 original songs, preceded by an intro track. The release was accepted exceptionally online, as the band saw streaming numbers grow quickly on music platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. This led to fan bases starting elsewhere in the country, and in some cases outside the country, as they saw reviews coming in from elsewhere in the world. Somewhat constrained by their university-related commitments, the band mostly played shows in Atlanta and Athens during the "A Land Outside of This" album cycle. This led to several opportunities in their hometown, such as being featured on the University of Georgia’s primary hype video for senior day, the final home football game of the 2015 season.

2016-Present: "Remember the Monarchs (Acoustic)", Lineup Changes, and New Studio Releases.
As the band’s following continued to grow, they joined bigger acts in Athens’ premier venues such as the <a href="Georgia%20Theatre">Georgia Theatre</a> and the <a href="40%20Watt%20Club">40 Watt Club</a>. In the summertime of 2016, the group was featured on the main stage at the Athens based festival, <a href="Athfest">Athfest</a>, and on the festival’s annual compilation CD along with legendary Athens bands such as <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a> and <a href="Drive-By%20Truckers">Drive-By Truckers</a>. They also self-recorded and released an acoustic version of their biggest hit and single from the first EP, Remember the Monarchs. Since then, the band has been working on writing and recording new music, which is set to release before the end of this year. In May 2017, the group announced that their long-time keyboardist and vocalist, Ally Brady, would be leaving the band for personal reasons, as she transitioned into a new stage of life.

GEAR (theatre show)

GEAR (<a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>: ギア) is a <a href="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="long-run">long-run</a> non-verbal theatre show that originates in <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a> and incorporates elements of technology, skilled performance arts. It is the first long-run show with original content in Japan.

History.
GEAR was first created by Art Complex in <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a> as a project of the Osaka Regional Arts and Cultural Promotion Project Plan. After several successful runs promoted by different cultural affairs agencies in the <a href="Kansai%20region">Kansai</a> region, it opened as a long run show in a specially designated theatre in downtown Kyoto in April 2012. It is currently in its fifth year of performances.
Content.
GEAR follows four robots who work in a falling-apart toy factory in the distant future. An electrical accident brings one of the dolls they manufacture to life, and Doll and Robots learn together the value of play and humanity. Each robot discovers a special skill they have, and so the show gradually incorporates <a href="Mime%20artist">mime</a>, <a href="juggling">juggling</a>, <a href="Breakdancing">breakdance</a>, and <a href="Magic%20%28illusion%29">magic</a>. 

Another distinguishing mark of GEAR is the extensive use of <a href="Theatre%20tech">stage technology</a>. <a href="Projection%20mapping">Projection mapping</a> is used extensively, as are <a href="Laser">lasers</a>, an <a href="Light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> dress, and <a href="Stage%20lighting">moving lighting</a>. In the words of Japan Times reviewer Andrew Eglinton: In contrast, the production was lent a particularly powerful dimension through projection-mapping technology that allowed the crew to project light and video designs onto isolated parts of the Modernist factory to create the impression of a futuristic, automated world. In “Gear,” though, projection-mapping animates the space and enables fast-paced scene changes, and is also used to turn audience members into mapping surfaces to conjure a remarkable holistic experience.

Venue.
The long-term theatre for GEAR is a building in downtown Kyoto called 1928. The building was built in 1928, and used to house the Kyoto branch of the Osaka <a href="Mainichi%20Shimbun">Mainichi</a> Newspaper. The building has many <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> embellishments and is a good example of <a href="Taish%C5%8D%20period">Taisho Era</a> <a href="Japanese%20architecture">Japanese architecture</a>.

History.
The Ceylon College of Technology (CCT) was thus established at Katubedda in 1966 which offered a practically oriented engineering diploma (Diploma in Technology, abbreviated to DipTech) equivalent to a degree which was developed and offered with the technical assistance of UNESCO. The CCT commenced with specialisations in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, initially utilising the physical facilities available at the IPT. The IPT continued in the same premises with its full-time courses, but was amalgamated with the CCT in 1967 and the JTO course was restructured and named as the Technician's course. Arising of a perceived need to separate technical education at lower than degree level from the main university, the <a href="http%3A//www.mrt.ac.lk/itum/">Institute of Technology University of Moratuwa (ITUM)</a> was established with effect from 10 March 2000 to conduct the <a href="National%20Diploma%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29">National Diploma in Technology</a> course separately from the Faculty of Engineering, with the Ordinance for the same having been gazetted in August 2000.

Basavapunniah</a> tried to convince them to reject the revolt. In Delhi Singh argued against the line of the party leadership and resigned from the party. He joined the Bihar affiliate of the <a href="All%20India%20Coordination%20Committee%20of%20Communist%20Revolutionaries">All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries</a>, the Bihar Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries. During this phase Singh befriended <a href="Satyanarayan%20Singh">Satyanarayan Singh</a>.

Singh affirmed that the principal contradiction in Indian context stood between feudalism and the broad masses of the people (as opposed to seeing imperialist hegemony as the principal enemy). Subsequently Singh split away from Satyanarayan Singh's party led a party of his own for a few years, called the <a href="Central%20Organising%20Committee%2C%20Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist%29%20%28Umadhar%20Singh%29">Central Organising Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist)</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="Central%20Organising%20Committee%2C%20Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist%29">COC, CPI(ML)</a> formed in 1974).

Singh became a member of the COI(ML) <a href="Central%20Committee">Central Committee</a>.

<doc id="54964173" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54964173" title="Elisabeth Cavazza">
Elisabeth Cavazza

Elisabeth Cavazza (known as E. Cavazza, later as Elisabeth Pullen; 1849–1926) was an American author, journalist, and music critic.

Accustomed to speaking Italian and English, she received thorough training in singing, piano, and musical theory. When little more than a school-girl in <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, she was taught journalism by <a href="Stanley%20Pullen">Stanley Pullen</a>, then the youthful owner and chief editor of the "Portland Press," for whose columns she wrote unsigned verse, sketches and book reviews, acting also as musical critic. A parody in the manner of <a href="Algernon%20Charles%20Swinburne">Algernon Charles Swinburne</a>'s "Atalanta", "Algernon in London" deceived some leading members of the <a href="Century%20Association">Century Club</a> of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, from whom she received a card of admission to that club, sent on the supposition that the drama was the work of a man. A second parody, in which <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a> figured was not only forgiven by the poet, but also rewarded by a letter. In 1885, she was married to Nino Cavazza of <a href="Modena">Modena</a>, Italy, who was then in the last stage of illness, and he died in her mother's house a few weeks after. She at once resumed writing, becoming known to readers of magazines as E. Cavazza, and published a volume of stories of Calabrian peasant life, entitled "Don Finimondone". She was editor of the Italian department of the "Transatlantic", and on the editorial staff of the Boston "Literary World", also contributing to many periodicals. In 1894, she was married to Stanley Pullen. Her writings signed thereafter as Elisabeth Pullen. She was also the author of "The Man from Aidone", "Rocco and Sidora", and "Mr. Whitman", as well as translations from the Italian and the French. Her poetical tragedies, "Algernon in London" and "Algernon the Footstool-Bearer", published in the Portland "Transcript", attracted wide attention in the United States and England.

Early years and education.
Elisabeth Jones was born in <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a>, 1849. She was the daughter of Charles (1801-1859 and Anna (Davies) Jones. Charles came from a seagoing family who were traders in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. He was a leading man in Portland in his day, and was largely instrumental in the welfare and upbuilding of that city. He served as president of the Gas Company and managing director of the Portland Company, of which concerns he was also the practical founder and organizer. He died when his daughter was very young.

Accustomed from childhood to speak both the English and Italian languages, enacting dramas with her dolls, intensely interested in Shakespeare's fairies, the demons of "<a href="Dante%27s%20Inferno">Dante's Inferno</a>" and stories of the Greek gods and heroes—her early years were not like those of a typical child of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. She received a thorough musical education, which included singing, the <a href="pianoforte">pianoforte</a>, harmony and <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>. As a young girl, she was much interested in musical matters, and received a fine musical education, but her interest soon turned more strictly to literature.

Career.
She began writing for the Portland papers, and was so successful in this as to be encouraged to more ambitious efforts. She had for several years been a regular reviewer and contributor to the "Boston Literary World". Professor <a href="William%20Milligan%20Sloane">William Milligan Sloane</a>, editor of the "New Princeton Review", was the first to accept a story by Cavazza for a magazine. This story was called "A <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a>n Penelope", and those who read it were struck, not only by the literary ability displayed, but by the novelty and freshness of the subject, namely: the life of Calabrian peasants in Italy. Some little time before this story appeared, Cavazza came into some prominence on account of two comic tragedies contributed to the "Portland Press" and dealing with eccentric episodes in the poet Swinburne's life.

A review of <a href="Edmund%20Clarence%20Stedman">Edmund Clarence Stedman</a>'s "Victorian Poets" won from the eminent critic a flattering letter in regard to the young journalist. She had an unwillingness to be known to write, and, so well was the mystery maintained, that one day after the publication of her parody upon Swinburne's "Atalanta in Calydon," there arrived at the "Press" office a letter enclosing a card of invitation to the Century Club, which bore the endorsement of Stedman, <a href="Bayard%20Taylor">Bayard Taylor</a>, <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Stoddard">Richard Henry Stoddard</a>, and <a href="August%20Rodney%20Macdonough">August Rodney Macdonough</a>, who assumed the author of the parody to be a man. This parody was quoted by the "<a href="London">London</a> Saturday Review" as the best sample of this kind of literature on this side of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>.

A second pseudo-Greek drama "Algernon, the Foot-Stool Bearer," in which Swinburne and <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a> were parodied, was rewarded by a charming letter from Mr. Browning. Just before Bayard Taylor sailed for Germany to assume the post of Minister at <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, he came to Portland on purpose to see the young girl and speak encouragingly to her concerning her literary future. Later, she was honored by the warm friendship of <a href="John%20Greenleaf%20Whittier">John Greenleaf Whittier</a>. Prof. <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a> thanked her in a letter for a long poem published in the "Press" on occasion of his 75 birthday; and when, in September, 1888, a statue of the poet was unveiled in his native city, Cavazza was invited to write a poem, which was read upon the occasion. Besides her work in fiction and for the "Literary World", she werote considerably on contemporary Italian literature for the "<a href="Atlantic%20Monthly">Atlantic Monthly</a>", and wass also a member of the staff of the "New World", <a href="Nicholas%20Paine%20Oilman">Nicholas Paine Oilman</a>'s review. Cavazza was an intimate friend of Mr. Whittier and of those of his relatives who resided in Portland, and attributed much of her encouragement to continue as a writer to their friendly words. Some of her short stories were issued as "Don Finimondone: Italian Sketches," 1892.

She was married in February, 1885, to Nino Cavazza, of Modena, Italy. He was a son of Cavaliere Alessandro Cavazza, professor of sculpture in the Royal Academy of Modena. His death occurred within a year from their marriage; but Mrs. Cavazza's early interest in all that relates to Italian life and manners was undoubtedly increased by her marriage. After the death of her husband, Cavazza found it best to adopt literary writing as a serious profession, which she had studied in her childhood. She wrote verse and prose for Portland journals, and some of the leading magazines and juvenile periodicals. She married Stanley T. Pullen, a journalist and financier of Portland, on September 8, 1894.

Herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria

Herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria usually involve disputes over land and/or cattle between herders (in particular the Fulani or Hausa) and farmers (for example the Tiv or Tarok).

The most impacted states are those of the Nigerian <a href="Middle%20Belt">Middle Belt</a> like <a href="Benue%20State">Benue</a>, <a href="Taraba%20State">Taraba</a> and <a href="Plateau%20State">Plateau</a>.

Since the Fourth Nigerian Republic’s founding in 1999, farmer-herder violence has killed thousands of people and displaced tens of thousands more. It followed a trend in the increase of farmer-herder conflicts throughout much of the western <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>, due to an expansion of agriculturist population and cultivated land at the expense of pasturelands; deteriorating environmental conditions, <a href="desertification">desertification</a> and <a href="soil%20degradation">soil degradation</a>; breakdown in traditional conflict resolution mechanisms of land and water disputes; and proliferation of small arms and crime in rural areas. Insecurity and violence have led many populations to create self-defence forces and ethnic militias, which have engaged in further violence. The majority of farmer-herder clashes have occurred between Muslim <a href="Fulani%20herdsmen">Fulani herdsmen</a> and Christian peasants, exacerbating ethnoreligious hostilities.

According to the <a href="Global%20Terrorism%20Index">Global Terrorism Index</a>, <a href="Fula%20people">Fulani</a> militants were the fourth deadliest terrorist group in 2014, using machine guns and attacks on villages to assault and intimidate farmers. After killing around 80 people in total from 2010 to 2013, they killed 1,229 in 2014. Most deaths occurred in the Nigerian <a href="Middle%20Belt">Middle Belt</a>, in particular in the states of <a href="Benue%20State">Benue</a>, <a href="Kaduna%20State">Kaduna</a>, <a href="Nasarawa%20State">Nasarawa</a>, <a href="Plateau%20State">Plateau</a> and <a href="Taraba%20State">Taraba</a>, which recorded 847 deaths. The state of <a href="Zamfara">Zamfara</a>, in the northern belt, recorded 229 deaths.

<doc id="54964472" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54964472" title="Dodecatemoria">
Dodecatemoria

Dodecatemoria are subdivisions of the twelve <a href="Astrological%20sign">signs</a> of the Zodiac into a further twelve parts each. These can be said to form a "micro-zodiac" of 144 dodecatemoria, each corresponding to 2.5° of the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>. In an alternate usage, the dodecamorion refers to a point on the ecliptic reached by the addition of twelve times a given number of degrees within a sign, either to the original degree, or to the beginning of the sign.

This system, used in <a href="Hellenistic%20astrology">Hellenistic astrology</a> but less favored by later ages, apparently originated in <a href="Babylonian%20astrology">Babylonian astrology</a>.

Name.
The name "dodecatemoria" is a Latinization of the Greek δωδεχατημόρια (singular Gr. δωδεχατημόριον, L. "dodecatemorium" or "dodecatemorion").

The Babylonians used the word 𒄩𒆷 (ḪA-LA), pronounced "zittu", defined as "share" and "part". <a href="Assyriology">Assyriologists</a> call this system the "microzodiac".

Calculation.
Within each sign, the dodecatemoria are arranged beginning with the sign itself and proceeding in the normal order. Thus, the first dodecatemorion in <a href="Virgo%20%28astrology%29">Virgo</a> is Virgo and the last is <a href="Leo%20%28astrology%29">Leo</a>.

The sign of the dodecatemorion can be found by multiplying the within-sign degree number by 12 and adding the result starting from the beginning of the sign. For example, to find the dodecatemorion of Capricorn 17 , multiply 17 by 12 to get 2014, and move 204° past the beginning of <a href="Capricorn%20%28astrology%29">Capricorn</a> (which begins 270° past Aries 0). One arrives at Cancer 24 (474 = 114° past <a href="Aries%20%28astrology%29">Aries</a>). <a href="Cancer">Cancer</a> is the seventh dodecatemorion of Capricorn, corresponding to Capricon 15–17.5°. At the same time, Cancer 24 can be given as the exact "dodecatemorion" of Capricorn 17.

In Manilius's "<a href="Astronomica%20%28Manilius%29">Astronomica</a>" the dodecatemoria are further subdivided into five half-degree parts, each corresponding to a planet.

In an alternative and seemingly older Mesopotamian system, the dodecatemorion of a point in the heavens is computed by adding the degree multiplied twelvefold not to 0° of its sign but to the exact degree in question. This method is equivalent to adding the degree multiplied thirteenfold to 0° of its sign.)

History.
<a href="Cuneiform">Cuneiform</a> tablets from Babylon, possibly originating under the period of Persian rule (539–331), describe the system of multiplying by 12 to find the dodecatemorion associated with a degree.

The earliest possible date for the use of the Babylonian microzodiac is naturally constrained by the earliest possible date for the zodiac itself, generally given as circa the <a href="fifth%20century%20BC">fifth century BC</a>.

The Babylonian system was apparently adopted by the Greeks, who frequently attributed astrological knowledge to <a href="Chaldeans">Chaldeans</a> or <a href="Egyptian%20astronomy">Egyptians</a>. The Latin authors <a href="Marcus%20Manilius">Manilius</a> and <a href="Julius%20Firmicus%20Maternus">Firmicus</a> both describe calculations of dodecatemoria. Ptolemy in the "<a href="Tetrabiblos">Tetrabiblos</a>", however, dismissed the computation of dodecatemoria as illogical.

Purpose.
Computation of dodecatemoria could have helped the ancient astronomer by, simply, giving him more symbolic data to interpret.

The dodecatemoria could also crudely represent the motion of the moon across the ecliptic during the course of one month. Possibly they use a "virtual moon", imagined conjunct with the Sun (i.e., <a href="New%20moon">new</a>) at the beginning of a sign, to symbolize divisions within the sign.

A Greek text (found in two existing codicies) connects the dodecatemoria with the "homo signorum" ("<a href="Zodiac%20Man">Zodiac Man</a>") in which zodiacal signs are allocated evenly across the body from Aries at the head to Pisces at the feet. In this text, body parts are listed alongside degree numbers 2, 5, 7, 10, etc., corresponding to increments of 2.5° rounded down. The order of body parts modifies the usual list to accommodate the special characteristics of the sign; for example, most of the animal signs have "tail" as their final part, while <a href="Scorpio%20%28astrology%29">Scorpio</a> has "sting", and the list in <a href="Gemini%20%28astrology%29">Gemini</a> and <a href="Pisces%20%28astrology%29">Pisces</a> is doubled.

Like the 12-part zodiac, division of the signs into body parts (equated at some point with the signs) could have allowed ancient astronomers to describe parts of the sky (and record observations of celestial bodies located therein) with greater precision and convenience. Late Babylonian texts also give rising times for dodecatemoria during the course of a single day.

3 points: The ball knocks over the <a href="cone">cone</a> or goes through the FooBaSKILL goal.

0 points: The ball touches the top of the box. The game continues uninterrupted.

After a scored point.
The kick-off for the following action is made as soon as possible at the place where the ball is recovered by the defender. The player puts the ball on the ground with at least one hand and the game restarts instantly with a pass.

An Organic Whole of All and Everything

The central idea of the book is the science & art of spiritual evolution, based on the understanding emanating from synthesis of the 4th Way, Hindu-Sufi Spirituality and Modern Sciences into an organic whole of the spiritual & material aspects of both, man & the universe. Its core essence is inter-woven in and through all ideas and diagrams presented in the book. All other ideas revolve around the idea of spiritual evolution, and have been connected and presented from that point of view. Another important idea is that everything has degrees, and normally the process of evolution proceeds in degrees; after attaining a definite threshold, one enters the next level of being, and that within each level of evolution there are degrees. So, it requires consistent efforts for a long time along with the understanding of various levels and degrees within each level. Further, one needs to understand that things have inner meaning, and things are inter-connected. And for the understanding of inter-connections among things, levels of evolution and degrees therein, one needs to have a picture of the whole. The level of one’s spiritual being at a particular moment depends on one’s (1) state of consciousness; (2) degree of Will (control) over oneself, which includes the degree of inner purity as well, and (3) degree of inner Unity (inner non-duality) attained. Spiritual (psychological) evolution means evolution of one’s level of being, so the entire focus and significance of the ideas and Diagrams presented in this book are to be understood from this point of view. The efforts (that is, Sadhana) one does for his spiritual evolution is collectively termed as ‘The Work’ or ‘Work on oneself’ or simply as ‘Work’ in this book. In this book the words ‘Spiritual evolution’, ‘Psychological evolution’ or ‘Evolution’ mean the same thing. Sometimes one is used, sometimes another is used to emphasize a particular shade of the same thing, but basically all the three are used inter-changeably. G. I. <a href="Gurdjieff">Gurdjieff</a> and P. D. <a href="P.%20D.%20Ouspensky">Ouspensky</a> seem to have preferred the word ‘Psychological evolution’, whereas, in Hindu spirituality the word “Spiritual evolution’ (Brahm-Vidya) is used more. The psychological evolution discussed in this book is quite different from modern Human Psychology which doesn’t have any idea, or at least it doesn’t speak about the spiritual evolution possible for a human being.

Introduction

Basically this work is an endeavour to structure the organic whole of the spiritual (esoteric) knowledge, which is already available in fragments in various esoteric traditions and writings, by applying the principle of scale & relativity, and connecting important ideas according to their exact place and significance in that organic whole. This is done in a coherent manner, in simple Diagrams, to make its correct discerning easier. Understanding is a result of connecting things with the whole. If one does not have an idea of the whole, how can one connect, and how would understanding become possible? Without connecting a part's place and significance to the entire scheme of the whole, it would be like studying veins of a leaf in minute detail without knowing anything about the tree. In an attempt not to load it with lengthy theory, this is intentionally presented in simple diagrams and in brief topics, so that the grasp of the Picture of the Whole & Parts enter directly into our that part, which understands things without words (e.g., when one sees the symbol ‘+’ one understands its entire significance without words; word-less understanding is the focal point). Then, one may explore the minute details of a particular idea, keeping in view its relative place in that whole, in such a way that any possibility of lopsidedness or bias can be minimized. This results in and represents a higher method of learning. Wherever possible, the ideas have been presented in long sentences to evoke directed and controlled attention, and in short paragraphs to make its discerning easier. This exercise is an attempt to formulate it as an essential clue, a roadmap, and an overall yardstick for understanding, applying and verifying the esoteric knowledge in one's own spiritual evolution. It needs to be understood, deeply felt, and practically applied and explored, in non-identified way in one's personal work (sadhana). For a right and scientific understanding of higher spiritual (esoteric) ideas, the searchlight of the Law of Three and the Principle of Scale & Relativity, as expounded by G. I. Gurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky in the 4th Way books namely, Beelzebub’s Tails to his Grandson and In Search of the Miraculous is of a great help.

Keeping this searchlight in mind, one may explore (1) the writing of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Buddha</a>; (2) the higher understanding of the human psyche, and the literary beauty and meaningdensity of words reflected in works of William Shakespeare, particularly in his Sonnets; (3) the <a href="Philokalia">Philokalia</a>; (4) <a href="Tao%20Te%20Ching">Tao Te Ching</a> of Laotzu; (5) <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> in general and as it is expounded in works of <a href="Dada%20Bhagwan">Dada Bhagwan</a> in particular; (6) Sufism in general and as it is reflected in poetry of Rumi and Hafiz in particular; (7) <a href="Patanjali">Patanjali</a>-Yoga-Sutras; (8) the <a href="Upanishads">Upnisadas</a>, particularly the Mandukya Upnisad; (9) the <a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagwad Geeta,</a> and (10) <a href="Vachanamrut">Vachnamrits</a> of Bhagwan Shri Swaminarayan. However, there is no limit to the esoteric exploration.

Attack on the Dureenbee

On 3 August 1942 the <a href="fishing%20trawler">fishing trawler</a> "Dureenbee" was attacked and badly damaged by <a href="Japanese%20submarine%20I-175">Japanese submarine "I-175"</a> off the town of <a href="Moruya%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Moruya, New South Wales</a>. Three of the trawler's crew were killed, and the ship was subsequently damaged beyond repair after running aground. While the incident has been called a war crime, Allied submarines also conducted similar attacks during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Background.
The "Dureenbee" was a fishing trawler of 223 tons displacement constructed in 1919. As of 1942, she belonged to <a href="Cam%20and%20Sons">Cam and Sons</a> and operated in the seas off the <a href="South%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">South Coast</a> of New South Wales. She was unarmed. Her crew comprised Captain William Reid and ten other men. Reid had served with the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> during World War I.

Two groups of Japanese submarines operated off the east coast of Australia in mid-1942. The first group arrived in May, and launched the <a href="Attack%20on%20Sydney%20Harbour">Attack on Sydney Harbour</a> on the 31st of the month. These submarines subsequently attacked merchant shipping until late June. A second group of three Japanese submarines comprising , and "I-175" commenced operations in mid-July.

"I-175" departed the Japanese base at <a href="Kwajalein">Kwajalein</a> in the central Pacific on 8 July 1942 to operate off Australia. This would be the submarine's fourth war patrol; during the previous three she had mainly operated off Hawaii. The only ship sunk during these patrols was the small United States merchant vessel "Mainini" on 17 December 1941. The submarine also shelled <a href="Palmyra%20%28Cooper%29%20Airport">Palmyra Naval Air Station</a> on <a href="Palmyra%20Atoll">Palmyra Atoll</a> on 24 December 1941.

On 23 July "I-175" torpedoed the Australian merchant vessel "Allara" off <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a>. While the ship's crew abandoned ship, she did not sink and was towed into Newcastle. The next day the submarine torpedoed and damaged the Australian merchant vessel "Murada" north-east of Newcastle. On 26 July she was attacked by , and withdrew to the south. Two days later "I-175" sank the French merchant vessel "Cagou" north-east of Newcastle, before proceeding south.

Attack.
At about 1:30 am on 3 August "Dureenbee" accidentally approached "I-175" during one of her fishing voyages. At this time the submarine was on the surface recharging its batteries. The trawler's crew were stowing recently-caught fish and dropping her <a href="fishing%20net">net</a>, and did not spot "I-175".

"I-175" initiated the engagement by opening fire on "Dureenbee" with her <a href="deck%20gun">deck gun</a>. The first <a href="artillery%20shell">shell</a> missed, and exploded in the sea. After realising the trawler was under attack, "Dureenbee"s radio operator sent a <a href="distress%20signal">distress signal</a>. The submarine's crew then opened fire with <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, which destroyed the trawler's radio room and badly wounded the radio operator. Two more shells were fired at "Dureenbee", with both striking the vessel. The shells destroyed the trawler's <a href="Bridge%20%28nautical%29">wheel house</a> and crippled her engine, leaving the vessel motionless.

Following the initial barrage Reid attempted to contact the Japanese sailors by yelling "don't fire! We are only a harmless fishing boat". This had no effect, and "I-175" circled the trawler for 45 minutes. During this time her deck gun continued to fire on "Dureenbee". The submarine then submerged, and reappeared six minutes later travelling out to sea.

After "I-175" disappeared, Reid fired several <a href="Flare%20gun">distress flares</a> to summon assistance. At this time one member of the trawler's crew was dead, and another two seriously wounded. All of the other sailors had survived the attack with only minor injuries by sheltering behind machinery. 

Shortly after the attack on "Dureenbee" commenced, members of the Moruya <a href="Volunteer%20Defence%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Volunteer Defence Corps</a> unit asked the co-owners of the trawler "Mirrabooka" and one of their crew to put to sea as a rescue vessel. They agreed, and departed the town at 2:30 am. At 6:20 am "Dureenbee" was spotted by a patrolling <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> aircraft, which directed "Mirrabooka" towards her. Once "Mirrabooka" arrived alongside "Dureenbee" the damaged trawler's surviving crew and the body of the dead sailor were transferred across. One of the badly wounded sailors died on board "Mirrabooka", and the third died in hospital several days later.

Aftermath.
An attempt was made to locate and salvage "Dureenbee" on the morning of 4 August. "Mirrabooka" was also used for this task, having been commandeered by two members of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Salvage%20Board">Commonwealth Salvage Board</a>. Following a search, "Dureenbee" was found aground on rocks off the North Head of <a href="Batemans%20Bay%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Batemans Bay</a>. An attempt to tow "Dureenbee" off the rocks was unsuccessful, with "Mirrabooka" also nearly running aground and having to be rescued by the trawler "Erina". No further attempts to recover "Dureenbee" were made, though local fishermen removed equipment from the wreck before it sank. 

Following the attack "I-175" proceeded north, and took up a station to the south of <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a>. On 7 August she was ordered to abandon her patrol off Australia to operate off <a href="Makira">San Cristobal</a> in the Solomon Islands in response the the United States <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">landing on Guadalcanal</a> that day. Five days later two US Navy aircraft attacked and damaged the submarine south-west of <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a>, forcing her to break off her patrol for repairs. She arrived at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on 17 August.

The three members of "Dureenbee"s who were killed in the attack were buried at Moruya Cemetery, with their graves being marked by <a href="Merchant%20Navy">Merchant Navy</a> headstones. Six RAAF airmen killed during World War II are also buried in the cemetery. The remnants of the trawler still lie in the sea off what is now the <a href="Murramarang%20National%20Park">Murramarang National Park</a>. As of 2017, it was not a protected site.

An account published during World War II labelled the attack on "Dureenbee" to have been "murder and piracy on the high seas". A postwar author has labelled it "barbarism". However, Allied submarines conducted many such attacks on Japanese fishing boats in the belief that they formed part of the Japanese war economy. In 2017 a local amateur historian noted that "Dureenbee"s catch would have been used to feed Australian soldiers.

Gina Rippon (born 1950) is professor of <a href="Cognitive%20neuroscience">cognitive neuroimaging</a> at the Aston Brain Centre, <a href="Aston%20University">Aston University</a>, Birmingham. Rippon has also sat on the editorial board of the "<a href="International%20Journal%20of%20Psychophysiology">International Journal of Psychophysiology</a>"

Education.
Rippon gained her PhD in 1982.

Research.
Rippon's research involves the application of brain imaging techniques, particularly <a href="electroencephalography">electroencephalography</a>,(EEG) and <a href="magnetoencephalography">magnetoencephalography</a> (MEG) using cognitive neuroscience paradigms to studies of normal and abnormal cognitive processes. This work has been applied to the study of <a href="Autistic%20spectrum%20disorders">Autistic Spectrum Disorders</a> and to <a href="developmental%20dyslexia">developmental dyslexia</a>.

Criticism of 'neurotrash'.
Rippon is critical of what she sees as the misrepresentation and hijacking of neuroscience, what she calls 'neurotrash'. "The logic of their argument is that males and females are biologically different, men and women are behaviourally different, so their behavioural differences are biologically caused and cannot and, more importantly, should not be challenged or changed. I aim to... produce a guide to spotting such ‘neurononsense’."

As an example she describes how a report examining new ways to look at the brain, considering pathways and connections, rather than structures, was used by the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" to infer that women and ethnic minorities are inferior.

Books which Rippon cites as examples of neurotrash include:

She would like people to question research findings from neuroscientists in terms of <a href="effect%20size">effect size</a>, she is critical of neuroscientists who describe "slight" statistical differences between the genders as "significant" differences in their findings. Rippon also says, if you are going to look at brain volume differences then you need to know how heavy and how tall those people are – a volume correction, otherwise the data is meaningless, and not all researchers, she says, do that. Another worry for Rippon is a <a href="publication%20bias">publication bias</a>, that publishers will only publish when a difference is found rather than publishing research proving there are no differences.

Neurotrashers, she says, "extrapolate wildly" and such science can be used for "<a href="Social%20engineering%20%28political%20science%29">social engineering</a>" to reinforce perceived male and female roles and status, an example of the kind argument she feels could be deployed is, "You are what your brain can do, and if your brain can’t do tricky things like running a country, designing a bridge, starting a war, you shouldn’t try and society shouldn’t let you."

Rippon is also opposed to the "continued emphasis on '<a href="Gender%20essentialism">essentialist</a>', brain-based explanations in both public communication of, and research into, many forms of gender imbalance."

Media appearances.
Rippon has appeared on a number of media broadcasts within the UK discussing the neurosciences in terms of the male and female brain, such as the "<a href="Horizon%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Horizon</a>" programme, "Is your Brain Male or Female?" <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>'s "<a href="Today%20%28BBC%20Radio%204%29">Today</a>" programme alongside professor <a href="Robert%20Winston">Robert Winston</a>, and "No More Boys And Girls: Can Our Kids Go Gender Free?" for the BBC.

Ata Hoe

Ata Hoe (c. 1790 - 1810) was a daughter of the <a href="Ng%C4%81puhi">Ngāpuhi</a> chief <a href="Te%20Pahi">Te Pahi</a>. She lived in the <a href="Rangihoua%20Bay">Rangihoua Bay</a> area of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Islands">Bay of Islands</a> and was also known as Mary Bruce.

As a teenager, between 1806 and 1808, Ata Hoe was given in marriage by her father to an English man, George Bruce. Bruce had been a crew member on a voyage from Sydney to New Zealand in 1806 during which Te Pahi had fallen ill and Bruce had cared for him. In 1808 Ata Hoe accompanied Bruce on the "General Wellesley", a ship travelling to <a href="North%20Cape%20%28New%20Zealand%29">North Cape</a> in search of gold dust. However, the ship's captain, Captain Dalrymple, failed to find gold and instead of returning the pair to the Bay of Islands sailed for India via <a href="Malacca%20City">Malacca</a>.

Arriving in Malacca in December 1808, Bruce disembarked to lay a complaint about Dalrymple's behavior, but while he was ashore Dalrymples left for <a href="Penang">Penang</a>, with Ata Hoe on board. Bruce met the ship at Penang and the couple returned to Malacca to wait for a ship destined for New Zealand. As no ship was found, they instead sailed for Calcutta in late 1809, seeking a passage home. They found and joined the ship "Union," which was sailing to Tasmania and then Sydney; only a few days after leaving Calcutta, Ata Hoe gave birth to a daughter. Ata Hoe contracted <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> while in Sydney however, and died in February 1810. Her daughter was placed with the Female Orphan School and George Bruce returned to England, where he died in 1819 at the age of 40.

Later life.

By (city or town)

By is the name of a city or a town in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> and <a href="Norway">Norway</a>.

Etymology.
The word "by" comes from <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> word "býr", which means a space with several buildings. The words by and bygd originally have the same meaning. By refers to buildings that are close to a restricted area, while bygd refers to scattered settlements in a larger geographic landscape. The first "byer" in Norway were thus not the commercial towns Tønsberg or Trondheim, early settlements getting the suffix by. The root was a short one-letter name that described the people could see, names such as rock, mountain, hill, ridge, grove, birch, oak, ash, oak, bay etc.

The modern understanding of the term by in the Norwegian language, on the other hand, is quite different. It is in its function and origin related to trade, and our ancestors called their booming trading venues for "kaupanger". From Norway we know the kaupanger in "Skiringssal" as the oldest. Likewise, we know "Birka" in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> and "Hedeby" (Haithabu) in Denmark. In the Norse language these places were probably referred to as kaupanger, but the settlements where they were found were probably referred to as býr, and that can be a significant part of the explanation for why Danes and Norwegians today call their commercial places byer. The <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish language</a> has retained the original meaning, as the word is used for a village of a agricultural community, while the city or town is called the "stad".

Marie Hoheisel

Marie Hoheisel (born Maria Perzina: 16 June 1873 - 5 March 1947) was an <a href="Austria">Austrian</a> <a href="Feminist%20movement">women's rights activist</a>.

Life.
The daughter of Julius Perzina and Emmi Ehrlich von Treuenstätt, Maria Perzina was born in <a href="Liberec">Reichenberg</a>, at that time a major commercial and industrial city in <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austrian</a> northern <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> (and known after <a href="Expulsion%20of%20Germans%20from%20Czechoslovakia">1945</a> as Liberec in <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>). She grew up in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> where she attended a teacher training college, which she left in 1892.

Around this time she married , a talented and ambitious official in the imperial postal service, and the couple moved to <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> in connection with Konrad's work. In 1907 Konrad's work caused them to relocate to <a href="Linz">Linz</a>. In 1910 her husband was moved again, taking the couple, accompanied by this time by their two children Konrad and Emmi, back to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> where by 1918 Konrad Hoheisel had become national General Director for posts and telecommunications. 

While they were living in <a href="Linz">Linz</a> Marie Hohenheisel began working to improve living conditions for women. She concerned herself with wage levels and working conditions and also demanded better status and recognition by society for the work undertaken by women as wives and mothers. From her published articles and lectures/speeches from those years it is evident that her over-riding goal was legislative backing for the equal standing of men and women in the workplace and in society. In <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, supported by the pioneering feminist activist <a href="Marianne%20Hainisch">Marianne Hainisch</a>, from 1926 she focused on the campaign to introduce a US-style <a href="Mother%27s%20Day">Mother's Day</a> to the country. In 1928 she became chair of the Austrian Mothers' Day committee. Three years later she also took on the presidency of the , a position she retained till the League's dissolution in 1938 following the <a href="Anschluss">1938 merger (""Anschluss"")</a> of <a href="Austria">Austria</a> into <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.

In 1934 Hoheisel was also elected to the national committee of the "Women's Emergency Services" (""Frauen-Notdienst""). She also took a leading role in the Austrian <a href="Consumer%20protection">("Consumers' League") ""Konsumentenliga""</a>.<ref name=MHlautOBL> In 1937 an article that she contributed to a specialist journal entitled "Food price inflation, dual inclome legislation and their impact on socio-political issues" (""Lebensmittelteuerung und Doppelverdienergesetz und ihre bevölkerungspolitischen Folgen"") dealt with themes that are as important today as they were in 1937.

At the time of the <a href="Anschluss">"Anschluss"</a> Hoheisel was in her mid-60s. She lost or surrendered from her public appointments and for most purposes disappears from the public record. She died in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> in 1947.

Significance.
By a circuitous route, papers comprising Marie Hoheisel's "literary legacy" came into the possession of the Vienna Public Library and were transferred to the public archives at the <a href="Rathaus%2C%20Vienna">City Hall</a> in 2013. The resulting archive incorporates approximately 500 hand-written and typed documents that she produced, mostly during the period 1928-1936. Along with texts by Hoheisel, the archive contains written material from other feminist activist of the time, providing insights into the workings of the feminist network in Austria and internationally. The public accessibility of the archive has opened the way to a wider appreciation of a women's rights activists whose contribution had been largely overlooked during the <a href="Anschluss">Nazi years</a> and in the turmoil generated by the <a href="Second%20World%20War">war</a> and its <a href="Allied-occupied%20Austria">politically charged aftermath</a>.

The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt.
The August Coup or August Putsch lasted between 19–22 August 1991 and was an attempt by members of the Soviet Union’s government to take control of the country from the Soviet President and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.

August 19th, 1991.
As the coup attempt was taking place in Moscow and with that the military and political attention of the Soviet Union otherwise occupied, various republics of the Soviet Union took the opportunity to declare their independence. On the evening of the 19th of August, delegates from the Estonian Supreme Soviet and the Estonian Committee started negotiations to declare the independence of the Republic of Estonia. The main debate was a crucial one: should Estonia declare independence as a new Republic or continue with the juridical continuation of the Republic of Estonia established in <a href="Estonian%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">1918</a> and occupied in 1940. 

August 20th, 1991.
At 11:02 pm on the evening of August 20th, 1991, during a live broadcast carried out by the National Television, the Estonian Supreme Soviet voted on the declaration of its Restoration of Independence. Out of the 105 delegates of the Estonian Supreme Soviet 70 were present, 69 voted in favour of the restoration.

Jack Graham (Australian footballer, born 1998)

Jack Graham (born 25 February 1998) is a professional <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>er playing for the <a href="Richmond%20Football%20Club">Richmond Football Club</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Australian Football League</a> (AFL). He captained <a href="South%20Australia%20Australian%20rules%20football%20team">South Australia</a> at the <a href="2016%20AFL%20Under%2018%20Championships">2016 AFL Under 18 Championships</a> and won the <a href="Larke%20Medal">Larke Medal</a> as the competition's best player. 

Early life and junior football.
Graham spent his formative years in the North eastern <a href="Adelaide%2C%20South%20Australia">Adelaide</a> suburb of <a href="Greenwith%2C%20South%20Australia">Greenwith</a>. He played junior football with <a href="Tea%20Tree%20Gully%20Football%20Club">Tea Tree Gully</a> in the North Eastern Metro Junior Football Association. He later joined <a href="North%20Adelaide%20Football%20Club">North Adelaide</a>'s development program at age 12 where he began playing representative junior football.

In 2013 he captained the under 15s South Australian representative schoolboys team at the year's national championships. The following year he captained the premiership winning <a href="South%20Australia%20Australian%20rules%20football%20team">South Australia</a>n side at the Under 16 national championships.

Graham made his SANFL senior debut with North Adelaide in June 2015. He had 15 possessions in the match, along with six marks, three tackles and two clearances. That year he was also selected to play for his state at the under 18 national championships as a bottom aged player. He finished the tournament having played two matches.

In the 2015/16 off-season Graham was a member of the 33-man AFL Academy squad. As part of the program he spent a fortnight training with the AFL's in December 2015. He also joined the other members of the elite group in a training camp in Melbourne and another in the <a href="USA">USA</a>. A quad injury sustained during this period however, saw his summer partially interrupted.

In 2016 Graham was selected to represent and captain the South Australian side at the national under 18s carnival. He was named among his state's best players in three of his four games at the tournament His 25 disposals and five clearances per game both lead the competition while his 11 contested possessions saw him rank second. Graham also averaged 318 metres gained in his four matches at the carnival. Graham was awarded the <a href="Larke%20Medal">Larke Medal</a> as the competition's best player, becoming the first South Australian to do so in 14 years. He was later named in the competition's All Australian team and received South Australia’s most valuable player award.

At state level he also performed strongly that year, averaging 24 disposals per game in the SANFL under 18s through the start of June 2016. A quad injury saw Graham miss the club's finals campaign however and prematurely ended his final season at junior level.

AFL recruitment.
Graham was invited to attend the national draft combine in <a href="Melbourne%2C%20Victoria">Melbourne</a> in October of 2016. He did not complete pysical testing however due to a strained quad muscle.

South Australian junior high performance manager <a href="Brenton%20Phillips">Brenton Phillips</a> likened to Graham to 's <a href="Luke%20Hodge">Luke Hodge</a>, saying he was a "really hard, inside, contested-ball winner who probably spreads a bit harder than Hodge."

By the time the national draft came around in late November, Graham's stock had dropped considerably. While
The Herald projected Graham in the range 15 to 25, Fox Sport's Ben Waterworth was less confident, citing injuries and poor kicking as reasons for a late second or third round projection. ESPN's Christopher Doerre also had Graham as likely second or third round pick while he was ranked 42nd in Draft Central's projections. He was projected to be selected at pick 23 and pick 24 by AFL Media's Callum Twomey and The Age's Emma Quayle respectively in their draft day phantom drafts.

AFL career.
Graham was drafted by with the club's second pick and the fifty third selection overall in the <a href="2016%20AFL%20draft">2016 AFL national draft</a>. In the weeks following the draft, Richmond recruiting manager Matthew Clarke cited Graham's defensive running as a key reason for his selection in addition to his on-ball prowess. 

He trained under a limited program in the 2017 pre-season due to the effects of hamstring tendinitis. Graham remained in the clubs injury rehab ground until early March as a result of the injury, failing to play in the club's <a href="JLT%20Community%20Series">JLT Community Series</a> campaign. He suffered a further injury setback that month when he fractured his ankle during a club training session. In late June he was removed from the club's long-term injury list and played his first half of football with the club's reserves side in the <a href="Victorian%20Football%20League">VFL</a>. Graham sustained a further ankle injury after one half of VFL play in mid-July. He did not return to the match after a first half in which he recorded a stunning 21 disposals, 14 contested possessions, eight clearances and six tackles. He recovered from the injury after missing one match and returned to VFL football in late July.

He finally made his senior debut in round 22 of the <a href="2017%20AFL%20season">2017 AFL season</a> in an away match against at <a href="Subiaco%20Oval">Domain Stadium</a>. He kicked a goal in the match, along with recording 13 disposals and laying a game-high 11 tackles. In doing so he equaled <a href="Rupert%20Wills">Rupert Wills</a>' VFL/AFL record for the most tackles recorded on debut.

Doreen Valiente Foundation

Doreen Valiente is considered one of the founders of the modern “Wicca” movement along with Gerald Gardner, the man credited with reviving what has been described as Britain’s only indigenous religion, England being the birthplace of Wicca. She was also an author of great note in the field of magic, folklore, witchcraft and paganism and has been described by Professor Ronald Hutton of the University of Bristol as “.. the greatest single female figure in the modern British history of witchcraft”. Doreen was also one of the founders of the organisation now called the Pagan Federation, which, more than 40 years on, continues to represent modern day pagans in mainstream society in areas such as law, government, hospitals, schools and the wider community. She has an entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, was the author of books, which continue to sell today, and are frequently quoted as standard works in the study of contemporary paganism and modern British witchcraft. Both Doreen Valiente (Brighton) and Gerald Gardner (Highcliffe) have Heritage Blue Plaques commemorating the buildings where they lived.

The Doreen Valiente Collection
The Doreen Valiente Collection, owned by the Doreen Valiente Foundation, a charitable trust, is probably the most significant collection in the world of original artefacts and documents related to the twentieth century rise of modern-day witchcraft (“Wicca”) which paved the way for the development of awareness and cultural acceptance of modern-day interpretations of paganism into society. The latter part of the millennium saw underground indigenous British religious and spiritual traditions become worldwide phenomena and begin to take their place in mainstream society, the 2011 census showed Paganism as Britain’s seventh largest faith group. As the author of some of the religious texts that are used in modern-day Wicca, the Doreen Valiente Collection naturally contains a number of these original manuscripts.
Doreen Valiente was an inveterate collector of material relating to folklore, witchcraft and other allied interests. Nearly all of the witchcraft-related material, which she accumulated, passed to John Belham-Payne upon her death. He passed ownership of the collection through a Deed of Trust to the Doreen Valiente Foundation.

However, in 1982, Magnus had dropped out of school without a degree, got involved with the <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> and <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> scenes, and bounced around places and jobs. Seeing no perspectives for the future in Britain, he decided to follow the <a href="American%20Dream">American Dream</a> and try his luck in the <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">US</a>. He got accepted as an instructor at a summer camp north of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> in 1986, but left off for <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> soon after the camp was over.

Fashion career.
Shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles, Walker stumbled into the fashion scene by accident. Having resewn a pair of $10 pants to make them fit, he was approached by <a href="Taime%20Downe">Taime Downe</a> of <a href="glam%20metal">glam metal</a> band <a href="Faster%20Pussycat">Faster Pussycat</a>. He sold him 8 pairs of his customized pants for $25 each and soon after established a <a href="Market%20stall">stall</a> on <a href="Venice%20Beach">Venice Beach</a>, where would sell customized clothing he revamped from cheap clothes he bought at <a href="flea%20market">flea market</a>s or <a href="second%20hand%20store">second hand store</a>s. Soon, he was earning $2000 a weekend. By the early 90s, his brand, now dubbed Serious Clothing, was a multi-million dollar business venture, and was worn by the likes of <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, <a href="Alice%20Cooper">Alice Cooper</a>, and <a href="Bruce%20Willis">Bruce Willis</a>. To accomodate his company's growth, which was now being sold at retailers worldwide, he bought a huge but run-down factory building in the <a href="Arts%20District%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Arts District</a> of Los Angeles. This accidently established a second venture, as when interest in his person grew, he was approached whether he would rent parts of his property as filming locations. Bruce Willis, <a href="Victoria%20Beckham">Victoria Beckham</a>, <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>, and <a href="Prince%20%28artist%29">Prince</a>, among others, have filmed <a href="advert">advert</a>s, <a href="film">film</a>s or <a href="music%20video">music video</a>s on his company grounds. After about 15 years of manufacturing clothes, the sales of Serious Clothing began to dwindle, and Walker and his wife no longer felt connected to the scene, so they sold their business and the company eventually closed. On June 1, 2017, Walker published his <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> "Urban Outlaw: Dirt Don't Slow You Down", detailing his rise and fall in the fashion industry.

Car collection and Porsche scene career.
With his fashion business soaring, Walker was finally able to fulfill his childhood dream of buying a Porsche when he bought a 1974 <a href="Porsche%20911">Porsche 911</a> in 1992. He started to collect more and more cars and joined the <a href="Porsche%20Club%20of%20America">Porsche Club of America</a> in 2002, to find a more suitable outlet for his love for speed, which resulted in various speeding tickets. He started participating in race events after obtaining a clubsport license and began so involved in racing that he lost all fun in the sport. Consequently, he sold all cars of his that weren't Porsches and instead focused his efforts on completing his collection of vintage 911s. At a later point, he sold some of his over 40 Porsches and now holds a customized collection of 25 cars worth approximatley $7,5 million, which are not for sale. He however sells, merchandise and offers <a href="car%20tuning">customization</a> services under his own imprint, Urban Outlaw. Having a background in fashion design, he did not conform to the unwritten rules of <a href="preservation%20and%20restoration%20of%20automobiles">vintage car restoration</a> and strived to turn every car he owned into a unique piece of art without comprimising its Porsche roots. Due to this and his edgy appearence unusual for a Porsche enthusiast , his initially strictly private car collection soon attracted public attention. In 2012, Walker was approached by advertisement <a href="director">director</a> Tamir Moscovici, who intended to film a documentary about him and his car collection. The resulting <a href="short%20film">short film</a>, "Urban Outlaw", was shown at the <a href="2013%20Sundance%20Film%20Festival">2013</a> <a href="Sundance%20Festival">Sundance Festival</a> to "rave reviews" and suddently turned Walker into a public phenomenon for the custom car scene and he was featured in mutiple <a href="automobile%20magazine">automobile magazine</a>s and invited to events. His newfound fame led to Porsche, 35 after he wrote a letter of application as a child, to reach out to him. He has since featured in several Porsche adverts and acts as a <a href="spokesperson">spokesperson</a> for the brand. Furthermore, he appeared in several other documentaries, such as "I am Steve McQueen" (2014) and "Motor City Outlaw" (2016) and <a href="TV%20shows">TV shows</a>, such as "How I Rock It" (2013), "<a href="The%20Joe%20Rogan%20Experience">The Joe Rogan Experience</a>" (2015), and "<a href="Jay%20Leno%27s%20Garage">Jay Leno's Garage</a>" (2017), mostly centering on his role as a Porsche collector and customizer. In 2015, he was featured in the <a href="video%20game">video game</a> "<a href="Need%20for%20Speed%20%282015%20video%20game%29">Need for Speed</a>", as one of the icons the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> and his crew seek to impress.

Personal life.
Walker was married to his wife of 21 years, Karen, who passed away in 2015. She along with him designed for and managed Serious Clothing had the idea of buying the property that would turn into his film venture.

Tuangru (company)

Tuangru ("Formerly known as J2R Partners Inc."), derived from the Mandarin word "<a href="Group%20buying">Tuan Gou</a>" which means ""team buying"", started in 2013 as a group buying service for <a href="data%20center">data center</a> assets like <a href="servers">servers</a>, <a href="storage%20devices">storage devices</a> and network gear. The company aggregated the demand of their small to midsize clients, predominantly hosting service providers, to earn higher volume discounts from their vendor partners like <a href="Dell">Dell</a> and Super Micro, and pass those additional savings back to clients.

Two of the founders, Jad Jebara and Rajan Sodhi, came from "Peer 1 Hosting" (now <a href="Cogeco%20Peer%201">Cogeco Peer 1</a>) where they served as executives that helped grow the company from a market cap of approximately $35M to $635M CDN (the price at which it was acquired by <a href="Cogeco">Cogeco Cable</a> in 2013). During that time, they understood the significant costs in operating a data center and the lack of tools to significantly reduce costs and increase IT efficiencies. Together, with Rami Jebara and Risto Ylivainio, they founded Tuangru to develop a <a href="data%20center">data center</a> management software platform that would address these challenges. 

History.
Tuangru started out as a group buying service for data center assets like servers, storage devices and network gear. The company aggregated the demand of their small to midsize clients, predominantly hosting service providers, to earn higher volume discounts from their vendor partners like Dell and Super Micro, and pass those additional savings back to clients. The company developed an online procurement platform that enabled their clients to procure these assets directly. Features included a smart configurator, role-based logins, multi-company accounts, approval routing, budget limits, lease management, warranty management, spend graphs, and reporting tools.

The company has since re-positioned itself as a next-generation data center management software provider that allows data center operators to procure, deploy, monitor and measure all of their IT assets through the Tuangru platform.

[edit source]

Drawing Tools.
All drawing tools you need are surprisingly simple. One of the best things on drawing is that you can start right away with inconsiderable investment.
I took some photos of the drawing tools that I use for drawings on my website. Since I currently live in Japan, I have available only Japanese drawing instruments and I can tell you they are fantastic.

These products are manufactured with such delicacy and sense for details. All I can say is that Japanese stationary products are one of the highest qualities in the world, if not the highest and, this is not an exaggeration.

If you have a possibility to buy yourself good Japanese stationery, do it. You will not regret.

What Drawing Tools Do I Need?

1. Sketch Book or Drawing Book
If you are only exercising choose the simplest and cheapest sketch book for children. It is usually available in many formats. I would recommend starting from B4 format because you can make many drawings, sketches and studies on one single page.
If you do not have any sketch book available, you can also draw on the back of an envelope.

For practicing it really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that you draw and thus train your brain to function in relaxed mood.

Tracing Paper
Tracing paper is mostly used in technical drawing and architecture but you will find it very useful if you want to make an exact copy of a picture.

The A4 size of tracing paper will be excellent for your drawing and sketching work. I can tell you, that working by tracing paper is an excellent exercise to catch the shape of the picture.

If you do not have tracing paper available at hand, put the picture you are going to trace on the window in your room, fix it by tape on each corner so that it won’t move and place the blank white paper over it, also fixing the blank paper by tape on corners.

The picture will reflect from the bottom up and you can trace the picture on the blank paper. Since this requires you to work in standing position on the vertical flat surface, you may feel slight tiredness in your arms. In such case just stop drawing for a while, relax and continue later.

Working with tracing techniques is very helpful, because often you need only to grab the outlines of the drawing, by other word to get the correct shape and the rest is only a kind of coloring page work.

Every successful drawing is about being able to catch the correct shape of the object. By tracing you can do it absolutely effortlessly while learning and practicing.

I would like to make one point clear here and, that is: Tracing is never cheating! Be easy about it. Yes, tracing paper is also one of the excellent drawing tools – instruments.

2. HB Pencil
HB pencil is probably the most popular hardness of a pencil, because it is neither too soft nor too hard. It allows you to draw a large variety of pencil drawings and sketches and, is excellent for shading.

3. 0,5mm HB Sharp Pencil
A sharp pencil is one of an indispensable drawing tools used in technical drawing and architecture. But it is also very useful in artistic drawing. The biggest advantage is that you do not need to sharpen it. Refills are very cheap too.
Things to be careful while choosing your sharp pencil is, to select the light one with plastic body. There are sharp pencils with metallic made body and (in my opinion) they are a bit heavy for artistic drawing. You need a light pencil in your hand not a heavy piece of metal stick.

Different case is if you would use it for technical drawing. There, it is quite helpful because you draw only by ruler and the weight of the pencil helps you to stabilize your hand.

4. Pen Shaped Eraser
I am not sure if the “Pen-Shaped-Eraser” is the correct name for this thing, but the picture tells you what I mean. Among many types and shapes of erasers choose for your drawings and sketches something like this. It is tremendously helpful, because the size of the eraser is always slim and that is what you need almost always.
In your drawings or sketches you often need to erase narrow parts on the drawing so that you won’t damage or blur the good part. It is very difficult to do it with the traditional piece of eraser. So, in order to make your drawing work easy it is better to have one like this.

Eraser is also an excellent drawing tool. It is just this type of eraser by which you will be able to highlight the bright spots on your drawings easily. You can “draw by eraser” the shining parts in human hair or animal’s fur; it is tremendously useful when you draw grass or other plants.
Faces Simple Pencil Sketches[edit source]
1. KNOW YOUR PROPORTIONS.

Heads are not perfect circles, and they are not perfect ovals either. You can think of them as kind of egg-shaped, with the tapered end toward the bottom. Of course, this varies depending on the actual person and the angle you are seeing them from. But let’s start with an egg…

draw a head

2. REFINE THE JAWLINE.

If you are drawing a woman, this egg shape might do well to describe her jawline, but let’s say we’re drawing a man with a slightly more angular jaw and flatter chin. Let’s bring the jawline out.

jawline

3. WHERE TO PLACE THE EYES?

Well, we have a tendency to think the eyes are closer to the top of the head than the bottom because they are the highest facial feature. But that’s not really the case.

add eyes

As you can see, the eyes are just about halfway between the bottom of the jaw and the top of the head. There is a lot of head above the eyes, as any of us with a receding hairline know. But I skipped a step here — how far apart should the eyes be? How big should they be?

4. A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS THAT THE HEAD IS ABOUT 5 EYES WIDE.

That means the gap between the eyes where the bridge of the nose is located is about the same width as the face on either side of the eyes. Like any rule of thumb, it’s important to remember this isn’t always the case, and that this applies only to drawing the face head-on in a portrait.

wide eyes

5. NOW LET’S PLACE THE EARS.

Locate the tops just above the eyes, and bring them down to a point almost halfway from the eyes to the bottom of the jaw. Depending on the person, the ears can stick out a lot or a little, so there’s not a good rule for that other than careful observation.

Well, what do you know — after drawing the ears, you now have a great idea about where to locate the nose!

ears

6. ADD THE NOSE.

Noses do vary quite a bit in width, so keep that in mind. The sides of this guy’s nose extend a little past the inside corners of his eyes.

nose

7. THE MOUTH IS A BIT TRICKIER.

Rather than the mouth itself being halfway from the earlobes to the jawline, use that halfway point for the bottom lip. The width of the corners of the mouth often extends to about the location of the iris in the eyes above.

mouth

8. EYEBROW PLACEMENT.

This is another feature that varies greatly from person to person. Do keep in mind that each eyebrow is generally wider than the eye below it. They also tend to be thickest toward the bridge of the nose and taper toward the sides of the face, where they often also sweep downward.

eyebrows

9. DON’T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF PLACING THE HAIR ON THE VERY TOP OF THE HEAD!

The hairline is typically about a quarter to a third of the way from the top of the head to the eyebrows. Or in Sir Patrick Stewart’s case, behind the top of the head.

hair

These proportions work just as easily for a woman. Adjust the jawline to be a little more rounded, make the ears a bit smaller and the neck a little narrower and you have a pretty convincing female face.

face

The other cool thing about knowing your proportions is you can use them to draw a head in profile, too! Just extend your proportion lines across and you have a great way to keep your head proportions consistent.

Battle of Stalc

The Battle of Stalc was a <a href="Scottish%20clan">Scottish clan</a> battle that was fought in the year 1468. It was fought between the forces of the <a href="Clan%20Stewart%20of%20Appin">Clan Stewart of Appin</a> and their allies the <a href="Clan%20MacLaren">Clan MacLaren</a> against the <a href="Clan%20MacDougall">Clan MacDougall</a> and the <a href="Clan%20MacFarlane">Clan MacFarlane</a>. The latter force may have included men from the <a href="Clan%20Campbell">Clan Campbell</a>.

Background.
In 1463 John Stewart, <a href="Lord%20of%20Lorne">Lord of Lorne</a> was murdered at <a href="Dunstaffnage%20Castle">Dunstaffnage Castle</a> by Alan MacCaul, or MacDougall, and his supporters. As a result the right of John Stewart's son, Dugald Stewart, to succeed was disputed. Over the next few years Dugald lost the title of Lord of Lorne through the treachery of his uncle Walter Stewart and also the Lord of Argyll. However, he had retained <a href="Appin">Appin</a> and <a href="Lismore%2C%20Scotland">Lismore</a>, and consolidated his power and fortified the hunting lodge which later became <a href="Castle%20Stalker">Castle Stalker</a> on the Cormorant's Rock in Loch Liach. His clan also kept up regular raids on the Campbell territory that surrounded Appin.

Battle.
In 1468 the feud culminated in the bloody Battle of Stalc. Colin Campbell and Walter Stewart had organized a massive raid against Dugald Stewart and his clan. Alan MacCaul (or MacDougall) was also involved. Dugald Stewart gathered his men and as the enemy approached he sent his men out along a ridge which gave him the advantage of ground. Although Dugald lost many men he virtually destroyed the military strength of the MacFarlanes, which they never recovered from. Alan MacDougall, or MacCaul, murderer of John Stewart was killed in the battle, apparently by Dugald himself. However, according to 21st century historian Walter MacDougall it is not entirely clear what happened to Alan MacCaul (MacCoul), but if he did die in the battle that the <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> name of the place where the fight took place, "Lagna an Phail", which translates as "treacherous hollow", was a fitting place for his final moments.

Australian Institute of Fitness

The Australian Institute of Fitness is a privately owned, registered training organisation, and the largest fitness training organisation in Australia. Beginning operations as the Health Studio Attendants course in Perth in 1979, the Institute became Australia’s first national fitness training provider in 2000, with the merger of five state-based fitness training programs.

History.
In 1979, sports educator and author Nigel Champion began running a Health Studio Attendants course in Perth, the first of its kind in Australia. In 1981, Champion partnered with Australian academic Dr Garry Egger to establish the ACHPER Fitness Leader group of courses in Sydney; before joining, in 1986, with fitness entrepreneur Greg Hurst to establish the Australian Fitness Network. In 2000, Hurst & Champion together with Russell Creagh, Monty Dortkamp, Dr Grant Pavia and Kerry McEvoy, merged five existing fitness training programs – ACHPER Fitness Leader; Australian Fitness Network; Institute for Fitness Professionals; National College of Fitness; and the Australian Institute of Fitness – to create the national Australian Institute of Fitness.

Russell Creagh served as the first CEO of the consolidated Institute, from 2001 to 2006, followed by Greg Hurst (2006 – 2011) and Dyanne Ward (2011 – 2016). In December 2016, Steve Pettit, the Institute’s CEO Queensland, was appointed as its National Chief Executive on the retirement of Dyanne Ward.

Since inception, the founding entities provided a variety of fitness industry-specific certification and training courses. Following the Federal Government’s 1996 training reform agenda, these courses were incorporated into the <a href="Australian%20Qualifications%20Framework">Australian Qualifications Framework</a> (AQF). Since 1996, the Institute has delivered nationally recognised qualifications in fitness, massage and business, in compliance with the regulatory standards of the AQF.

Reviews:.
Msenwa's story shook me from the inside.  He has given a voice to the millions who haven't had the opportunity to tell their own story of courage and survival. His descriptions of carefree pre-war village life makes me ache for the people of DR Congo and mourn their lost way of life.  The word "Refugee" sounds and looks different to me now.  This book changed me. --Heather Haynes Artist and founder of Worlds Collide Africa

A must read book that inspires hope. - Rev Simon Weston Wachu,  Shelter Worship Centre, Kenya

The truly unusual aspect of the story is the thread of the author's amazing self-awareness at each step.  There are priceless insights here for many people. - Gerald E Bates, PhD, Chairman of Board of Directors Friends of Hope Africa University.

Like stories in the Bible, God gives us a wonderful gift in weaving a gripping story through Msenwa. It is a gift that none of us would want to live but endears us to the one who did. To share in that blessing, read on. - Paul Stevenson, PhD Assistant Professor of Psychology, Roberts Wesleyan College

Battle of Thannuris

The Battle of Thannuris was fought between the forces of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire</a> under <a href="Belisarius">Belisarius</a> and <a href="Coutzes">Coutzes</a> and the persian <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid (Persian) Empire</a> under <a href="Xerxes%20%28Sasanian%20prince%29">Xerxes</a> in summer 528, near <a href="Dara%20%28Mesopotamia%29">Dara</a> in northern <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. As they were trying to build a fortress in Minduous, the Byzantines were defeated by the Sasasian army. <a href="Belisarius">Belisarius</a> managed to flee but the Sassanids destroyed the buildings. Despite their victory, the Persians suffered heavy losses, making the Sasanian king of Persia <a href="Kavadh%20I">Kavadh I</a> angry. Shortly after the battle,the general <a href="Xerxes%20%28Sasanian%20prince%29">Xerxes</a> is disgraced by <a href="Kavadh%20I">Kavadh I</a>.

Background.
After the death of the emperor <a href="Justin%20I">Justin I</a> in 527, his successor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> was determined to continue the war against the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a>. He appointed <a href="Belisarius">Belisarius</a> as "<a href="magister%20militum">magister militum</a>" of the East and put him in charge of strengthening the byzantine positions and building a new fortress near Dara to protect the region of persian raids. Thannuris seemed to be a convenient place for a city and a military force to be stationed but the current fort was vulnerable. He began firstly by overseeing the strengthening of the fortifications.

Battle.
At the same time, a persian army under the prince Xerxes with 30 000 men invaded Mesopotamia. Perceiving the threat, other byzantine units and <a href="Ghassanids">ghassanid</a> allies joined the forces of <a href="Belisarius">Belisarius</a> to protect Roman workers undertaking the construction of the fort.

As the building operations were progressing, the persian army arised. Despit the byzantine efforts, the persians managed to close the wall and breach them. <a href="Belisarius">Belisarius</a> tried to counterattack with his cavalary but was defeated and ordered to withdraw to Dara. 

The end of the battle was disastrous for the byzantine army. Belisarius managed to escape but 2 commanders were killed and three captured. 

<a href="Jabalah%20IV%20ibn%20al-Harith">Jabalah IV ibn al-Harith</a>, ruler of the <a href="Ghassanids">Ghassanids</a>, who fought under the Belisarius' command as Byzantine vassal, fall from his horse and is killed by the Persians.

Coutzes's fate is uncertain. Procopius writes that he was taken prisoner and never seen again, while Zacharias of Mytilene records that he was killed.

Aftermath.
After the battle, the foundations of the new fortress were left in the hands of the Persians which began to destroy them. The Byzantine army retreated to Dara, but some of the infantry died of thirst on the march.

Despite their victory, the Persians suffered heavily losses and then retreated beyond the frontier. The loss of 500 <a href="Immortals%20%28Achaemenid%20Empire%29">Immortals</a> from the <a href="Imperial%20Guard">Imperial Guard</a>, in particular, made the king of Persia <a href="Kavadh%20I">Kavadh I</a> angry. Despite his victory, the general <a href="Xerxes%20%28Sasanian%20prince%29">Xerxes</a> is disgraced shortly after the battle by <a href="Kavadh%20I">Kavadh I</a>.

The byzantine emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian</a> sent additional troops to reinforce the border fortress of Amida, Constantia, Edessa, Sura and Beroea. He raised also a new army which was placed under the command of Pompeius, but a severe winter interrupted the operations until the end of the year.

Caroline Augusta Huling

Caroline Augusta Alden Huling (April 2, 1856 - 1941) was a journalist, philanthropist, editor, publisher and reformer.

Early life and family.
Caroline Augusta Alden Huling was born in <a href="Saratoga%20Springs%2C%20New%20York">Saratoga Springs, New York</a>, in April 2, 1856. Her father, Edmund James Huling (1820-1891), was a native of that county, and was an editor and publisher in Saratoga Springs for a half-century. He was very public-spirited and liberal in his views, and his daughter owed much to the sympathy and encouragement of both parents. Her mother, Anna Rebecca Spooner (1822-1891), was the daughter of Col. Alden Spooner of <a href="Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York">Brooklyn, New York</a>, in which city Mrs. Huling was born and educated. Alden Spooner was also an editor and publisher, as were his ancestors before him. Mrs. Huling's family took high rank in literature and numbered on its roll several who won fame with pen and voice. Among them were "Fanny Fern" (Sara Willis), <a href="Nathaniel%20Parker%20Willis">Nathaniel Parker Willis</a>, and the brothers Prime(<a href="Samuel%20I.%20Prime">Samuel I. Prime</a>, <a href="Edward%20Dorr%20Griffin%20Prime">Edward Dorr Griffin Prime</a> and <a href="William%20Cowper%20Prime">William Cowper Prime</a>), so long connected with the New York "Observer", who were her cousins. Both parents of Caroline Augusta Huling traced their ancestry back to the earliest days of the country. The published record of her mother's family proves her direct descent from <a href="John%20Alden">John Alden</a> and <a href="Priscilla%20Alden">Priscilla Alden</a> (ascending line: Alden Spooner , Judah Paddock Spooner , Rebecca Paddock , Alice Alden , David , John), made famous by <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>. 

In accordance with Edmund J. Huling's commonsense views, Caroline Augusta Huling was educated in the public schools, leaving the classrooms behind her, while in the last year prior to graduation from the village high school. Music, languages and the best periodicals of the day were studied after that date. 
Career.
Caroline Augusta Huling chose journalism as her profession. Under the tuition of her father she began active work when but twelve years old, starting with society reporting in the ballrooms of Saratoga Springs. Later on, sermons and conventions were entrusted to her. 
For several years Huling followed the usual routine of most young women, entering society and taking an active interest in temperance and church work. She became a <a href="International%20Organisation%20of%20Good%20Templars">Good Templar</a> in 1874 and held her membership continuously until the end of the XIX century. She was prominent in the work and held several offices in the lodges. When the <a href="Woman%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union">Woman's Christian Temperance Union</a> was organized, she was one of the first to don the white ribbon. She was one of the first executive board of the <a href="Humane%20society">Humane society</a> and secretary of the local <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">Woman Suffrage Society</a>. Much inspiration to greater efforts in the latter line was derived from frequent visits to Boston, where she mingled with those of similar tastes and studied the methods which they favored. 

Huling was especially trained as a teacher and expected to follow that profession, but the ill-health of both her parents prevented, and, becoming tired of what seemed an idle life, she begged to enter business, and was duly installed associate editor of the Saratoga "Sentinel" with her father, and became his right-hand in all business matters, having special superintendence of his book-bindery. She was also correspondent of many city papers. President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, then Governor of New York and with whom her family had political connections, made her a notary public, the first woman in New York to be appointed a notary public. 

Huling was for two years secretary of the Cook County Equal Suffrage Association, for two years superintendent of press work of the State society, and for one year county organizer. In 1884 she went to Chicago to attend the national suffrage convention and decided to move permanently and try to self-support herself as journalist and devoting most of her time to the cause of woman's enfranchisement. 

She became an associate editor of a trade journal in Chicago answering a want ad as "C. A. Huling", to avoid being identified as a woman.
In 1885 Huling was a founding member of the <a href="Illinois%20Woman%27s%20Press%20Association">Illinois Woman's Press Association</a> (IWPA), and for several years she was one of its executive board. In 1890 she represented the association in the <a href="National%20Newspaper%20Association">National Newspaper Association</a>, and was unanimously elected assistant recording secretary of that body, the first woman elected to office. 

Huling took great interest in the formation of the Illinois Woman's Alliance, in October 1888, and was elected president, serving two-years without opposition, and declining election the third year in order to devote herself to a working-woman's club, of which she was also president. 
From October 1887 to November 1888, Huling edited and published an eight-page semi-monthly periodical called "Justitia, a Court for the Unrepresented", in which she had a small pecuniary interest. It was the organ of the Illinois Equal Suffrage Association, and devoted to the advancement of women, social purity and other reforms. Owing to differences of opinion regarding its editorial policy, "Justitia" was discontinued at the close of its first volume. 
Huling was well and favorably known as a speaker, possessing a clear, distinct voice and an unconventional manner. In 1884 she made several addresses for the Prohibition party and exerted her personal influence in the lodge-room and elsewhere for that party. She was known as a superior parliamentarian. When very young, she became a member of the Episcopal Church. For many years she was very devoted to that form of faith, but at the end of the 19th century she adopted the liberal tendencies of her father and became broadly undenominational, though still retaining a respect for the church in which she was reared and a nominal membership therein. 
Much of Huling's work with the pen was in the line of unsigned editorial and special articles. She had a taste for fiction and more purely literary work, and aspired to achieve success in that line, publishing a number of short stories. She especially delighted in news-editorial work, and was peculiarly fitted for it. 
In March 1888, Huling attended the <a href="International%20Council%20of%20Women">International Council of Women</a> conference in Washington, D.C., and was a link between Chicago and the women's movement internationally. 
In the fall of 1891 Huling aided in the organization of the Woman's Baking Company, and became its secretary. The philanthropic features of the plan appealed to her sympathies, and she relinquished her professional work in a great measure to aid her sisters, the company aiming to provide a good investment for small savings and an avenue of employment for many women.
Huling published "The Bookseller" and edited many newsletters such as "Social Progress", "The Stylus", and "The Sentinel". She was the author of the novels, "The Courage of Her Convictions" (1896) and "Letters of a Business Woman to Her Niece". In "The Courage of Her Convictions" the heroine, wanting a child, is artificially inseminated since she is disillusioned by men. In the end she marries her doctor, who is the father of the baby, realizing her child needs both parents.

In 1912 Huling founded the Midwest chapter of Alden Kindred of America. 

Huling was an active member of many other societies as well, like the <a href="Daughters%20of%20the%20American%20Revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a>, the <a href="The%20Huguenot%20Society%20of%20America">Hugenot Society</a> of Pennsylvania, the Institute of American Genealogy, the <a href="Chicago%20Woman%27s%20Club">Woman's City Club of Chicago</a>, and the <a href="Society%20of%20Midland%20Authors">Society of Midland Authors</a>.

Personal life.
Both Huling's parents died in 1890. All of their nine living children were more or less connected with newspaper work, and were authors. All were married excepting Huling. 

They were: 
Maria Smith Huling (1843-1918, married George Oberne (1843-1911)),

Battle of Strasbourg (506)

The Battle of Strasbourg () in A.D. 506 is a battle that several researchers have postulated was the third battle presumed to have taken place between the <a href="Alamanni">Alamanni</a> and the <a href="Franks">Franks</a> and which resulted in the defeat and incorporation of the northern Alamanni into the Frankish Empire, whilst the southern Alamanni placed themselves under the protection of the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogothic</a> king, <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric the Great</a>.

Historical sources.
The historical sources only make indirect references to a possible third battle between the Alamanni and the Franks. A letter by Theodoric the Great dating to 506/7 to the <a href="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> king, <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis I</a>, speaks of battles in which Clovis had engaged the Alamanni. In this lettwer, Theodoric calls upon his brother-in-law to moderate his anger against the Alamanni, to punish only those who were disloyal and to cease from fighting the rest of the Alamanni. Theodoric placed the latter under his personal protection. A <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a> by <a href="Magnus%20Felix%20Ennodius">Ennodius</a> about Theodoric the Great speaks exaggeratedly of a victory by Theodoric over the Alamanni.

Historical background.
At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tolbiac">Battle of Tolbiac</a> in A.D. 496 the Alamanni suffered a severe defeat at the hands of Clovis. As a consequences, some of the Alamanni appear to have come under the protection of the <a href="Merovingians">Merovingians</a>. From Theodoric's letter it may be assumed that these Alamanni subsequently broke their treaty with Clovis and for that reason they were persecuted and there were further battles between Clovis and the Alamanni. Several researchers believe that in A.D. 506 a third battled took place between the Alamanni and the Franks, although the sources do not give any dates. What is certain is that between 496 and 506 there were further clashes. The location of the battle is not mentioned anywhere; that it was explicitly near Strasbourg, remains a theory held by a number of scholars.

Outcome.
Loss of territory.
A consequence of losing the conflict between 496 and 506 against the Franks was that the territory that had been settled by the northern Alamanni, probably up to the present dialect boundary between the <a href="Alemannic%20dialects">Alemannic</a> and <a href="South%20Franconian%20German">South Franconian</a> dialects, finally came under Frankish rule.

The supporters of Shkëndija are called the "Ballistët", named after the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> <a href="Balli%20Komb%C3%ABtar">Balli Kombëtar</a>. When the club was formed in 1979, use of nationalism was strictly prohibited by the <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>n government. The supporting firm of Shkëndija called themselves BAL, using the first three letters of Balli Kombëtar. When Shkëndija was reinstated into the <a href="First%20Macedonian%20Football%20League">Macedonian Football League</a>, the supporting firm was re-established as the "Ballistët" in 1992. When kick-off commences, The Ballistët always sing the national anthem of Albania. In Tetovo, the group has been responsible for the desecration of the monument to the fallen partisans in the national-liberation struggle. They graffiti "Ballistet Shkëndija" and "1992 Ultras". This occurred ten days after the <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28Republic%20of%20Macedonia%29">Macedonian independence</a> day.

The "Ballistët" are one of the most notorious football supporter groups in <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a>. Their antics are occasionally reported on the news. On 18 October 2010, Shkëndija played against <a href="FK%20Napredok">FK Napredok</a> away in <a href="Kicevo">Kicevo</a>. The Ballist removed the <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonian</a> flag from the mast and put an <a href="Albania">Albania</a>n flag in its place. As the police tried to put the Macedonian flag up again, the Ballist tore out their seats and threw them at the police.

Fans of opposing clubs barely go to <a href="Ecolog%20Arena">Ecolog Arena</a> as the ""Ballistet"" are one of the largest firms in <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a>. This was noted when <a href="FK%20Rabotni%C4%8Dki">FK Rabotnički</a> played Shkëndija in 2008. Rabotnicki had the lead over Shkëndija in Tetovo with the score 0:1. A loss would have meant relegation into the second division. At half time, Rabotnicki's players and coaches were attacked when they were leaving the pitch. Rabotnicki supporters and police could not stop the large presence of Shkëndija supporters, resulting in the match to be abandoned and Shkëndija being relegated to the second league.

On 3 August 2010, during a heated match with city rivals Teteks, the majority of the supporters of Teteks, the Vojvodi, abandoned their team in the 78th minute and left the stadium to avoid clashing with the Shkëndija supporters after the game. Those that remained for the whole game had to remain in the stadium as the Ballistët were outside the stadium waiting for them. A heavy police presence escorted the Teteks supporters out of the stadium.

On 11 September 2011, the Shkendija supporters attacked fans and players of <a href="FK%20Ohrid">FK Ohrid</a> at half time. This resulted in Shkendija supporters being suspended for two home matches.

After <a href="Partizan%20Belgrade">Partizan Belgrade</a> defeated Shkëndija in <a href="Skopje">Skopje</a> for the qualifying rounds of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2011–12 UEFA Champions League</a>, Partizan coach <a href="Aleksandar%20Stanojevic">Aleksandar Stanojevic</a> stated that Shkëndija out played Partizan in the first half due to the great atmosphere of the Shkëndija supporters intimidating the Partizan players. In the match, the Albanian flag covered the entire west end of the stadium, along with banners such as ""Ballistet"", ""1st state <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, 2nd state <a href="Kosovo">Kosova</a>, 3rd state coming soon"" and ""<a href="1999%20NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia">24 March 1999</a>"".<ref name="Ž. Babovic / D. Nikolić"></ref> The Ballistet chanted notable remarks such as, "Ubi ubi srbina" (Kill the Serbs)
, <a href="Adem%20Jashari">Adem Jashari</a>, <a href="Kosovo%20Liberation%20Army">UÇK</a>, Republic of Kosovo and singing Albanian nationalist songs.

On 10 March 2012, two Shkëndija supporters were arrested after a policeman was stabbed while apparently protecting two men from a mob attack. The cause of this was retaliation for the killing of two ethnic Albanians by an off-duty police officer in the town of Gostivar. After the arrests, hardcore Shkendija fans, the Ballistët, threatened to cause trouble in a match against league leaders Vardar Skopje originally scheduled for Wednesday, which had been suspended and played on another date with no fans being allowed to attend.

In May 2012, a delegation of the Ballistët ultras travelled to neighbouring Kosovo to pay their respects at a shrine to <a href="Adem%20Jashari">Adem Jashari</a>, one of the founders of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
On 4 May 2012, the Ballistët joined counter-protests in ethnic Albanian neighbourhoods for the
<a href="2012%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia%20inter-ethnic%20violence%23Albanian%20protests">inter-ethnic violence</a>.

On 23 May 2013, the <a href="Macedonian%20Cup">Macedonian Cup</a> final was abandoned late on Wednesday between Shkëndija and Teteks. The match was abandoned after 20 minutes for fear that the chants might ignite violence. The Shkëndija supporters booed the Macedonian national anthem, threw flares at the police and security as well as chanting "Ballisti Zakon", "UÇK" and other nationalistic rhetoric. Also and Macedonian fans of Teteks did the same against Albanians. The match between Teteks and Shkëndija was rescheduled for Sunday and the <a href="Macedonian%20Football%20Federation">Macedonian Football Federation</a> said it would be played in an empty stadium to avoid provocation.

After Shkëndija's 5–0 victory over Teteks, Shkëlzen Meta, the leading captain of the Ballistët, handed over the reins to the young Isak Luma.

On 19 October 2014, during the rivalry match against FK Vardar, The Ballistët held a large banner stating ""They are cancer of Europe  – UEFA do you need more?!"" accompanied with a montage of pictures showing Serb hooligans involved in the Serbia vs England U-21 match, Italy vs Serbia match and the Serbia vs Albania match. The Ballistët are part of the <a href="Tifozat%20Kuq%20e%20Zi">TKZ</a> ultras group that supports Albania in international football. In the next home game against <a href="FK%20Metalurg%20Skopje">FK Metalurg</a>, the Ballistët, dissatisfied with the UEFA ruling of the <a href="Serbia%20v%20Albania%20%28UEFA%20Euro%202016%20qualifying%29">cancelled Serbia vs Albania match</a>, held banners stating ""Dear <a href="Michel%20Platini">Platinovic</a>, They beat our players and won 3:0! We kill them in the return match and we get <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202016">EURO 16</a> final spot??"" along with chants against UEFA and Michel Platini.

On 7 April 2015, Shkëndija were fined by the FFM and supporters banned due to politically motivated banners and chants, as well as the assault on FK Tetek's manager <a href="Gorazd%20Mihajlov">Gorazd Mihajlov</a>. A banner with a picture of Milenko Nedelkovski and an <a href="Orangutan">Orangutan</a> were held up with a caption stating, ""is there a difference?"". The Ballistët have sent a letter to the FFM stating that the banner was in retaliation for Nedelkovski's offensive remarks about Albanians. Milenko Nedelkovski runs a talk show on Macedonia state television and is a fervent supporter of <a href="VMRO-DPMNE">VMRO-DPMNE</a>.

On the morning of the 23 February 2016, two buses of <a href="Buducnost%20Podgorica">Buducnost Podgorica</a> supporters, Varvari Podgorica, travelled to Skopje to attend a match. On the road to Skopje, Shkendija supporters, Ballistët, came across the supporters while heading towards the match between Shkendija and Turnovo on the bridge. The Shkendija supporters initiated clashes on the road, resulting in damaging the buses and injuring ten Buducnost fans, sending two to hospital with serious injuries.

Notable fans.
Shkëndija's main supporters are Albanians from Tetovo, greater Albania regions and Albanian diaspora. Some notable fans include politicians <a href="Shpend%20Ahmeti">Shpend Ahmeti</a> and <a href="Albin%20Kurti">Albin Kurti</a>, actors Xhevdet Jashari and <a href="Blerim%20Destani">Blerim Destani</a>, singers Shkumbin Ismaili and Arif Ziberi of <a href="Elita%205">Elita 5</a> and athletes <a href="Lorik%20Cana">Lorik Cana</a>, <a href="Blerim%20Dzemaili">Blerim Dzemaili</a> and <a href="Xherdan%20Shaqiri">Xherdan Shaqiri</a>

Metropolis of Ioannina

The Metropolis of Ioannina (, "Iera Mitropolis Ioanninon") is a <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox</a> <a href="diocese">diocese</a> centred on the city of <a href="Ioannina">Ioannina</a>, in the <a href="Epirus%20%28region%29">Epirus</a> of <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. As one of the "New Lands", it belongs formally to the <a href="Patriarchate%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarchate of Constantinople</a>, but is administered by the <a href="Church%20of%20Greece">Church of Greece</a>. , the Metropolitan of Ioannina is <a href="Maximos%20Papagiannis">Maximos Papagiannis</a>.

History.
The exact time of Ioannina's foundation is unknown. It is commonly identified with an unnamed new, "well-fortified" city, recorded by the historian <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a> ("De Aedificiis", IV.1.39–42) as having been built by the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> () for the inhabitants of ancient <a href="Euroia">Euroia</a>, but archaological evidence for this is lacking; indeed, early 21st-century excavations have brought to light fortifications dating to the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> (4th–3rd centuries BC), the course of which was largely followed by the later <a href="Castle%20of%20Ioannina">Castle of Ioannina</a>. 

The name Ioannina appears for the first time in 879, in the acts of the <a href="Fourth%20Council%20of%20Constantinople%20%28Eastern%20Orthodox%29">Fourth Council of Constantinople</a>, which refer to one Zacharias, Bishop of Ioannine, a <a href="suffragan">suffragan</a> of <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Naupaktos">Naupaktos</a>. After the <a href="Byzantine%20conquest%20of%20Bulgaria">Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria</a>, in 1020 Emperor <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> () subordinated the local bishopric to the <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Ohrid">Archbishopric of Ohrid</a>. In the <a href="Partitio%20Romaniae">treaty of partition</a> of the Byzantine lands after the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a>, Ioannina was promised to the Venetians, but in the event, it became part of the new <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">state of Epirus</a>, founded by <a href="Michael%20I%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Michael I Komnenos Doukas</a>. 

Following the assassination of the last native ruler, <a href="Thomas%20I%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Thomas I Komnenos Doukas</a> by his nephew, <a href="Nicholas%20Orsini">Nicholas Orsini</a>, in 1318, the city refused to accept the latter and turned to the Byzantines for assistance. On this occasion, Emperor <a href="Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos">Andronikos II Palaiologos</a> () elevated the city to a <a href="metropolitan%20bishopric">metropolitan bishopric</a>, and in 1319 Andronikos II issued a chrysobull conceding wide-ranging autonomy and various privileges and exemptions on its inhabitants. The new metropolis was placed in 53rd place among the metropolitan sees subject to the <a href="Patriarchate%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarchate of Constantinople</a>, but rose to 42nd place under <a href="Andronikos%20III%20Palaiologos">Andronikos III Palaiologos</a> (), and further to 33rd place in . The suffragan sees of the new metropolis in the 14th century are not known, but are likely the same four sees as those attested for : the bishoprics of <a href="Vela%2C%20Epirus">Vela</a>, <a href="Dryinoupolis">Dryinoupolis</a>, <a href="Buthrotum">Bouthrotos</a>/<a href="Glyky">Glyky</a>, and <a href="Himarra">Himarra</a>.

Under the regime of <a href="Thomas%20II%20Preljubovi%C4%87">Thomas II Preljubović</a> (1367–1384), the citizens and the local Church suffered greatly: Thomas confiscated property in favour of his Serb followers, and drove the Metropolitan Sebastianos to exile; nevertheless, he was able to repel successive attempts by the Albanian chieftains <a href="Peter%20Losha">Peter Losha</a> and <a href="John%20Bua%20Spata">John Bua Spata</a> to capture the city, most notably the great surprise attack of 1379, whose failure the Ioannites attributed to intervention by their patron, Saint Michael. 

Bishops.
Apart from Bishop Zacharias in 879, no incumbent of the see is known by name prior to its raising to metropolitan status. From the 14th century, the episcopal list is as follows:

<doc id="54966408" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54966408" title="LeanXcale database">
LeanXcale database

LeanXcale is an <a href="Hybrid%20Transactional/Analytical%20Processing%20%28HTAP%29">HTAP database</a> developed by a company with the same name, LeanXcale. LeanXcale is a Full <a href="SQL">SQL</a> and Full <a href="ACID">ACID</a> <a href="distributed%20database">distributed database</a>. It supports both operational and analytical workloads. On the operational side, the main feature lies in its ability to scale transactional processing to millions of transactions per second and 100s of nodes in a linear way. On the analytical side, it has a distributed OLAP query engine that works directly on the operational data, thus delivering real-time analytics. The database provides standard SQL and a <a href="JDBC%20driver">JDBC driver</a> for applications to access it.

Architecture.
LeanXcale can be classified as a <a href="NewSQL">NewSQL</a> database. LeanXcale runs on a cluster with a <a href="shared%20nothing%20architecture">shared nothing architecture</a> and can <a href="scale%20out">scale out</a> to 100s of nodes. The database has three main components: 

Query Processing.
LeanXcale has a distributed query engine. The query engine is able to run queries in two different modes: OLTP and OLAP. In the OLTP mode the query runs on a single query engine instance. This approach is adopted for small queries to scale out to very large numbers. In the OLAP mode, the query runs in a number of query engine instances that aggregate the power of multiple nodes to answer analytical queries in online times. The query engine itself is stateless, it just has session state. Data is accessed through the KiVi storage engine.

Transactional Management.
The transactional management is based on a radically different approach. ACID properties have been decomposed and are scaled out independently but in a composable manner. Basically, the transactional management is able to commit fully in parallel all transactions without any coordination and then, it regulates the visibility of committed data so only fully consistent snapshots become visible to the applications. The transactional manager can handle 100s of millions of update transactions per second and any number of read-only transactions. 

KiVi Storage Engine.
KiVi storage engine is also a technology created by LeanXcale. KiVi is a relational and fully ACID key-value data store. Data stored in LeanXcale database can be accessed through any of the two interfaces. The traditional SQL and JDBC driver or the KiVi key-value interface. The latter has the advantage that avoids all the overhead of SQL processing and provides ultra-efficient access to the relational data. KiVi provides standard get and put methods (with a relational schema), but it also provides a scan method with predicate that is equivalent to the SQL statement SELECT with just a predicate. Inserts through the key-value interface are extremely efficient.

KiVi is based on <a href="Multiversion%20concurrency%20control">Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)</a> that is integrated with the transactional manager. Transactions in KiVi are fully distributed, that is, they can access data in any arbitrary number of nodes and tables, and rely on the LeanXcale ultra-scalable transactional manager.

KiVi exploits <a href="Vector%20processor">vectorial</a> and <a href="SIMD">SIMD</a> capabilities of current commodity CPUs like <a href="Intel">Intel</a> and <a href="Advanced%20Micro%20Devices">AMD</a>. This vectorial acceleration is used for improve the performance of searches and predicate evaluation.

KiVi also support <a href="Column-oriented%20DBMS">columnar storage</a> bringing the corresponding acceleration for analytical queries that only bring to memory the columns accessed by the query what saves an important amount of resources (IO, CPU, memory) when processing queries over tables with large number of columns.

Data in KiVi is distributed in horizontal fragments that correspond to range of primary keys.

KiVi is <a href="Elasticity%20%28cloud%20computing%29">elastic</a>. It allows to move data regions from one server into another. This feature can be used to balance the load in an online manner as well as to provision new nodes and decommission nodes when they are not needed anymore.

Performance.
Evaluation with benchmarks following the TPC-C specification on different cluster sizes has shown linear scalability with up to 100 nodes. Evaluation with hybrid workloads TPC-C plus analytical queries inspired on TPC-H over the TPC-C database has shown that LeanXcale can provide full isolation between both workloads.

Market Analysts.
LeanXcale has already been featured by the market analyst 451 Research and appears in their Total Data market analysis report.

<doc id="54966409" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54966409" title="Cattle smuggling in India">
Cattle smuggling in India

Cattle smuggling in India is the movement of cattle for slaughter and processing from the states of <a href="India">India</a> where <a href="Cattle%20slaughter%20in%20India">cattle slaughter</a> is illegal to those states where it is legal as well as to neighboring countries such as <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. It is widespread in India, with some estimates stating that over a million cattle are smuggled every year. 

Cattle smuggling, states Jason Cons – a professor of Anthropology with publications on India-Bangladesh border communities, is a significant source of communal tension as it implies "transportation of sacred cattle [cow] for slaughter in Muslim meat markets". It is also a source of crimes, violence and has trigerred disputes between the border officials at the India-Bangladesh border.

Within India.
According to Frederick Simoons, cattle smuggling was prevalent during the colonial era such as to the Portuguese Goa. It supplied the urban Goan demand for beef. In the post-colonial era, the reports and scale of cattle smuggling is astounding, where cattle is transported every day in thousand of trucks from Ganges Valley region to slaughterhouses in West Bengal in order to produce beef for exports. Cows are often smuggled from states such as <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> to slaughterhouses elsewhere, states Amrita Basu.

<a href="Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a> expanded its cattle slaughter-related laws in 2005 and has criminalized "killing, cruelty to and smuggling of cows".

Bangladesh.
Smuggling of cattle and other forms of trafficking is widespread across the India-Bangladesh border. Estimates place the number of illegally smuggled to over one million a year. The vested interests across all parties have failed to curb the large scale smuggling, with some Hindus also involved in the cattle smuggling operations. Cattle smuggling and trade is lucrative and it is a key means for the local elites at the India-Bangladesh border for raising money for politics and for acquiring personal wealth.

Cattle smuggling from India into Bangladesh is akin to drug smuggling networks, states Debdatta Chowdhury. A portion of the smuggled cattle – mainly cows and ox – is obtained from the western and northern states of India, which are predominantly non beef-eating Hindus, transported across India then smuggled across the West Bengal border to satisfy the demand in the predominantly beef-eating Muslim Bangladesh. The states which serve as sources of this smuggled cattle in thousands per day include <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, <a href="Haryana">Haryana</a>, <a href="Punjab">Punjab</a>, <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a>, <a href="Odisha">Odisha</a>, numbering thousands each day. According to Chowdhury, between 5000 and 15,000 cows are smuggled everyday across the Bangladesh border. The smuggling generates an average of about US$ 20 per cow in income for the smuggler, about US$ 7 in bribes for Bangladeshi border officials and about US$ 8 in bribes for Indian border officials. Another report by Ashish, Patthak and Khan in "India Today" states that the operation is a well organized racket of smugglers who use bribes, rampant corruption and evade the law almost every day. They smuggle "young and ageing" cattle from India to Bangladesh slaughterhouses, while the payment is handled through <a href="hawala">hawala</a> black market.

Other sources estimate the cattle smuggling volume at a different level. According to "The Sunday Guardian", "cattle smuggling is rampant in Bengal, with an estimated 60,000 heads of cattle being smuggled out of India into Bangladesh, every day" in 2015, but the rate of this smuggling has dropped because of rising surveillance at the international border. The cattle smuggling rate is placed at nearly two million a year by Robert Wirsing and Samir Das in a 2016 report, with an annual value of about US$ 1.5 billion.

Cattle smugglers, states "The Times of India", use dyes to recolor and camouflage the cattle. This makes cattle identification difficult to ease their smuggling across the border, while some groups use grazing pretext to evade the Indian Border Security Force.

Hundreds of thousands of cows, states the British newspaper "The Independent" in a 2012 article, are illegally smuggled from India into Bangladesh every year to be slaughtered. Gangs from both sides of the border are involved in this illegal smuggling involving an estimated 1.5 million (15 lakhs) cattle a year, and cattle theft is a source of the supply, states Andrew Buncombe. According to a 2014 report by "The International Business Times", criminal gangs steal and smuggle cattle from India into Bangladesh, an operation that yields them "hundreds of millions of dollars annually in illicit profits". Not only it hurts the cattle owners, the activity is dangerous as it leads to deaths of the "perpetrators and innocent bystanders", states Palash Ghosh.

According to "The New Indian Express", the villagers near the Bangladesh border state that cow thefts in the region increase before and during the Islamic festival of Ramzan and then these are smuggled across the border nearby. Indian border officials have been using various strategies to reduce or end the smuggling. They allege that their Bangladeshi counterparts are not doing as much as they could, states Katy Daigle, to prevent "illegal cross-border smuggling" of cattle. In contrast, some Bangladeshi officials state that cattle smuggling and associated crime would end if India would accept cow slaughter and legalize cow exports for beef production in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh and India share over 4,000 kilometers of border, with many rivers, hills, highways and rural roads. The border is quite porous to goods and people movement. The border security is limited and cattle smuggling is a common crime, states Smruti Pattanaik. According to Zahoor Rather, trade in stolen cattle is one of the important crime-related border issues between India and Bangladesh.

Impact on cattle theft in India.
Government authorities and local residents in areas surrounding Bangladesh state that frequent cattle-smuggling across the border from India is causing an increase in <a href="Cattle%20theft%20in%20India">Cattle theft in India</a> and other crimes:

Golden Grove (1786 ship)

Golden Grove was launched at Teighnmouth in 1786 as a West Indiaman, and apparently immediately sailed to the West Indies. She first entered "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Registry">Lloyd's Registry</a>" in 1793 with Tobagonian ownership. She then became a London-based West Indiaman. A Spanish privateer captured her in 1805, but the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> recaptured her within months. She then returned to the West Indian trade. After 1810 she apparently started sailing between London and Dublin and was still sailing in 1820.

Career.
Although "Golden Grove" was launched in 1786, she does not appear in "Lloyd's Register" until 1793. At that time her master is M'Leod, her owner is in Tobago, and her trade is Tobago—London.

Capture and recapture.
Around May 1805, a Spanish privateer schooner captured "Golden Grove", Blair, master, as she was sailing from Virginia to Liverpool. The privateer also captured the brig "Ceres", Meffervey, master, which had been sailing from Virginia to Guernsey. The Spaniards took both into Florida where they were condemned as prizes.

On 7 July the boats of ascended the St Mary’s River. There they recaptured "Golden Grove" and the British brig "Ceres", and captured the Spanish privateer schooner that had captured the two British vessels. A British sailor and marine were killed, and 14 were wounded. The Spaniards suffered 25 men killed (including five Americans), and 22 wounded. Most of the casualties occurred on "Golden Grove", on which the Spaniards had put 50 men, and armed with eight 6-pounder guns and six <a href="swivel%20guns">swivel guns</a>. 

On 18 August, the Jamaica Fleet, 109 vessels under the escort of four British vessels, left Jamaica for England, "Golden Grove" among them. They cleared the Gulf, but then between 21 and 23 August encountered a severe gale. Nine vessels foundered, but "Golden Grove" was among those "well" on the 25th.

Later career.
"Lloyd's Register" continues to carry "Golden Grove" for some years with unchanged information from 1805. However, the "Register of Shipping" shows a change of master and ownership in 1806.

Top fermentation is a process that is difficult to control, because unwanted bacteria might contaminate the brew due to the high ambiant temperature. The final result of a brew might vary quite drmamtically. After the first fermentation the beer is tasted and for certain beers fermented again. This second fermentation can be done in an open tub or in the bottle. In the latter case the beer is bottled with added extra sugar and yeast.

He spent a year at the <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a> before accepting a professorship at the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> where he taught until his untimely death three years later.

Davidson's initial research focused, under the direction of his mentor <a href="Frank%20Speck">Frank Speck</a>, on the <a href="Algonquian%20peoples">eastern Algonquian</a>, where he developed an archaeological approach. Already with his <a href="doctoral%20dissertation">doctoral dissertation</a> however his deep interest in the indigenous population of Australia emerged as he applied the diffusionist model of the <a href="Age-area%20hypothesis">age and area theory</a> to antipodean ethnographical materials. His doctoral thesis "The Chronological Aspects of Certain Australian Social Institutions as inferred from Geographical Distribution" was subject to a scathing critique at the time by one of the major authorities on Australian ethnography, <a href="A.%20R.%20Radcliffe-Brown">A. R. Radcliffe-Brown</a>.

A grant from the <a href="American%20Philosophical%20Society">American Philosophical Society</a> enabled him to do fieldwork over nearly two years in northern Australia (1930-1931), followed up by a further stay in 1938-1939. Over this time, Davidson managed to gather a list of native vocabularies amounting to some 4200 words, collected from informants speaking 19 different languages of Western Australia. Much of this material has yet to receive close attention from researchers.

In 1938 he published "A Preliminary Register of Australian Tribes and Hordes" together with an "An Ethnic Map of Australia," a magisterial synthesis of his close sieving of the available ethnographic materials regarding Aboriginal groups. He followed this up with a monograph in 1941 on <a href="String%20figure">Australian tribal string figures</a>, exhibiting a <a href="Prestidigitation">prestidigitator</a>'s mastery for replicating such designs which he had already demonstrated in a paper he had published in a 1927 paper on string figures among the <a href="Native%20American%20tribes%20in%20Virginia">Virginian indians</a>.

Davidson also retrieved unpublished manuscript material written by <a href="Albert%20Young%20Hassell">Edith Hassell</a> on the myths of the <a href="Koreng">Koreng</a> tribe of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, and edited it for publication over 1934 and 1935.

Polyball

The Polyball is the most prestigious public event of the <a href="ETH%20Zurich">ETH Zurich</a>. It has a long tradition since the 1880s and takes place annually at the end of November. The Polyball is the biggest decorated <a href="Ball_%28dance_party%29">ball</a> in Europe with approximately 9’000 visitors and is a classic dance event.

History.
The exact year and the location of the first Polyball - then known as "Akademie" - is unknown. A general assumption is that the first ball took place in 1880. In 1929 the name changed from Akademie to Polyball. Since the 1940s each Polyball has its one theme with respective decorations of the ballrooms.
Since its beginning in the Stadttheater Zürich (municipal theatre, now <a href="Z%C3%BCrich%20Opera%20House">Zürich Opera House</a>) the location has changed several times, such as Tonhalle Zürich, <a href="Dolder%20Grand">Grand Hotel Dolder</a>, Zürcher Messegelände (Zürich fair areal) as well as the ETH main building where it takes place today.
In 2005 a book describing the Polyball, its rich history and a collection of anecdotes was published bearing the title “Die schönste Dekoration ist das Publikum: Bilder und Geschichten aus über 100 Jahren Polyball”.

The ball.
The Polyball takes place within the main building of the ETH including the multifunctional hall. It starts at 19:00 on the last Saturday in November and ends at 05:00 on Sunday morning. The ball comprises 16 to 20 ballrooms decorated according to the ball theme. A variety of bands, from street performer to ballroom orchestra, entertain the dancers.

Organisation.
The Polyball is organized by the KOSTA foundation. It is an officially approved organisation of the <a href="VSETH">VSETH</a> and the University of Zurich (UZH) students societies. Students, and former students of ETH, UZH and other colleges form the functional body of KOSTA. The planning and preparation of the ball takes place throughout the year. The decoration is build within 4 weeks in November by numerous students who in exchange earn their tickets for the Polyball. The decoration includes the internal as well as the external of the ETH main building.

Tate Gallery (horse)

Tate Gallery (25 February 1983 – 1990) was an American-bred <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> racehorse and <a href="Horse%20breeding%23Terminology">sire</a>. A full-brother to <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20%28horse%29">Sadler's Wells</a> he won two of his five races in a track career which lasted from August 1985 until May 1986. As a two-year-old he finished unplaced in the <a href="Phoenix%20Stakes">Phoenix Stakes</a> on his debut before winning a <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> and then recorded his biggest victory in the <a href="National%20Stakes">National Stakes</a>. In the following spring he ran third in the <a href="Gladness%20Stakes">Gladness Stakes</a> and then finished last in the <a href="2000%20Guineas">2000 Guineas</a> before being retired from racing. In a brief stud career he sired several good winners, most notably <a href="Lyric%20Fantasy">Lyric Fantasy</a>.

Background.
Tate Gallery was a bay horse with a broad white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">blaze</a> and white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Leg%20markings">socks</a> on his hind legs bred in Kentucky by <a href="Robert%20Sangster">Robert Sangster</a>'s Swettenham Stud. During his racing career he carried the colours of the Greek shipping tycoon <a href="Stavros%20Niarchos">Stavros Niarchos</a> and was trained at <a href="Ballydoyle">Ballydoyle</a> by <a href="Vincent%20O%27Brien">Vincent O'Brien</a>. Both Sangster and Niarchos were partner in <a href="John%20Magnier">John Magnier</a>'s <a href="Coolmore%20Stud">Coolmore Stud</a> organisation.

Tate Gallery was ired by the Canadian stallion <a href="Northern%20Dancer">Northern Dancer</a> who won the <a href="Kentucky%20Derby">Kentucky Derby</a> in 1964 and went on to become one of the most influential sires of the 20th century. His dam Fairy Bridge was bought for $40,000 by Sangster in 1976 and was undefeated in a brief racing career conisting of two races as a juvenile in 1977. In the Irish Free Handicap for that year she was rated the joint-best two-year-old filly alongside <a href="Sookera">Sookera</a>. As a broodmare she was an outstanding success, with her other foals including Tate Gallery's full-brothers <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells">Sadler's Wells</a> and <a href="Fairy%20King%20%28horse%29">Fairy King</a>. he came from an exceptional family, being a half-sister to <a href="Nureyev%20%28horse%29">Nureyev</a> and a close relative of <a href="Thatch%20%28horse%29">Thatch</a>

Racing career.
1985: two-year-old season.
Tate Gallery had a challenging introduction to the track when he was ridden by <a href="Pat%20Eddery">Pat Eddery</a> in the <a href="Group%20race">Group 1</a> <a href="Phoenix%20Stakes">Phoenix Stakes</a> over six <a href="furlongs">furlongs</a> at <a href="Phoenix%20Park%20Racecourse">Phoenix Park Racecourse</a> on 10 August. O'Brien had not intended to run the colt in the race but changed his plans when Tate Gallery's better fancied stablemate <a href="Woodman%20%28horse%29">Woodman</a> fell sick. Depite his lack of experience he was made the <a href="Fractional%20odds">5/4</a> favourite but finished unplaced behind Roaring Riva, with Eddery easing him down when it became apparent that he had no chance of winning. Later that month he recorded his first success in a <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> over even furlongs at the <a href="Curragh%20Racecourse">Curragh</a>, winning "smoothly" from nineteen opponents.

In the National Stakes (run as a Group 1 race for the first time) over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 14 September Tate Gallery was ridden by <a href="Cash%20Asmussen">Cash Asmussen</a> and started the 4/6 favourite. The best of his eight opponents appeared to be the British filly Sweet Adelaide and the <a href="Jim%20Bolger%20%28racehorse%20trainer%29">Jim Bolger</a>-trained colt Nashamaa both of whom came ito the race unbeaten. After tracking the leaders Tate Gallery went to the front two furlongs out and stayed on well under presure to win by one and a half lengths from Nashamaa with Sweet Adelaide a further one and a half length back in third.

In the official International Classification for 1985, Tate Gallery was given a rating pf 77, six pounds behind the top-rated <a href="Bakharoff">Bakharoff</a>. The independent Timeform organisatio gave him a rating of 117p (with the "p" indicating that he was expected to make more than usual improvement) making him fourteen pounds inferior to their best two-year-old <a href="Huntingdale%20%28horse%29">Huntingdale</a>.

1986: three-year-old season.
Tate Gallery began his second season in the <a href="Gladness%20Stakes">Gladness Stakes</a> over seven furlongs at the Curragh in which he was matched against older horse. He finished third behind the four-year-old Lidhame with Timeform reporting that he "hung left and lacked enthusiasm". Despite his poor effort at the Curragh he was sent to England for the <a href="2000%20Guineas">2000 Guineas</a> at <a href="Newmarket%20Racecourse">Newmarket Racecourse</a> on 3 May. He was ridden by Tony Ives after O'Brien had first offered the ride to the recently retired <a href="Lester%20Piggott">Lester Piggott</a>. He made no impact, coming home last of the fourteen finishers behind <a href="Dancing%20Brave">Dancing Brave</a> and never raced again.

Stud career.
Tate Gallery was retired to stud and became a breeding stallion for the <a href="Coolmore%20Stud">Coolmore Stud</a> in <a href="County%20Tipperary">County Tipperary</a> at an initial fee of 15,000 guineas. He died in an accident in 1990 at the age of seven.

By far the best off his offspring was the exceptionally fast and precocious filly <a href="Lyric%20Fantasy">Lyric Fantasy</a>, but he sired a few other good winners including Surrealist (<a href="Godolphin%20Stakes">Godolphin Stakes</a>), Title Roll (<a href="King%20George%20Stakes">King George Stakes</a>), Lee Artiste (<a href="Sandy%20Lane%20Stakes">Sandy Lane Stakes</a>) He was also the damsire of the <a href="Prix%20de%20l%27Abbaye">Prix de l'Abbaye</a> winner <a href="Namid%20%28horse%29">Namid</a>.

Orders of battle for Unternehmen Schleswig-Holstein (Operation Schleswig-Holstein), 21 May 1916. The operation was a local German attack on Vimy Ridge on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

History.
Nationalist Democratic Movement – NDM has its origins in the ShopnerDesh movement started by party founder and Chairman, <a href="Bobby%20Hajjaj">Bobby Hajjaj</a>. The erosion of political values, centralization of party power, and the abeyance of democratic norms, were reasons stated by party leaders for their formation of the party.

According to party leadership NDM had the biggest launch of any political party in Bangladesh with representatives from over thirty districts convening for the official launch in Dhaka . 

Ideology.
In its official Declaration NDM lists (i) Bangladeshi Nationalism, (ii) Religious Values, (iii) Spirit of Independence, and (iv) Accountable Democracy, as their core values.
The first, Bangladeshi Nationalism, is made declared as most significant and they argue that their definition differs from the current understanding of the term in Bangladesh politics. 

Bangladeshi Nationalism.
The party’s Declaration denounces the use of the term by other political parties, especially the <a href="Bangladesh%20Nationalist%20Party">BNP</a>, and adds that theirs is a definition of complete national inclusion. They also aver that the <a href="Bangladesh%20Awami%20League">Awami League’s</a> ideology of Bengali Nationalism is outdated, stating that the citizenry is now unified under their identity as Bangladeshi and not through language, religion, or any other cultural artifact.
Their Declaration document states.
“Bangladeshi Nationalism cannot and must not ever be confused with jingoism or a philosophy of exclusion. It is an overarching philosophy of belonging, an establishment of faith in the bonds of citizenship, in the fraternity and love of each other and of nation that transcends all other constructs. Bangladeshi Nationalism is the inherent faith we have in our identity and is the bedrock of NDM.

Calm Waters

Description.
"Calm Waters" is a 2013 mixed-media <a href="Installation%20art">installation</a> by artist Kathy Bradford, which consists of seven panels of ⅜-inch thick glass that sit several inches in front of a painted abstract pattern resembling waves in blue, gray, and teal.  The glass panels consist of sand-carved clear laminated glass and clear, white, and gray etched glass. A technique known as glue-chipping, which creates a sparkle effect, is also used on the panels. The layered arrangement of glass and paint, which measures 77" x 238" overall, creates the illusion of both notable depth and change or movement as pedestrians walk past. Of the work's subject and purpose, the artist says:

“This imagery is of a large body of calm water with cloud reflections throughout the composition. This imagery is intended to transport the thoughts of the viewer, creating relaxation and calmness. Combining the art glass with the painted wall behind the glass surface creates multiple colors shifting throughout the composition. It is intended to intrigue the viewer and encourage further investigation.” -Kathy Bradford

Unternehmen Schleswig-Holstein

Unternehmen Schleswig-Holstein (Operation Schleswig-Holstein, German Attack on Vimy Ridge, 21 May) was a local German attack on 21 May at Vimy Ridge, on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. After the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Artois">Third Battle of Artois</a> (25 September – 4 November 1915) The French <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28France%29">Tenth Army</a> had held positions on the western slope of Vimy Ridge and the German <a href="6th%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">6th Army</a> occupied positions on the steeper eastern slope. After the beginning of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun">Battle of Verdun</a> (21 February – 18 December 1916), the Tenth Army was withdrawn and the British <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">First Army</a> and <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Third Army</a> on either flank, took over the French positions.

A vigorous campaign of mine warfare had been waged by the French and Germans, which the British continued, exploiting the advantage of being on the dip slope and only having to dig horizontally into the ridge to undermine German positions. The Germans, on the steeper <a href="Escarpment">scarp slope</a>, had to dig down before they could dig horizontally, which increased the German disadvantage in manpower and mining equipment. An attack was planned by the Germans to capture the British positions from which mine galleries were being dug under the German defences. Success would gain more defensive depth and forestall mine attacks on the German positions, before the British organised their defences on the ridge.

The Germans attacked on 21 May and were able to capture and consolidate their objectives before the British could organise counter-attacks powerful enough to recapture the ground. German casualties in the attack and its aftermath were the British suffered A British plan to recapture the front positions and take the German side of the ridge was cancelled, because of the demand for men and equipment of the forthcoming <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>; the <a href="Attack%20on%20the%20Gommecourt%20Salient">Attack on the Gommecourt Salient</a> took priority. British planning continued and became the basis for the much larger attack by the <a href="Canadian%20Corps">Canadian Corps</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vimy%20Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a> (9–12 April 1917).

Background.
Winter 1915–1916.
During the winter of 1915–1916, the German and French troops spent much time trying to drain and repair trenches. In the area of the German 17th Reserve Division, long trenches were dug to divert water from the front trenches and in January 1916, about of duckboards were laid by Reserve Infantry Regiment 76 alone. Conditions were so bad in the front line that both sides fraternised to alleviate the conditions and on 25 January the companies in the front line were transferred to end it. The conditions became so bad that infantry regiments were set to work as labour units to maintain the troops in the front line but the rains and French mortar fire destroyed field fortifications almost as fast as they were built. To gain more defensive depth and to mislead the French about German offensive preparations at Verdun, the <a href="I%20Royal%20Bavarian%20Reserve%20Corps">I Bavarian Reserve Corps</a> (<a href="General%20of%20the%20Infantry%20%28Germany%29">"General der Infanterie"</a> <a href="Karl%20von%20Fasbender">Karl von Fasbender</a>) conducted "Unternehmen Rupprecht" (Operation Rupprecht), several carefully prepared local attacks. Before the first attack ("Unternehmen Rupprecht" I), a battalion of Reserve Infantry Regiment 229 of the <a href="50th%20Reserve%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">50th Reserve Division</a> built fake encampments and made several approach marches to simulate a big reinforcement of the area to French reconnaissance aircraft.

"Unternehmen Rupprecht" I (Operration Rupprecht I) began on 23 January, when the <a href="2nd%20Royal%20Bavarian%20Division">2nd Bavarian Division</a> blew mines and captured several French trenches near Thélus. The 50th Reserve Division conducted "Unternehmen Rupprecht" II (Operration Rupprecht II) on 24 January and "Unternehmen Rupprecht" III (Operration Rupprecht III) on 26 January, "Rupprecht" III continuing into 27 January when the French counter-attacked. French mortar fire began at on 27 January and at French infantry made grenade attacks against Reserve Infantry Regiment 230 of the 50th Reserve Division, which managed to repulse the attacks. At the French bombardment reached the intensity of drumfire (so many shells exploded that individual reports merged into a rumble) and at the Germans were forced to retire. To the north, the 1st Bavarian Division undertook "Unternehmen Rupprecht" IV (Operation Rupprecht IV) on 28 January, to improve the Bavarian positions on Hill 145 against the troops of the French 390th and 97th Infantry Regiments of the "<a href="Chasseurs%20Alpins">Chasseurs Alpins</a>". An elaborate plan was devised, to sap forward until the front line was only from the French lines, ready for a bombardment and a mine explosion on each flank, before the I Battalion attacked. The preparations were unmistakable and the French replied with small-arms fire and artillery bombardments.

Tenth Army withdrawal.
The relief of the <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28France%29">Tenth Army</a> by the British <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">First Army</a> and <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Third Army</a> was accomplished by early March 1916. In the area of <a href="IV%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">IV Corps</a> (Lieutenant-General <a href="Henry%20Hughes%20Wilson">Henry Wilson</a>) of the First Army, the <a href="47th%20%281/2nd%20London%29%20Division">47th (1/2nd London) Division</a> took over the <a href="Berthonval">Berthonval</a> and <a href="Carency">Carency</a> sectors and the <a href="25th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">25th Division</a>, <a href="XVII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XVII Corps</a> (Lieutenant-General <a href="Julian%20Byng%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Byng%20of%20Vimy">Sir Julian Byng</a>) of the Third Army took over on the right flank. The positions were high along the western slope of Vimy Ridge and down the north-facing slope between Souchez and <a href="Givenchy-en-Gohelle">Givenchy-en-Gohelle</a>. Neither side controlled the crest and south of the Berthonval sector, the British intended to treat the front line as the main line of resistance, to protect the Talus de Zouaves ravine, which rose from the valley of the Souchez river, about back from the front line. German gunners continually bombarded the Talus, which could cut off British contact with the front positions of the 25th and 47th divisions. The head start enjoyed by the Germans in mining, made it extremely unwise for the British to pack the front line with men and only observation post were occupied.

Prelude.
German preparations.
On 15 April 1916, General <a href="Hugo%20von%20Freytag-Loringhoven">Hugo von Freytag-Loringhoven</a>, the "Stellvertretender Generlaquartiermeister" (Deputy Quartermaster-General) of "<a href="Oberste%20Heeresleitung">Oberste Heeresleitung</a>" ("OHL", Supreme Army Command) took over the <a href="17th%20Reserve%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">17th Reserve Division</a> in the Vimy sector while its commander General <a href="Ernst%20Balthasar%20von%20Zieten">Ernst Balthasar von Zieten</a> was on sick leave, then took over command of the <a href="IX%20Reserve%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Reserve Corps</a> temporarily for General <a href="Max%20von%20Boehn%20%28general%29">Max von Boehn</a>. Loringhoven found that the sector was by no means quiet, with a constant drain of casualties from mine blasts and night attacks. At the end of April, Loringhoven decided that a more permanent reply to the British was necessary and began to think in terms of forcing the British back beyond the positions the Germans had held before the Third Battle of Artois and occupy the British mine galleries. German regimental accounts also emphasised the effect on morale of the continuous uncertainty caused by British mining and the prospect of entombment. In another account, the inability of the Germans to reply in kind, due to a lack of resources was lamented. By the time that the <a href="4th%20Guards%20Infantry%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">4th Guard Division</a> relieved the 1st Bavarian Division opposite the British 25th Division in early May, British mine attacks were increasing in frequency; the divisional pioneer companies were supplemented by "Bergmannszüge" (Mine Sections) and the pioneer units of the 1st Bavarian Division were retained. Loringhoven used his influence to mass eighty artillery batteries for the operation, on the of front from <a href="Li%C3%A9vin">Liévin</a>, a suburb of Lens, to Vimy, all carefully hidden between houses and in buildings. British positions were photographed by reconnaissance aircrews and aircraft reinforcements and anti-aircraft guns, some on lorries, were used to deter British reconnaissance aircraft. Telephone silence was enforced and a stream of trucks delivered ammunition, unnoticed by the British.

Plan.
As the greater part of the attack was to be conducted by "Schleswig-Holsteinisches Infanterie-Regiment Nr." 163 of the 17th Reserve Division, it was named "<a href="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>" and orders for the operation were issued on 9 May. The attack was to begin in the middle of the month but postponements delayed the attack until British Summer Time) on 21 May. The front was divided into three sectors, South with Foot Guard Regiment 5 (4th Guard Division), Centre with Reserve Infantry Regiment 86 of the 18th Reserve Division and North with Infantry Regiment 163 from the 17th Reserve Division, all three sector regiments being reinforced by machine-gun and engineer units; two more infantry regiments were held in reserve. Eighty artillery batteries, including the artillery of IX Reserve Corps, IV Corps and the Guard Reserve Corps, plus six batteries of heavy howitzers and nine mortar batteries, along with six heavy, nine medium and eight light <a href="Minenwerfer">Minenwerfer</a> were to participate. Sufficient ammunition was provided for batteries to fire at 200 shells per hour and counter-battery reconnaissance aircrews managed to locate 83 British artillery emplacements.

British defensive preparations.
The 25th Division reported that bombardments and mining had created a wilderness of shell-holes and craters, where an endless struggle on and under the ground was waged; rather than develop the front line, the British concentrated on consolidating the support lines. On the left of the 15th Division, the Berthonval sector was also in a poor state, with hardly any barbed wire and watched over by Germans in advanced posts in the mine craters. Small posts had been dug between the front line and the support lines but daylight movement in them was impossible, because of the danger from observed German artillery-fire. Unusually on the Western front, the British had better observation of German positions and the area behind, from vantage points on the east side of the Lorette Spur, which was about beyond the river, north-west of Souchez

Attack.
21 May.
The German artillery began the preparatory bombardment at firing gas shell at the support and reserve positions behind the British front line for ten minutes and then all guns began to sweep from the British front line to the rear and back again, ready to bombard simultaneously the British front line at German observers in balloons and aircraft were watching for British artillery-fire ready to direct counter-battery fire, the balloon observers spotting 60 batteries and the aircrew another 23 batteries. The German artillery continued until each battery of four guns firing at the rate of 200 shells per hour, against which the British artillery reply was disorganised. As German shells fell on the British support and reserve lines and approaches the guns still firing on the front line lifted the range by at ; a minute later the infantry attack began. On the front of Reserve "Jäger" Battalion 9 (RJB 9) the 1st and 4th companies advanced to encounter determined resistance from the British infantry in the front trench, which was quickly overcome. The fight for the British reserve trench was much harder, particularly in sections where the German bombardment has been least effective. Some British troops erected barricades in parts of the trench and then fought until all were killed. Liaison between German units was difficult and later a fighting patrol was sent to gain touch with Footguard Regiment 5 (FR 5). On the right flank, RIR 86 had advanced so far that the 4th Company RJB 9 attacked again to reach the same line but became bogged down among British reserve positions. Several small British counter-attacks were repulsed during the night but the main effort went into consolidating the new positions and linking them to the old front line.

On the front of FR 5 the reinforced II Battalion was to a narrow-front attack straight down Hill 145 and just before <a href="Military%20designation%20of%20days%20and%20hours">H-Hour</a> the battalion was squeezed into every patch of cover up Hill 145 from the "Transfeld" Crater. After the bombardment from the troops attacked and a mine exploded, creating the "Schleswig-Holstein" (Broadmarsh) Crater. A British machine-gun crew fired from the south and hit several German machine-gunners, preventing the Germans from occupying the crater until the gun was silenced. Another German platoon was shot down by a British machine-gun on the far side of the "Transfeld" Crater but the German infantry managed to advance between the two craters and close the gaps that had appeared in the German line as the Germans and British fought with hand-grenades and by touch had been gained with RJB 9 on the left and the 5th Company on the right. Several troops tried to rush the British third line but were caught in crossfire and killed. An officer jumped into a trench and cut the all the wires he could find but engineers advancing with the infantry failed to find any mine entrances.

About an hour later the British trenches had been occupied and a mine gallery was discovered off a blind <a href="Sapping">sap</a> (a trench with a dead-end) with 16 British troops inside behind a barricade; the British surrendered once they had been discovered. The Germans had great difficulty consolidating their new positions, in the dark, under artillery-fire and counter-attack and in the 8th Company area the troops formed a human chain, to pass hand-grenades forward. As dawn broke the new positions had been dug down to head height but linking the new diggings to the lips of craters was done with great difficulty because the explosions had thrown a great deal of earth onto the crater edges and British troops were throwing grenades into the craters. Communication trenches were too shallow and soldiers had to crawl along them once dawn had broken and many were hit by bullets. The captured trenches had much British equipment in them which was used by the Germans to repulse counter-attacks.

Aftermath.
Analysis.
In the first 1916 volume of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Great%20War">History of the Great War</a> (1932), the official historian, <a href="James%20Edward%20Edmonds">James Edward Edmonds</a> wrote that the Germans judged "Unternehmen Schleswig-Holstein" a complete success. Reserve Infantry Regiment 86 reported that there had been little British resistance but the other battalions noted hand-to-hand fighting and enfilade fire from the flanks. Consolidation of the captured ground had begun at once but some German companies had been unable to identify their objectives because of the state of the ground and advanced too far. The troops too far forward had been caught in their own barrage and it took much of the night to bring the troops back to the objective. Some companies were still out of position when dawn broke and it took until on 22 May to find the right objectives. Orders were given to stop consolidation during the day, to deny the British any clues as to the position of the new line. British guns extensively bombarded the German approaches and at noon, some German shells fell on the new front line. The German infantry fired green flares, to get the artillery to increase the range but this gave away the line, which the British then subjected to massed heavy artillery-fire.

Edmonds wrote that the German attack showed that with plenty of artillery and observation over British positions, the Germans could capture a small part of the British defences. For a British counter-attack to succeed, it would need a similar mass of artillery was necessary and if the guns had to be brought in, a delay would be needed. The large amount of artillery that the Germans had assembled for the attack and their sapping forward from the new positions, led Allenby to suspect that the Vimy attack was a preliminary to an attack on Arras. With the German involved in offensive operations in Russia and at Verdun, Haig thought that a bigger attack was unlikely. The 6th Army did have a plan for an attack but this needed another 12 divisions and 40 batteries of heavy artillery, which were engaged elsewhere. Wilson thought that the British could leave things as they were, on the assumption that the Germans would be content to consolidate their gains but if not, he wanted to conduct a similar operation to re-capture the top of the ridge and take the German positions down the reverse slope as far as the German mine entrances.

Haig thought that IV Corps had bungled its defence but with the imminence of the offensive on the Somme, a big enough attack would need a reinforcement of 40 British heavy artillery batteries. Haig thought that the guns could be returned to the Somme if the attack could be completed in two weeks but it would be dependent on the German reaction, put the existing positions at risk and delay the return of the guns. Haig decided that an attempt to take Vimy Ridge would use the resources intended for the diversionary <a href="Attack%20on%20the%20Gommecourt%20Salient">Attack on the Gommecourt Salient</a>. The German had gained observation over the British lines but not to the extent that they were made untenable and on 17 May Haig ordered the First Army that there would be no attack and that IV Corps would be instructed to plan for a much bigger attack, which became the basis of the scheme for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vimy%20Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a> (9–12 April 1917).

Casualties.
In 1932, Edmonds recorded 1,344 German casualties; 615 men in the attack and 729 during British counter-attacks. British casualties in the 47th Division from 22 to 24 May were 1,571, 2nd Division casualties were 267 and the 7th Brigade (25th Division) had 637 casualties, a total of 2,475.

Subsequent operations.
After 24 May the fighting on the ridge diminished and the Germans did not take over the former British support line. Troops of the 99th and 6th brigades edged forward and dug a new line up the slope from the Talus des Zouaves. Mining in the Berthonval sector was not renewed and instead, German mine entrances were bombarded constantly by guns and trench mortars and tunnels dug on the east slope of Zouave Valley as shelter for infantry in support. Freytag-Loringhoven returned to "OHL" on 31 May.

Edward Sutton Smalley

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Multiple_issues

Edward Sutton Smalley (1589- February 10th,1665) was born about 1589 in Bideford,Devon,England. Edward came to Maine about 1632 with his son Francis. Edward, with Francis Champernowne and others, founded Piscataqua, which was afterwards divided into the towns of Kittery, Eliot, South Berwich and Berwick.
He was on a grand jury in 1640 in Saco and a magistrate in Falmouth in 1645 and later went to the Isle of Shoals. Although he built a house in Piscataqua, before 1643, as a grant of one hundred acres made to him by Thomas Gorges, the deputy governor of the Province of Maine. Edward Smalley might have been a son of Sir Walter Raleigh but there is no concrete evidence to prove this, based upon research by several recognized genealogists. 
"There is also much speculation that Edward Smalley was a brother to John Small, who migrated to New England in the early 1600's, but recent DNA testing seems to have ruled this out. Several DNA tests for descendants for both Edward and John Small have not shown common genetic markers."

United Nations Security Council Resolution 2371

The <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> unanimously adopted Resolution 2371 on August 5, 2017, with approval of all the five <a href="Permanent%20members%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">permanent members</a> and the ten non-permanent members in response to <a href="DPRK">North Korea’s</a> <a href="2017%20North%20Korean%20missile%20tests">July 2017 missile tests</a>. 

The resolution tightened economic sanctions for the 6th time, since they were first imposed in 2006, when North Korea had its <a href="2006%20North%20Korean%20nuclear%20test">first nuclear test</a>.

The new restrictions ban purchases of North Korean coal, iron, lead and seafood (the country’s main exports). According to some estimates, this will deprive the regime of $1 billion a year—a third of its foreign earnings. The sanctions also prohibit governments around the world from admitting any more North Korean workers, as the regime pockets most of their wages.

Background.
Before adopting this resolution, North Korea had conducted 14 missile tests in 2017, advancing its capabilities to eventually deliver a nuclear warhead. The <a href="2017%20North%20Korean%20missile%20tests">tests in July of 2017</a> were of <a href="Intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missiles</a>. For the first time they demonstrated the capability by the DPR Korea to deliver warheads to even as far as part of the continental U.S.

Continued efforts by North Korea in advancing the host of technologies to allow them to launch a nuclear strike, led the UN to for the 6th time impose tightening economic sanctions against the country since they were first imposed in 2006.

Sanctions.
The resolution imposes several full sectoral bans on exports North Korea uses to fund its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, namely:

Sanctions also tighten North Korea's access to the international financial system, by expanding prior financial sanctions to include a foreign asset freeze of North Korea's <a href="Foreign%20Trade%20Bank%20of%20the%20Democratic%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Korea">Foreign Trade Bank</a>.

It also bans countries from accepting new <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20North%20Korea%23North%20Korean%20workers%20sent%20abroad">North Korean laborers</a>.

Analysis.
According to some estimates, the new tightening of sanctions will deprive the regime of $1 billion a year, a third of its foreign earnings.

According to sources interviewed by <a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>, the regime has grown adept at dodging the restrictions, using illicit slush funds in China to finance business partnerships. The higher commissions on offer for such risky transactions simply attract more capable middlemen. Enforcement has been patchy: of the UN’s 193 members, only 77 have reported on their implementation of the previous round of sanctions, adopted in November 2016.

Further, China, which accounts for more than 90% of North Korea’s trade, has promised to apply the new restrictions “fully and strictly”. However, they do not include the one measure thought likely to cause the regime real difficulty: a curb on the North’s imports of oil.

Gabriel de Solages

Gabriel de Solages (19 August 1711 – 28 July 1799) was a French soldier and industrialist.

Early years.
The Solages family is mentioned in documents from 1028.
In 1724 they gained large landholdings in <a href="Carmaux">Carmaux</a> by marriage.
Gabriel, chevalier de Solages, seigneur de Saint-Benott et de Blaye, was born on 19 August 1711.
He was received as a page of the king on 15 September 1729. 
He campaigned in Italy with his brothers as a lieutenant in the Royal-Carabineers regiment, and later fought in Germany and Bohemia.
He rose through the ranks, becoming mestre-de-camp for a brigade of carabineers.
On 13 October 1749 he married Marie de Juillot de Longchamps, daughter of Jean-François de Juillot de Longchamps, equerry, and of Françoise de Guyot.

Industrialist.
On 19 December 1752 the king granted Gabriel de Solages the concession of coal mines at Carmaux.
His brother, the marquis Antoine Paulin, had already received this concession in 1747 and 1748, but had been obliged to abandon it. 
He received a license to found a glass factory at Carmaux by decree of 2 May 1751.
Gabriel was intelligent and energetic.
At this time industry was developing in France and was looking for coal as an alternative to increasingly scarce wood.
In 1752 Gabriel de Solages received a concession for mining within a radius on one league around his Blaye château.
The mining rights would remain in the Solages family until the <a href="Compagnie%20mini%C3%A8re%20de%20Carmaux">Compagnie minière de Carmaux</a> was nationalized in 1947.
In 1754 Gabriel installed a glass bottle factory near his château fueled by the coal.
Gabriel de Solages invited Flemish miners to work his mines, but also employed local people..

Gabriel de Solages was made a brigadier of cavalry on 16 March 1767
He was appointed the king's commanding officer in <a href="Albigeois">Albigeois</a> on 15 November 1770.
He was promoted to maréchal-de-camp on 1 March 1780.
Solages was able to operate without competition, and was not forced to close the mines in 1789 when the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> began.
At that time he was employing 100 workers.
He was arrested in 1793 and his mines were placed under sequestration.
A decree by the <a href="Committee%20of%20Public%20Safety">Committee of Public Safety</a> of 24 Frimaire year III (13 December 1794) retored the lands and defined the limits of the concession..

His wife died in October 1827 at 103 years of age.

<doc id="54967210" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54967210" title="Every Lover's Sign">
Every Lover's Sign

"Every Lover's Sign" is a song by the British duo <a href="The%20Lover%20Speaks">The Lover Speaks</a>, released in 1986 as third single from their self-titled <a href="The%20Lover%20Speaks%20%28album%29">debut album</a>. It was written by <a href="David%20Freeman%20%28musician%29">David Freeman</a> and Joseph Hughes, and produced by <a href="Jimmy%20Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a> and The Lover Speaks.

Background.
David Freeman and Joseph Hughes formed The Lover Speaks in 1985, having previously worked together in the punk outfit <a href="The%20Flys%20%28UK%20band%29">The Flys</a>. After signing to A&M Records in early 1986, the band recorded their self-titled debut album with <a href="Jimmy%20Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a>. The lead single, "<a href="No%20More%20I%20Love%20You%27s">No More "I Love You's"</a>", was released in July that year and peaked at No. 58 in the UK. In August, the album was released, but failed to chart, as did a second single, "Tremble Dancing" when released in September.

In October, "Every Lover's Sign" was released as the album's third single (and second in America). For its release as a single, Bruce Forest and <a href="Andy%20Wallace%20%28producer%29">Andy Wallace</a> were hired to remix the song. Together, at Sigma Sound Studios in New York, they created a 7" remix, along with an extended version (known as "New Extended Mix" or "New York Mix") and a "Dub Mix", both designed for club play. The "Dub Mix" was edited by <a href="The%20Latin%20Rascals">The Latin Rascals</a> (Albert Cabrera and <a href="Tony%20Moran">Tony Moran</a>) and additional keyboards provided by David Coles. Although it failed to chart in the UK, the song became a club hit in America, reaching No. 6 on the "Billboard" Dance Club Songs Chart and remaining on the chart for nine weeks. Attempts to capitalise on the club success of the song, A&M tried to generate airplay to break the song onto the "Billboard" Hot 100, but they were unsuccessful. It was the duo's only chart entry in the States.

As with each track on "The Lover Speaks" album, "Every Lover's Sign" is a reference to a concept in <a href="Roland%20Barthes">Roland Barthes</a>' book "" ("Fragments d'un discours amoureux"). In the liner notes of the 2015 re-issue of the album, Freeman revealed of the track's lyrics: "Lyrically, "Every Lover's Sign" is a simple concept. Every single sign that any lover makes ever at any time in history has already been made before. Nothing is new. The whole language of love is there before we are born. The idea of that song is that everything I could do to prove I love you outwardly is coming from a pop parade that has existed before we were born." The song is Hughes' favourite from the album. Recalling the demo version the duo produced prior to the album, he said: "The original demo had an aura we couldn't quite capture, but it didn't matter as the album version was great."

Release.
"Every Lover's Sign" was released by A&M Records on 7" and 12" vinyl in the UK, Germany, America and Canada. In January 1987, it was given a release in Australia too. The B-Side on all releases was the "Dub Mix" version of the song, except in the UK, where a "Dub Mix (Edit)" version was included. For the 12" vinyl, the extended version of the song was featured, known as "New Extended Mix" in the States and "New York Mix" elsewhere. The North American versions of the single featured a different picture sleeve to the one released in the UK and Germany.

In 2015, to coincide with the Cherry Pop re-issue of "The Lover Speaks" album, DJ Paul Goodyear reconstructed the "Dub Remix" of the song, which was named the "SanFranDisko Expanded Edition Re-Rub". It was given away as a free download, through "<a href="Classic%20Pop%20magazine">Classic Pop magazine</a>", to those who purchased the re-issue.






Critical reception.
Upon release, "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" listed the song under the "Recommended" section of the "Pop" category. They described the song as "new romantic-type British technopop". In another issue of "Billboard", Brian Chin spoke of the song: "<a href="Level%2042">Level 42</a>'s "<a href="World%20Machine%20%28song%29">World Machine</a>" smashes <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>'s record for most-delayed single release; the cut was playing off the album a year ago. But the <a href="Shep%20Pettibone">Shep Pettibone</a> remix is excellent and worthwhile; certainly, the single should be a pop priority... same is true of the Lover Speaks' "Every Lover's Sign", which is already charting dance. Especially as remixed by Bruce Forest, this is the kind of material that the <a href="Thompson%20Twins">Thompson Twins</a> are desperately in need of..." In December 1986, the song was voted best new song of the week ("Screamers of the Week") by listeners of <a href="WLIR">WLIR</a> 92.7 FM.

In a contemporary review of the album, Terry Atkinson of "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" said: "Though its ultra-romantic, stylishly emotional approach sometimes leads to Tears for Fears/Wham! mush, this new English duo bows with a frequently intriguing album. Unusual arrangements interweave a male voice with Freeman's female-like background vocals, enhancing the best tracks here - big-boom ballads "No More 'I Love You's'," "Still Faking This Art of Love," "Every Lover's Sign" and the impressionistic "Of Tears.""

In a retrospective review of the album, Michael Sutton of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> commented: ""Every Lover's Sign" and "Never to Forget You" offer respite from all the melancholy confessions; however, it's the stinging ache in tracks such as "Face Me and Smile," a tale of infidelity, that linger after the album has finished spinning." Imran Khan of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" said: "...other numbers, like "Every Lover's Sign", evince the sunny and clean jubilance of America's West Coast beaches. Singer David Freeman has a powerfully commanding baritone which he accents with a slightly overwrought, Jacobean flourish, infusing these ringing pop tunes with a sense of Olympian grandeur."

In 2013, Ira Israel of "<a href="HuffPost">The Huffington Post</a>" included the song in his blog article "10 Amazing Pop Songs & Ballads You May Have Missed". He said: "I know I'm going to take alot of flak on this one. It's so terribly dated, I know. But try to look past the electronic drums to hear the backing vocals over the chorus. I would put this up against Jimmy Iovine's other hit from that era anytime: <a href="Stevie%20Nicks">Stevie Nicks</a>' "<a href="Stand%20Back">Stand Back</a>.""

FBUs Pokalturnering

FBUs Pokalturnering (unofficial <a href="English%20language">English</a> translation: Funen Cup) was a <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> regional <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament">knockout</a> <a href="association%20football">association football</a> competition contested annually from 1920 to 1953 by clubs that were members of the regional football association <a href="DBU%20Funen">Funen FA</a> (FBU). Organised by and named after <a href="DBU%20Funen">FBU</a>, it was the third regional cup competition introduced, and the second in the province, after the <a href="KBUs%20Pokalturnering">KBUs Pokalturnering</a> in 1910 and the <a href="LFBUs%20Pokalturnering">LFBUs Pokalturnering</a> in 1915. For the most part, the matches in the competition took place during the course of the fall season, beginning in the summer months with the first round, and culminating in a final later in the same half season, but due to scheduling some finals were not played until the following year. The <a href="Funen">Funen</a> cup tournament was discontinued after the <a href="1953%20FBUs%20Pokalturnering">1953 edition</a> ahead of the introduction of the national-wide cup competition beginning in 1954, <a href="DBU%20Pokalen">Danish Cup</a>, organised by the <a href="Danish%20Football%20Association">Danish FA</a> (DBU).

The competition rules varied throughout the years, but has always been open to all Funen FA member clubs, and as a consequence the number of participants have varied greatly throughout its history beginning from 7 teams in the <a href="1920%20FBUs%20Pokalturnering">1920 edition</a> and increasing the number to 39 teams in the <a href="1936%20FBUs%20Pokalturnering">1936 edition</a>.

Between 1920 and 1928, the rules stated that an additional <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football">extra time</a> (two periods of 15 minutes each) should be played to determine finals, that were tied after full time (90 minutes). In 1929, the rules were changed, so that a replay match was scheduled, if a semi-final or final match was tied. Despite the <a href="Danish%20Football%20Association">Danish FA</a> etablishing the short-lived nation-wide cup tournament, <a href="Danmarkspokalturneringen">Danmarkspokalturneringen</a> in 1940, the regional Funen Cup tournament continued its existence.

The most successful club in the history of the tournament's 33 editions was <a href="Boldklubben%201909">B 1909</a>, who won a total of 14 cup titles and appeared as a losing finalist on 9 occasions. Only 7 clubs, and mostly clubs from the main city of the island of Funen, <a href="Odense">Odense</a> (especially <a href="Boldklubben%201909">B 1909</a>, <a href="Boldklubben%201913">B 1913</a> and <a href="Odense%20Boldklub">Odense BK</a>), appeared in the finals. A club had to win five cup championship finals, also known as "lots", in order to keep the trophy permanently; the first trophy distributed during the tournament's duration was won by <a href="Boldklubben%201909">B 1909</a> in <a href="1930%20KBUs%20Pokalturnering">1930</a>.

Results by team.
Teams shown in "italics" are no longer in existence. <a href="Boldklubben%201909">B 1909</a> won the second and last edition, won the most cup titles and lost the second largest amount of final matches.

List of bankrupts

<a href="Personal%20bankruptcy">Personal bankruptcy</a> (also known as personal insolvency) law allows, in certain jurisdictions, an individual to be declared <a href="bankruptcy">bankrupt</a>, which is a legal status of a person or other entity that cannot repay the debts it owes to creditors. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a court order, often initiated by the debtor. Personal bankruptcy is distinguished from corporate bankruptcy, which generally does not directly affect the business owners' personal assets.

Modern bankruptcy law often distinguishes "reorganization", in which only some of the bankrupt's assets are taken, a repayment plan is devised and part of the debt is <a href="Bankruptcy%20discharge">discharged</a>, from <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a>. In the latter type of bankruptcy, all of the debtors assets are included in the bankruptcy estate, sometimes in addition to his disposable income for a period of time, after which all of the debts are discharged.

The details vary between jurisdictions. In the USA, the liquidation bankruptcy is governed by <a href="Chapter%207%2C%20Title%2011%2C%20United%20States%20Code">Chapter 7</a> of the <a href="Title%2011%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Code">Title 11 of the United States Code</a> and is generally available to individuals passing a <a href="means%20test">means test</a>. Reorganization bankruptcy is governed by Chapters <a href="Chapter%2011%2C%20Title%2011%2C%20United%20States%20Code">11</a> and <a href="Chapter%2013%2C%20Title%2011%2C%20United%20States%20Code">13</a>. Chapter 11 is mostly used by high net-worth individuals. In the 12-month period ending June 30, 2017, Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings accounted for, respectively, 474,258 (61%) and 1,099 (0.14%) out of 772,594 nonbusiness bankruptcy filings in the USA.

Notable bankrupts.
Bankruptcy filings by celebrities generate extensive publicity, which has been cited as a factor contributing to a shift towards a less negative public perception of personal bankruptcy observed since the 1960s. Lawyers have reported using celebrity examples to persuade their clients to file for bankruptcy.

Listed below are notable individuals who filed for personal bankruptcy or were subject to a similar form of insolvency management process. The list does not include business bankruptcies and bankruptcies that were not officially recognized.

May/September

May/September is a 2014 site-specific, permanent <a href="Installation%20art">art installation</a> created by artist Rob Ley, which is located on the south exterior wall of the Parking Garage on the <a href="Sidney%20and%20Lois%20Eskenazi%20Hospital">Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital</a> campus, near downtown <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, and is part of the <a href="Eskenazi%20Health%20Art%20Collection">Eskenazi Health Art Collection</a>.

Description.
"May/September" is a 2014 site-specific, permanent <a href="Installation%20art">art installation</a> created by artist Rob Ley located on the south exterior wall of the Parking Garage on the <a href="Sidney%20and%20Lois%20Eskenazi%20Hospital">Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital</a> campus. The work, which measures 60' x 245' x 4', consists of approximately 6,500 anodized aluminum “leaves” or panels of differing angles generally arranged vertically on the vast plane of the parking garage in order to create an “interactive, synthetic terrain.” Inspired by colors found in Hoosier artist T.C. Steele’s Four Seasons, works that are part of a larger mural project created for the hospital more than a century ago, and the changing of Indiana’s four recognizable seasons, the east sides of the installed aluminum panels feature a vibrant yellow color, while west-facing panel faces are dark indigo.  This directional color program, in tandem with the differing angles and depths of protrusions, results in a dynamic façade that appears soft and undulating, ever-changing with the viewer’s position and speed.  May/September was manufactured in collaboration with Indianapolis Fabrications, also known as  iFab, an Indianapolis-based creative project fabrication company.

Crossroads (mural)

Crossroads is a 2013 mural that consists of two paintings ("Crossroads I" and "Crossroads II") by artist Ismael Muhammud Nieves located within the Eskenazi Outpatient Care Center on the <a href="Sidney%20and%20Lois%20Eskenazi%20Hospital">Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital</a> campus, near downtown <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, and is part of the <a href="Eskenazi%20Health%20Art%20Collection">Eskenazi Health Art Collection</a>.

Description.
"Crossroads" is a 2013 mural that consists of two <a href="Acrylic%20paint">acrylic</a> on canvas paintings ("Crossroads I" and "Crossroads II") by artist Ismael Muhammud Nieves. Each framed work measures 158 x 49.5 inches. Inspired by sitting on a porch or gazing out a window, letting the mind wander across the landscape, Nieves created a bright composition of Indiana native flowers and plants by incorporating emblematic images from the <a href="Eskenazi%20Health%20Art%20Collection">Eskenazi Health</a> art collection together with <a href="Native%20Americans">Native American</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Indiana%20state%20symbols">Indiana state symbols</a> incorporated with <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> shapes:

“Indiana’s landscape is beautiful year-round. The landscape has been enjoyed through contemporary eyes as well as the Native Americans who call this land home. Throughout the mural are woodland scenes directly inspired from the Eskenazi Health Art Collection.  The animals, trees, and foliage in the murals are native to Indiana. Incorporating graffiti shapes and palette, in my opinion, creates a fun atmosphere for the waiting area. There are parts of my painting that were inspired by Eskenazi Health’s existing art collection. I challenge the viewers to identify them.” -Ismael Muhammad Nieves

Temporal Synapse

Temporal Synapse is a 2013 six-part permanent, reactive <a href="Installation%20art">art installation</a> created by Project One located inside <a href="Sidney%20and%20Lois%20Eskenazi%20Hospital">Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital</a>, near downtown <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, and is part of the <a href="Eskenazi%20Health%20Art%20Collection">Eskenazi Health Art Collection</a>.

Description.
"Temporal Synapse" is a 2013 six-part permanent, reactive <a href="Installation%20art">art installation</a> by Project One, the collaboration between artists and architects Kyle Perry and Adam Buente. Inspired by the physicality of synapses in the brain, which permit signals between cells, allowing data and information to surge through the body, the artists set out to mimic this communication process outside the body, between users and their environment.

Located in the elevator bays on the first six levels of Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital, these "Temporal Synapse" feature walls consist of cast <a href="Acrylic%20resin">acrylic</a> panels that feature a graphic pattern based upon cellular structures found within the body. Through the use of a fisheye camera, video tracking technology tracks visitors’ positions in space, which, in turn, directs reciprocal “cells” to light up, visually representing the interaction between those waiting and their environment. While each of the panels measure 149" in width, they range in height from 95"-107", depending on ceiling height. 

Historical information.
Acquisition.
"Temporal Synapse" was commissioned by <a href="Eskenazi%20Health%20Art%20Collection">Eskenazi Health</a> as part of a re-imagining of the organization's <a href="Eskenazi%20Health%20Art%20Collection">historical art collection</a> and to support "the sense of optimism, vitality and energy" of its new <a href="Sidney%20and%20Lois%20Eskenazi%20Hospital">campus</a> in 2013. In response to its nationwide request for proposals, Eskenazi Health received more than 500 submissions from 39 states, which were then narrowed to 54 finalists by an independent jury. Each of the 54 proposals was assigned an area of the new hospital by Eskenazi Health's art committee and publicly displayed in the existing Wishard Hospital and online for public comment; more than 3,000 public comments on the final proposals were collected and analyzed in the final selection. 

Location.
"Temporal Synapse" is located in the Blue Elevator Bays on levels 1-6 of <a href="Sidney%20and%20Lois%20Eskenazi%20Hospital">Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital</a>.

Artist.
Founded in 2009, Project One is a collaboration between Muncie, Indiana-based artists and architects Adam Buente and Kyle Perry, both of whom earned B.S. and M.Arch degrees from <a href="Ball%20State%20University">Ball State University</a>. In 2009, the partners received an Innovation Award from the national Robert Bruce Thompson Annual Student Light Fixture Design Competition for their prototype “Morpholuminescence.”

Condition.
"Temporal Synapse" is structurally and physically stable and in undamaged condition.
